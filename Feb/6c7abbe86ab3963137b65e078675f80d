Bournemouth believe they have convinced Thierry Henry to become their new manager, according to the UK Mirror. Henry is currently in charge of Montreal in the Major League Soccer (MLS). The 43-year-old is top of a shortlist that includes his former Arsenal team-mate Patrick Vieira, John Terry and former Huddersfield boss David Wagner. Henry had spent time working as Roberto Martinezâ€™s assistant in the Belgium national team, before taking over at Monaco in 2018. The France international was named boss at Montreal in November 2019, signing a two-year contract. Jason Tindall, who took over from Eddie Howe after the Cherries were relegated, was sacked by Bournemouth two weeks ago.
