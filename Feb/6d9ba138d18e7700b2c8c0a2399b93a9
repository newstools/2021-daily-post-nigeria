The Department of State Services (DSS) has denied that its operatives attempted to arrest Sunday Igboho on Friday. The Yoruba activist, real name Sunday Adeyemo, was blocked by a team of security agents on Friday at about 2 pm. The situation caused a scene in front of a Satguru Maharaj Ji village, along the Lagos Ibadan highway. In a viral video, Igboho took off his clothes and challenged the DSS, Police and Army officers. Others in his convoy and those who recognized him in the area resisted the attempted arrest. But the DSS has dismissed reports that Igboho was a target. “The said news is misinforming and should be taken as fake and therefore be disregarded”, DSS spokesman, Peter Afunanya, said in a terse statement. The news drew condemnation as Nigerians query the government for failing to send security agencies to apprehend bandits. On Friday, hundreds of students of the Government Girls Secondary School in Zamfara State were abducted. Last week, staff, students and their relatives were taken from another Government School in Kagara, Niger State.
