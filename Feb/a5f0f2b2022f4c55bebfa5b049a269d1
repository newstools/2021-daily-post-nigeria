A Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, in Anambra State, Mr Valentine Ozigbo has applauded the national leadership of the PDP for the early release of dates for the party’s primary election. Ozigbo described the efforts of the party as pragmatic and proactive. PDP on Wednesday published the timetable for the primary election and other related activities, in readiness for the Anambra governorship election scheduled to hold on the 6th of November. The party said its primary election would be held on Saturday, June 26, 2021. Addressing journalists in Awka, Ozigbo said, “The timely release of the timetable and schedule of activities leading up to PDP’s primary election, speaks volumes about our party’s preparedness and determination to rescue Anambra State from the maladministration of the incumbent APGA government. “The timetable gives room for adequate preparations and more importantly, a hitch-free primary and electoral process. This is a step in the right direction for the Anambra State chapter of the PDP.” “The early release of the primary election timetable makes room for adequate time for proper planning and seamless execution of the planned activities. It would eliminate the hitherto, fire brigade style where for lack of ample time, things get tangled and twisted. “There will also be sufficient time lapse between the party’s primary election and the main election in November, such that any internal disputes could be resolved before heading out to the general election,” Ozigbo said.
