Ahead of their Champions League round of 16 tie against Chelsea on Tuesday, Felipe Luis has said Atletico Madrid manager, Diego Simeone has been successful at the club because he has “no heart.” Luis noted that in his all-encompassing desire to be the best, the Argentine tactician has no sense of “fun.” Simeone has spent 10 years in charge of the Rojiblancos, delivering a Liga title triumph and memorable runs to Champions League finals. They will battle Chelsea later today in the first leg, round of 16 tie in Spain as they hunt for major silverware this season. “Take my word for it, it’s not easy to play for Simeone. He has no heart. He never says to himself: ‘Oh, what a pity, poor little player, I need to do this or that’. No. He will decide what he has to decide solely in order to win,” Luis told Daily Mail “When he took over in 2011 the team was four points off relegation and he made them Europa League winners the same season. He turned them into the monstrous side they are now. That success has one name: Diego Simone. “He’ll never do ‘ah, let’s have fun today’ session.”
