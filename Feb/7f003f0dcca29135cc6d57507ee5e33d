Neymar said he has a brotherly relationship with Mbbape, adding that he likes to play together with the France World Cup winner. Mbappe has 18 months remaining on his current contract with PSG and has drawn the interest of Real Madrid and Liverpool in the past few weeks. “I have adapted. I feel calmer, and I am very happy here,” Neymar told French television channel TF1. “I want to stay at PSG, and I hope Kylian [Mbappe] will stay too. “Of course, that is the wish of every PSG supporter. With Kylian, we have a relationship of brothers … We really like to play together. “We want PSG to be a great team, and I want to continue doing what I have done every day in Paris – play football and be happy. That is the most important thing.”
