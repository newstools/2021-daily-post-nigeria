The Federal Government says the artisanal and small scale mining-lead processing plant sited in Ebonyi State, would commence operations in June 2021. The Minister of State for Mines and Steel, Dr Uchechukwu Ogah, disclosed this at Egu-Ogwu village of Ohaozara Local Government Area while inspecting the plant’s site donated to the Federal Government by the state government. Ogah said that the project would serve the entire South-East zone. “This is one of the President Muhammdu Buhari administration’s policies of ensuring that artisanal miners have a place in the Nigerian society, “he said. According to Ogah, jobs were already being created by the project by the clearing of the site and more is expected during the construction work and completion of the project. “The jobs to be created with the project would be in hundreds as the nation’s mining system is characterised by the activities of artisanal miners. The State Governor, David Umahi, applauded the Minister for the successes he recorded as a young entrepreneur with vast business interests.
Umahi said he agrees totally that President Buhari is committed to the development of the South-East zone.” The Chairman of South East Governor’s Forum, SEGF, further urged the minister to expedite action on the proposal from the state to his ministry on the president’s initiative to harness the huge salt and limestone granules potentials of the Ebonyi.
