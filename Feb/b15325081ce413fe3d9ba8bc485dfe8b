Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has warned some players in his squad who believe they are bigger than the club. Ahead of Sunday’s Premier League clash against West Brom, Solskjaer has told such players to find new clubs. Referring to his experience as a player with United, he told VG: “As a super-sub, as I was called a lot, I helped us win the extra points that helped us not to be number two, but league champion. “I try to make everyone on my team understand that they are involved and contribute in their own way. Then, there are some, who want to be the big fish in a small pond. Then maybe it’s time to go. United go into the game third on the log with 45 points, eight behind leaders Manchester City.
