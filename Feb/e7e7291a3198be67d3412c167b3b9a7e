The House of Representatives has asked the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to increase safety standards at recreational centers in the FCT. The resolution was sequel to a motion moved by Kabir Idris on Wednesday during plenary. Idris, in his motion, noted that such safety measures will prevent preventable deaths such as the one that claimed the life of 10 years old, Master Khalifah Suleiman at an amusement park in the FCT. According to Idris, Suleiman died due to non-compliance with safety measures by the operators of the park. He disclosed that “Suleiman’s death could have been avoidable if the instructors had ensured that he wore a protective helmet before getting on the Go-Karting with the seat belt fastened.” Reacting to the motion, the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila expressed sadness at the tragic death of the young man. The motion was taken with an amendment to extend the scope of the safety standards to all government establishments.
