The Speaker, Zamfara State House of Assembly, Hon Nasiru Mu’azu Magarya, at the plenary on Tuesday, expressed concern over the unnecessary delay in compiling different reports submitted to some committees for onward deliberations and subsequent recommendations at the floor of the House. The Speaker specifically called on chairmen of the committees whose reports await prompt action of the House to submit their reports without any further delay. Hon. Magarya warned that his leadership would not condole laxity, indolence or nonchalant attitude to duty, calling on his colleagues that are in such habits to desist from doing so for the overall benefit of the sixth Assembly that has excelled in legislative duties and engagements since the inception of the fourth republic to date. However, two executive bills, which include a bill for a law to provide for the administration of criminal justice system in the courts of the state and for other related matters 2021, as well as a bill for a law to establish penal code law of the state to penalised crimes established under the law 2021 scaled to second reading after positive contributions and debate by the members. The members in their separate contributions said there was a need to pass these two bills into law to deal squarely on the menace of banditry and insurgency affecting people of the state. After careful deliberations on the two bills before the House for considerations, Speaker Magarya ordered the Clerk of the House, Shehu Saidu Anka to give the two bills second reading and send same to the Committee on Law, Justice and judiciary to submit report to the House in three weeks and one month, respectively. The House before adjournment, considered a bill for a law to provide for the establishment and management of the state directorate for humanitarian affairs, disaster management and social development and other matters connected therewith 2021 and gave the bill first reading. Thereafter, the Speaker directs Hon Shafi’u Dama Wanke member representing Gusau 2 to adjourn today’s plenary till tomorrow, Wednesday by 10:00 am.
