Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has revealed that midfielder, Paul Pogba, would be back from injury in a few weeks’ time. Solskjaer said this on Monday at his pre-match press conference ahead of Man United’s FA Cup fifth-round tie with West Ham United on Tuesday night at Old Trafford. Pogba sustained a thigh-muscle injury during Man United’s 3-3 draw with Everton in the Premier League over the weekend. The France World Cup winner will miss Tuesday’s FA Cup clash with West Ham United, in addition to the Europa League ties against Real Sociedad. Providing an update on Pogba, Solskjaer told MUTV, “It’s an injury that will take a few weeks to heal. “He’s just started his recovery, working with the medical staff and we will get him back as soon and as safely as we can. “Of course, Paul has been very important for us and we are not going to take any risks. [So it is] A few weeks definitely. “You never want to be injured and, especially, now Paul was really finding his form and enjoying his football. For us, we just have to take as many points and wins as possible, when you lose players. “We have been very healthy and strong for a long period so we cannot moan too much.”
