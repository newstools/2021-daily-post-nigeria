Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh has reacted to a statement by the Nigeria Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC) disowning her appointment as a Peace Ambassador. Tonto had taken to Instagram informing her fans that she is now a “proud Nigeria Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC) Ambassador for Peace Building.” However, the NCPC in a statement said the information was false as the actress was not given any appointment. Responding, Tonto Dikeh insisted her disclosure of the appointment was not false. She disclosed that there are “video proofs” to confirm that she was appointed but that she would rather respect the Commission’s decision and take the fall. Her post read: “There are video proofs but I will rather take the fall and respect the commission decision. “Thanks to every Christian body that fought against this growth.”
