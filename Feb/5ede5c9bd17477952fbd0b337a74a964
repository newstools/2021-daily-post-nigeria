The Adamawa State Police Command has deployed more personnel to flashpoints of the state in a drive to ensure tighter security and have recovered two vehicles in two local government areas of the state. The Command made the disclosures on Monday in a statement issued by the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Nguroje. The statement specified that a Toyota Corolla car and a tricycle had been recovered as a direct result of the new deployments. ”The Adamawa State Police Command’s Rapid Response Squad (RRS) while on area patrol on 5/2/2020 along Gwalantabal and Ngurore in Song and Yola South local government areas sighted some criminal elements who attempted to kidnap their target but abandoned their vehicle and escaped arrest upon noticing policemen,” the statement explained. It added that the recovered tricycle was found abandoned at a criminal hideout along Ngurore. ”The police and other security agencies cannot fold their hands and watch hoodlums have a field day without taking steps to maintain law and order,” the Adamawa State Police Command stated.
”It was on that score that the state Commissioner of Police, Aliyu Adamu Alhaji, deployed additional personnel to beef up Operation Faruta and Rapid Response Squads, the state’s police operational squads, to provide watertight security within Yola metropolis and other parts of the state.
