Atletico Madrid manager, Diego Simeone, has said they will have a lot of work to do ahead of their second leg clash with Chelsea in the Champions League. The LaLiga side lost 1-0 to Thomas Tuchel’s side on Tuesday night. Olivier Giroud scored the only goal of the match in the second half. As a result, Simeone’s side will have it all to do at Stamford Bridge in three weeks, as they seek to qualify for the quarter-final. “Looking three weeks ahead is too far. We have a lot of games until then. We will be playing against an opponent with speed and will need to be able to stop it, to deal with forwards like Giroud and other powerful players. “We need to have more of the ball and position ourselves better in attack. We’ll work on it, but we also have an important game against Villarreal. “Work, work, work. I trust the team we have. If we were in the month of September and they told me we’ve lost but we’re still leading, I’d sign for it,” Simeone said.
