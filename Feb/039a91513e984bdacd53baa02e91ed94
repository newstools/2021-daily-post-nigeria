Manchester United will wait until the end of this season before opening contract talks with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the UK Sun reports. United is currently second in the Premier League, five points behind rivals and table-toppers Manchester City. They are also in the fifth round of the FA Cup, where they face West Ham and last-32 of the Europa League as well as Real Sociedad. It has been a fairly impressive season, but club chiefs want Solskjaer to keep up the title charge and secure Champions League football before they think about offering him a new contract. Solskjaer has 16 months left on his current deal and could be handed a new two-year contract, depending on how the season ends. Despite United sitting second in the league after the halfway stage, there are still question marks over Solskjaerâ€™s managerial credentials.
