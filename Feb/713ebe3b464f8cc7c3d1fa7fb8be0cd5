Manchester United are set to release three of their players this summer transfer window, according to Manchester Evening News. The three players are Sergio Romero, Joel Pereira and Paul Woolston. Man United are frittering more than £600,000 a week on the goalkeepers’ salary, but the three players are expected to leave the club in the summer. The Red Devils have no intention to trigger the one-year extension in Romero and Pereira’s contracts, while Woolston, popular Under-23 goalkeeper, is due to be let go after spending two-and-a-half years with the second string. Romero has not played all season and is fifth-choice behind David de Gea, Dean Henderson, Lee Grant and Nathan Bishop. The 33-year-old was unable to engineer a transfer in either of the last two windows and is now deserted at Old Trafford until the end of the season. Pereira, on the other hand, has played once in the Championship for Huddersfield. The 24-year-old has not appeared for Man United in more than three years.
