The Ooni of Ife, Adeyeye Ogunwusi Ojaja II, has charged the Federal and state governments to direct economic policies and other laudable programmes at the citizenry. Ogunwusi, who is the Co-Chairman of National Council of Traditional Rulers of Nigeria (NCTRN) urged the government to do more for the Nigerian masses by using cultural tourism as a veritable means for economic revolution.  As a country, Ooni said that wealth must go round, especially to the poor and other vulnerable members of the society, saying, “we cannot keep having strikingly rich few Nigerians and uncountable ones wallowing in abject poverty.” “The government must look at cultural tourism as a veritable tool for revolutionizing the economy before it’s too late”, Ooni said. He said this during the 2021 edition of the annual celebration of Aje Festival at his Ile-Oodua palace, on Monday.  The monarch lauded the Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government over several economic programmes and policies like the recent employment of 774,000 Nigerians across the country. Coordinator of the annual Aje Festival, Princess (Dr) Oluwatoyin Kolade expressed happiness for the massive turnout of participants from within and outside Nigeria. “My father, the Ooni is loaded with productive dynamism and great innovations for our race and African continent as a whole, especially in the area of cultural tourism revolution,” she added.
