Terrorists who fled a military operation in Sambisa forest and surrounding areas have attacked locals in Yobe State. The insurgents stormed Bayamari village on Tuesday. They killed seven villagers and four policemen who were trying to protect the people. The surprise attack on the agrarian community was launched around 12:15pm, an intelligence officer told PRNigeria. The source said the terrorists hit from their new camps in Malari Zango River Forest, Abduri, Buhari, Degaltura, Kayidiri, Garin Liman, Gumsari Gagala, and Gorrgo villages. The locations are all within Yunusari Local Government. “Insurgents have been fleeing Bama, Gwoza, Damboa and the Lake Chad axis where there are ongoing military operations and relocating to some villages to seek permanent refuge. “Sometimes, the terrorists disguise themselves into community members, rent houses, pretending to be businessmen. “Those who could not hide their identities establish camps and build makeshift tents like at Amadukaramdi, among other places,” the officer added.
