Former Italy international, Antonio Cassano has said Juventus made a mistake by signing Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo joined Juventus in 2018 with the aim of helping the Serie A champions to win the Champions League. The Portuguese superstar has, however, ended up winning the league title back to back while the dream of Champions League glory in Italy remains unfulfilled. And Cassano feels Juve erred in signing the five-time Ballon d’Or winner from Real Madrid. “Juventus signed him to win the Champions League, but they’ve done worse with him than they’ve done before,” Cassano said to Corriere dello Sport. “They would have won the Scudetto [Serie A title] without him. It was the wrong project. “He’ll keep scoring goals because he knows how to do that no matter what. “I think he will have done badly unless they manage to win the Champions League.”
