The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, on Saturday, said that the Federal Government won’t pay ransom to secure the release of the abducted students and members of staff of Government Science College, Kagara, Niger State. The Information Minister made this known during an interview on Channels Television’s ‘Sunrise Daily’. Mohammed said that the Federal Government was only out to employ kinetic and non-kinetic (measures) to secure the release of the kidnapped victims. He further revealed that the government won’t tolerate any form of criminality in the country. “Bandits all over the world work with the psychology of people. Deliberately, they target women and children because this is what will attract a lot of global outcries.‌ “Criminality in any form will not be tolerated by the government. At the same time, the government has a duty to look at the underlining causes of some of these criminalities in order to address them. “Also, the government won’t be paying ransom to secure their release. All I can tell you is that, as at today, the government is on top of the matter. We are mapping out other roots that can be used to ensure they come back safely,” he said.
