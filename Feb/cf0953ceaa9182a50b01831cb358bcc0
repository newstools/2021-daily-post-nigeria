Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger, has taken a thinly-veiled swipe at a former manager, Frank Lampard and hailing his replacement Thomas Tuchel, as a coach “who knows what he wants”. Tuchel remains unbeaten as the Blues boss ahead of their FA Cup clash with Barnsley on Thursday. After a 0-0 draw with Wolves in his first match, Tuchel has guided Chelsea to wins over Burnley, Tottenham and Sheffield United. Rudiger had been frozen out by Lampard at the start of the season and he was recently forced to shoot down rumours that he played a part in his sack. But he has praised the new manager’s instant impact. “The most important impression he’s made is that he knows what he wants,” Rudiger told Sky Germany when speaking about Tuchel. “He has his way of playing football, which is positive for many players. This is also reflected in the latest results. This has been a good, positive start for him.”
