The Federal Government has said the the COVID-19 vaccine is not meant to kill Africans as speculated by many. Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha said this on Tuesday at the inauguration of the State House Clinic Special Care Centre (COVID-19 Isolation Centre), Abuja. Mustapha dismissed the conspiracy theory surrounding the vaccine, stressing that no country was interested in spending money just to kill Africans. The SGF said the FG would continue to sensitize Nigerians on the benefit of been vaccinated against the dreaded virus. He stressed that absence of the vaccine may deny Nigerians from traveling outside the country. Recall that Nigerians, especially some religious leaders have kicked against the vaccine, saying there were other motives behind its production. Recall also that the former senator representing Kogi West Senatorial District, had in a video urged Nigerians to steer clear of the vaccine, maintaining that the speed at which the vaccine is being produced remains suspicious.
