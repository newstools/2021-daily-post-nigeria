Critical Stakeholders of Ugondo community, Makurdi Local Government Area of Benue State have condemned acts of lawlessness exhibited by hoodlums purportedly protesting the erection of perimeter fence by Nigerian Air Force at the Air Force Base, Makurdi. Arising from an emergency meeting on Tuesday, at the Makurdi residence of Senator Fred Orti, the Stakeholders condemned, in very strong terms, the actions of the hoodlums describing same as barbaric, evil, criminal and self-seeking as neither the hoodlums nor their acts represent the interest of Ugondo community. The stakeholders, in a communiqué sent to DAILY POST, urged those involved and benefitting from the crisis to desist forthwith or be made to face the full wrath of the law. They further lauded the steps taken by the State Governor, Samuel Ortom towards amicable resolution of the dispute between Ugondo community and the Nigerian Air Force and charged him never to be deterred by acts of sabotage but remain focused in his resolve to provide good governance to the people as well as protection of lives and property of the citizenry. The communiqué was signed by His Royal Highness Clement Kurugh for the Traditional Institution, Senator Fred Orti, on behalf of Ugondo Elders and Comrade Ternenge Azande on behalf of Ugondo Development Association. The Ugondo Community pledged their unalloyed support to Ortom and his cardinal objectives of fairness, equity, and justice in piloting State affairs and called on her members to remain law-abiding and peaceful in expressing their grievances over the land dispute between the community and Nigerian Air Force.
