A farmer, identified as Dele Olowoniyi, has been slaughtered by some suspected Fulani herdsmen at Oha village, Imeko-Afon Local Government area of Ogun State. DAILY POST reports that the incident occurred around 1:30am on Sunday. This is coming a few hours after Governor Dapo Abiodun said he has ordered the deployment of security agents to Imeko and other border communities in Yewa. Our correspondent gathered that Oha village was attacked at night by the killers of the farmer. “The Fulani herdsmen invaded the community with three motorbikes. They were nine in number – three on each bike,” the Balogun of Imeko Isale, Chief Ganiu Akinleye confirmed to DAILY POST. Akinleye spoke further that, “When they entered the village, they started shooting into the air. The deceased farmer, who was asleep outside his hut was captured and slaughtered. “Immediately they killed him, they left the village. “It was the wife who called the Baale. The Baale was in Imeko that time. At daybreak, he went to Oha and met the corpse of the slain farmer. The Baale came to me with the wife and I led them to the Kabiyesi. The case was later reported at the police station,” Akinleye told DAILY POST in a telephone interview. The Balogun disclosed that Olowoniyi, whose age he said should be around 50, left behind a wife and three children. According to him, the incident was a rude shock to the people of Imeko, saying “we can no longer fold our arms and watch Fulani kill our people, the appropriate steps will be taken.” It was gathered that the corpse of the deceased has been taken to the Federal Medical Centre, (FMC), Idi-Aba, Abeokuta, for autopsy. Contacted, the Ogun Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said he has not been briefed about the incident, promising to find out.
