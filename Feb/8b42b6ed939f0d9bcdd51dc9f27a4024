Nigerian troops on Friday evening repelled attacks by Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) on a base in Borno State. The sect members stormed areas in Dikwa and then went after troops firing sporadically. An intelligence source told PRNigeria that the terrorists invaded a military Super Camp unit on the northern axis of the town. They arrived on motorcycles and several light trucks mounted with Heavy Machine Guns (HMGs). The fighters approached the base from two routes, the source disclosed. “One of the groups attacked from the northern axis towards Marte road, while the other group approached the base from the north-eastern axis towards Gajibo road. “The troops on the ground had got a signal of the attempted invasion and retreated to Ajiri community in the Southern axis, where they relaunched counter-attacks with troops from Gulumba. “A Ground Force Close Air Support (CAS) component deployed also attacked the terrorists from the air destroying their gun trucks and makeshift camps.” Recently, terrorists launched an assault from a new base in Andakar using some commanders and mercenaries from neighbouring countries. After the latest ISWAP attack, troops nabbed two men suspected to be their informants. The civilians, both resident of Dikwa, are under investigation.
