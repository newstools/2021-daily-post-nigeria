The newly-appointed Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has reacted to her appointment as WTO Director-General. Okonjo-Iweala in a tweet via her handle on Monday said the organisation would get the global economy running again during her tenure as the WTO DG. She also expressed willingness to make the WTO stronger, adding that the organisation would adapt to realities of the day. “I am totally honoured to have been selected by WTO members as WTO Director-General. “A strong WTO is vital if we are to recover fully and rapidly from the devastation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. “I look forward to working with members to shape and implement the policy responses we need to get the global economy going again. “Our organization faces a great many challenges but working together we can collectively make the WTO stronger, more agile and better adapted to the realities of today,” she said.
