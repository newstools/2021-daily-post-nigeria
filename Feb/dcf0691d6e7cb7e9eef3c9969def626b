Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has said that midfielder, Thomas Partey, will not feature for the Gunners when they take on Benfica in the Europa League round of 32 clash at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome on Thursday night due to injury. Arteta said this at his pre-match press conference on Wednesday. The Spaniard said Partey is still working his way back from a thigh injury, adding that he didn’t travel to Italy for the Benfica clash. Partey missed Arsenal’s 4-2 victory over Leeds United last Sunday. “Thomas didn’t travel,” Arteta said. “He’s not there yet, he’s still training individually.” Partey will also miss Arsenal’s Premier League clash against Manchester City on Sunday. The Ghanaian international might be fit for the return leg with Benfica next week Thursday. The kick-off time for Benfica vs Arsenal is 9 pm.
