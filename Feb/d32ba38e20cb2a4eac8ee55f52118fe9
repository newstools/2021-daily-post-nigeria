Former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, on Saturday shared a picture of himself and Femi Adesina, the spokesperson of President Muhammadu Buhari at the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport in Abuja. However, Fani-Kayode did not provide details as to if he was flying in or out of the nation’s capital. Adesina and Fani-Kayode have clashed severally over the former Minister’s scathing remarks about Buhari. However, Fani-Kayode described Adesina as his “old friend” and joked he was “now in trouble”. He wrote: “Was delighted to have bumped into my old friend and brother Pastor Femi Adesina, Special Advisor to President Buhari on Media & Publicity at Abuja airport this morning! “Oh dear! Now I am really in trouble! It was a pleasure to see Femi again after a number of years!” Fani-Kayode has been in the news all week, over his purported attempt to decamp to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).
