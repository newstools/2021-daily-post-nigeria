A lawmaker, Tomide Akinribido, has reacted to the outburst by the All Progressives Congress (APC) pioneer chairman, Bisi Akande. The member of the Ondo State House of Assembly predicted a dirty fight in ruling All Progressives (APC). Akinribido of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) represents Ondo West Constituency 1. “Chief Bisi Akande has exposed a deep crack and the possibility of an impending dirty fight that will occur soon”, he tweeted. On Wednesday, Akande condemned the ongoing APC membership registration and revalidation exercise. The former Osun Governor described it as wasteful at a time the nation’s economy was on the downturn. “No population census is repeated within less than a decade and that voters are not re-registered at every election. “I see the present APC membership registration within less than a decade after the original register as an indefensible aberration leading to certain ugly perceptions”, he said. Akande also criticised the “abnormal” constitution of the National Caretaker Committee constituted by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2020.
