Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has admitted that the club “offered a lot of money” to land Jamie Vardy in 2016. However, Vardy eventually decided to stay with Leicester City. The England striker became one of the most sought after players in England, after he fired the Foxes to the Premier League title. One of his admirers was Arsenal. When asked on beIN Sports how close he came to signing Vardy, Wenger said: “I offered him a lot of money at the time. “Leicester had just won the championship in 2016, and [Vichai] Srivaddhanaprabha at the time, who unfortunately after had the helicopter accident, did absolutely not want to lose him and they offered him a longer contract and approximately the same money, if not more.”
