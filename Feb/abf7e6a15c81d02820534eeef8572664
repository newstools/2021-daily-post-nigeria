The Nigerian military has arrested a Civilian JTF member, Umar Muhammed accused of sharing fake information on the killing of soldiers in Borno by Boko Haram. The 29-year-old claimed that the terrorist killed five soldiers and abducted many others. He alleged that the incident occurred when workers were repairing an electricity facility along Maiduguri-Damaturu road on Monday. Muhammed, a Civilian JTF member at Shehuri-North in Maiduguri Metropolitan Council, was arrested at his residence by security operatives. The military is furious that the suspect publicized falsehood despite knowing such could cause panic. “This kind of fake news can create a false impression among citizens. From the suspect’s post, it is clear that the idea behind it was to sabotage military efforts”, a security source said. During the preliminary investigation, Muhammed claimed his account was hacked by anonymous persons. Deputy Director, Army Public Relations, Ado Isa, in a statement, described the report as misleading. “Nobody was attacked on Monday, as the road was cleared for the maiden visitation of the COAS, who came to see the troops of Special Army Super Camp, Ngamdu. “No repair work was carried out on the TCN facility, as the workers were asked not to go. Our troops who were supposed to provide them with escort were busy preparing for the COAS visit”, the Colonel noted.
