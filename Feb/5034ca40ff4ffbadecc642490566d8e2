Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said that he would be remembered in the club’s history for good reasons and not for bad. Mourinho said this while rubbishing rumours about his future at Tottenham. Speculation about Mourinho’s future increased last Sunday as Tottenham slipped to ninth position on the Premier League table following a 2-1 defeat at West Ham. But the former Chelsea, Manchester United, Inter Milan, and Real Madrid head coach is now confident that he will turn the situation around. Speaking at his press conference on Tuesday ahead of Tottenham’s Europa League last-32 second-leg tie against Wolfsberger on Wednesday night, Mourinho said, “I believe that we will win through and that I will be in Tottenham’s history for the good reasons and not for the bad reasons. “I would like to know which coach has always had blue sky and never cloudy or a bit dark. “Perhaps only a coach who is always at a dominant club in a league. It shows how beautiful my career has been. “I want to give happiness to everyone, the chairman, the players, the fans, everybody connected to the club. “I feel one of them, and I want to give happiness to them.”
