Brendan Rodgers has reacted to Leicester City’s 3-1 defeat to Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday. Leicester took the lead early at the King Power Stadium after Youri Tielemans fired the home side ahead with a clinical finish after some poor defending from Arsenal. But goals from David Luiz, Alexandre Lacazette’s penalty and Nicolas Pepe ensured that Mikel Arteta’s went home with all 3 points. Speaking on his team’s performance, Rodgers told a post-match press conference, “I credit the players. We’ve got a number of injuries, we’ve had injuries in the game. “But the spirit and the mentality… they keep going, they keep fighting and that’s what we’ll do right until the very end of the season.” Asked what he would have changed about the game, Rodgers replied: “The score! “Probably the score and having our injured players back but you can’t do that so we will fight on. “Like I said, it’s a tough time for us with injuries and it ends a run in the Premier League which has been really good. “But will get back in tomorrow. We have the perfect opportunity on Wednesday to respond and that’s what we’ll look to do.”
