Aisha Yesufu, a popular Nigerian activist has called for a march to the Aso Villa in demand for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari. Aisha made the call while reacting to the recent abduction of about 300 schoolgirls from Zamfara Government Secondary School, Jangebe, by suspected armed bandits. The Zamfara Commissioner of Security and Home Affairs, Alhaji Abubakar Dauran while confirming the abduction told newsmen that the abductors in their hundreds invaded the town and took away the students at about 2am on Friday morning. According to Aisha, the government has emboldened terrorists to continue kidnapping and has resigned from its responsibilities to protect the lives of Nigerians. She urged Nigerians to put aside their differences and come together to march to the Villa in demand for Buhari’s resignation. On her Twitter page, Aisha wrote: “Terrorists have been emboldened to keep attacking and abducting. Government has been enabled to keep abdicating its responsibilities. “When we are sick and tired of the atrocities, we will forget our differences and go en masse to the Villa and demand Buhari resigns. “
