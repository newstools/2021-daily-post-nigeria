Former Arsenal midfielder, Robert Pires, has predicted Aaron Ramsey will return to Emirates Stadium from Juventus in the near future. Ramsey left as a free agent in the summer of 2019. Since his departure, the Wales international has made 55 appearances for the Italian giants and helped them to Serie A and Supercoppa glory. He is tied to a contract through to the summer of 2023, by which time he will be 32 years of age. But Pires can see the Welshman heading back to Arsenal for a second stint. Pires has told TuttoJuve: “He is very intelligent and knows how to adapt everywhere, Juve is a very big club and Serie A is improving him even more. “He needs to stay a few more years and then he will return to Arsenal. “It is my belief; I am not a fortune teller.”
