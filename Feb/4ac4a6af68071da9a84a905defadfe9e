The Police have raided some areas on the Lagos Island. Public Relations Officer, CSP Muyiwa Adejobi, in a statement, on Tuesday, said the operation was part of efforts to restore normalcy to the locations. He noted that Agarawu, Ita Faaji, Igbosere and others have been under the siege of miscreants and gangsters. A combined team of RRS, Taskforce, Police Mobile Force, Lagos State Neighborhood Safety Corps and local security outfits made the arrests. Adejobi said ACP Bode Ojajuni, the Area Commander Area A, Lion Building, went after “the bad boys in the areas which eventually led to the arrest of 58 suspects”. The Police said those in custody, 53 male and 5 female, allegedly attacked and damaged people’s property on different occasions. The spokesman said their actions caused loss of lives. Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has directed that the suspects be transferred to the Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Yaba, for investigation and prosecution.
