About 15 students of the Osun State School of Nursing and Midwifery, Osogbo have tested positive for COVID-19. Sources told DAILY POST that a student in the school hostel, last week tested positive for the virus. The development compelled the management of the school to mandate a compulsory COVID-19 test for all students. Our correspondent gathered that, over the weekend, about five students were discharged from the Isolation centre. However, some students are still expecting their COVID-19 result while those who have tested positive have been moved to the Isolation centre, another source confirmed to our reporter. The Osun State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu confirmed the news that some students tested positive for the virus within the school. Though he confirmed the news, Isamotu declined giving the actual figures of patients. He said, “Just like anybody else, a few students tested positive. So, it is normal. Few students tested positive, not many. I can assure you.” The State Government, however, had called on residents of the state, especially those with traits of sickness, to go for COVID-19 test as the number of coronavirus cases in the state increased.
