The Federal Government has said it is working hard to curtail spread of the dreaded coronavirus (COVID-19) in the country by procuring certified vaccine. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said this while speaking on a radio programme on Sunday in Lagos. According to the minister, arrangements had been concluded to get millions of vaccine doses to protect citizens against the virus. “Yes, we are doing our best. By the end of the month, we are expecting 16 million AstraZeneca vaccines, out of the 41 million doses promised by WHO under the CAVAX arrangement. “On our own, we have paid for 43 million vaccines doses including AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. So that will arrive later. So, we are doing our best. “I want to urge Nigerians to avail themselves of the vaccines when they arrive. All the negative and untrue things that people say about the vaccines will not help,” he said. DAILY POST reports that the country currently has a total of 151,553 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 1,831 fatalities and 128,005 recoveries.
