Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, on Friday met Oyo Governor, Seyi Makinde. The parley was a follow-up to the one he had with former Ekiti Governor, Ayo Fayose. Saraki disclosed that the meetings were part of efforts to understand issues causing disaffection as the PDP seeks to strengthen its fold. The former Kwara Governor is the Chairman of the party’s Reconciliation and Strategy Committee. “As part of our ongoing efforts to reconcile the leaders and members of our great party, last week, I had a meeting with the former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose”, he said. “As a follow-up to that engagement and consultation, this evening, I just wrapped up an extensive but fruitful meeting with Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State. “As we continue to listen to and learn about the concerns of stakeholders of our party, it is great to observe their willingness to work towards forging a stronger and more united Peoples Democratic Party.”
