Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has named a new position Kai Havertz will feature importantly in his squad this season. Tuchel also insisted that Havertz’s lack of playing time over the course of the last month has simply been down to his lack of fitness. The former PSG manager, who has largely opted for a 3-5-2 formation since taking over from Frank Lampard last January, said the 21-year-old would play the number 9 or 10 role because he is very comfortable in high positions. “Since I have arrived, the only thing that kept Kai Havertz from making a big impact is his injury, nothing else,” Chelsea’s official website quoted Tuchel as saying ahead of the Blues’ clash with Manchester United on Sunday. “He is a unique player. It is not so clear where he needs to settle. Does he need to settle on one special position? Or is he kind of a hybrid player? Today, I would say he’s in between a nine and a 10, something in between. “He is very comfortable in the box; he’s very comfortable in high positions, he’s very good at offensive headers, he has good timing to arrive in the box, good finishing, good composure in the box, around the box, and very comfortable in high positions so between nine and 10.”
