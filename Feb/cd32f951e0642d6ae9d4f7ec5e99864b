Senate President, Ahmad Lawan on Tuesday, said the legislature was limited in powers to address insecurity in the country. Lawan said while debating on a bill entitled: “The Firearms Act CAP F28 LFN 2004 (Amendment) Bill, 2021”, sponsored by Senator Uba Sani, representing Kaduna Central. According to the Senate President, only the executive has the power to address the issue of insecurity ravaging the entire country currently. According to Lawan, “For us in the National Assembly, it has been a very difficult time, probably the most difficult, because our people face these daily security challenges. “The question is always ‘what are you people doing?’ “And unfortunately, the legislature is limited in what it can do. “It cannot implement but it can talk about it, discuss it, debate it and insist on it. “I believe that this executive is ready to do something to improve the security situation and now that we are seeing a different and improved approach maybe the end to insecurity in the country is on sight. “Recently, we have seen the National Security Adviser working with the Service Chiefs and others in a coordinated manner. “We pray that this is sustained and that for us we will give them every possible support.”
