The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Buba Marwa, has assured that his leadership will not spare anyone no matter how long they have been in the trade of illicit drugs. Marwa made this known in an interactive session with religious leaders and the road transport union officials in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. He pleaded with them to take the sensitization against the use of illicit drugs and narcotics to their congregations, followers and union members. He also urged the NURTW leaders to mobilize their members against using drugs and transporting same for traffickers. “We need to secure our country from the menace of drug abuse by working together. For us in the new NDLEA, this is a fight to finish. “We can’t allow this country to be destroyed by criminalities. All those involved in this criminal act must be fished out and punished. “Nobody in his right sense will take up arms to kidnap, rape and kill innocent people. Therefore, if we are able to tackle the issue of drug abuse, most of the security challenges the nation is facing now would have been solved. “We also need to take this war as a battle to save our children and women, and ultimately our society and the country at large,” he said. On their part, the various religious bodies pledged their support in the renewed fight against drug menace in Rivers state in particular and the country at large. They said they were happy to be part of the meeting and given Marwa’s antecedents, they were excited about the record seizures and arrests made since he took over the leadership of the Agency about a month ago.
