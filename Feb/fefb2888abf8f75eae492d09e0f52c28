Chelsea will not win the English Premier League title with Olivier Giroud and Tammy Abraham as their two centre forwards. This claim was made by Arsenal hero, Paul Merson. Merson said this ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League home clash against Manchester United on Sunday evening at Stamford Bridge. “I have said all along that Chelsea are set up for three at the back. But it’s going to take a bit of time to get it right,” Merson wrote in his column for Daily Star. “And they are not going to win the league with Olivier Giroud and Tammy Abraham as their two centre forwards.” Chelsea are currently in the fifth position on the EPL log with 43 points after 25 games. The Blues have not lost a game since Thomas Tuchel took over from Frank Lampard last January. They have won six out of their last eight games.
