No fewer than four persons have been reportedly killed by suspected killer herdsmen on Sunday evening at Agbon-Ojodu, Yewa North Local Government area of Ogun State. On Friday, herdsmen were said to have attacked Ebute Igbooro, killing four and setting properties on fire. This was after about six persons were hacked to death and some thrown into a river in Owode Ketu on Thursday. DAILY POST reports that the latest Sunday attack came a few hours after a delegation of the Ogun State Government left the area. The delegation, led by the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Hon Afolabi Afuape and his Information counterpart, Waheed Odusile, were in the troubled areas, in company of the state Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, promising to secure lives and property. However, the visit, it was gathered, did not deter the attackers from wreaking another havoc on residents of Agbon and Asa, killing, maiming and burning houses. They reportedly invaded the areas in the evening, setting ablaze some houses and killing four villagers. A member of the Ogun State House of Assembly representing the area, Hon. Haruna Egungbohun, has confirmed the incident. Egungbohun said, “Fulani herdsmen killed 4 people along Agbon road immediately the Commissioner of Police, Commissioner for Local Governments and Commissioner for Information left the area.” According to him, people ran helter-skelter to avoid being killed by the brutal killer herdsmen. Meanwhile, the Eselu of Iselu, Oba Akintunde Akinyemi, who also confirmed the incident, sounded a note of warning that if the killings of his people did not stop, he might lead an attack against the criminals. ‌Ogun Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, could not be reached for reactions at the moment.
