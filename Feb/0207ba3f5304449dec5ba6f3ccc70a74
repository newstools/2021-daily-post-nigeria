The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has warned motorists and other road users to desist from indulging in drunk-driving, excessive speed, and reckless driving while celebrating the 2021 Valentine’s Day. The Corps Public Education Officer (CPEO), Assistant Corps Marshal (ACM) Bisi Kazeem, who issued the warning in a statement on Saturday said this was to ensure safe and crash-free celebration during the period. He said that it was also a way to mitigate all incidences of road traffic crashes during the time. He said that the Corps Marshal, FRSC, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, had directed Commanding Officers across board to double their efforts by ensuring massive deployment of officers and men. This, he said, was for enhanced visibility, adequate traffic control, and maximum enforcement of all COVID-19 protocols amongst motorists. According to Kazeem, all patrol operatives have been directed to go along with breathalysers, and radar guns. “This is to ensure that suspected drunk drivers are tested and stopped from continuing their trips so as to avoid unnecessary deaths, injuries and damage to properties, ” he said. Kazeem quoted Oyeyemi as saying, that the Valentine’s celebration was a day set aside all over the world to celebrate love, exchange gifts, and show that we care for one another, in memory of Saint Valentine who exemplified love while he lived. He, however, reminded all those celebrating that it should be done in strict compliance with all COVID-19 protocols, including use of face mask and observing physical distancing inside vehicles.
