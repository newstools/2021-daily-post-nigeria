A federal high court in Abuja has ordered the Inspector General of Police IGP, Mohammed Adamu to appear before it on February 4 over his alleged continued disobedience to a lawful court order. The Police Chief whose summons has been served at the Force Headquarters in Abuja is to show cause in court why contempt charges should not be filed against him to commit him to prison. DAILY POST reports that Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu issued the summons against the IGP following the alleged refusal to reinstate a forcefully retired Deputy Commissioner of Police DCP Patrick Okoli. A federal high court had voided and set aside the forceful retirement of Okoli from the force on the ground that due process of law was not followed in the purported retirement. The court while ordering the reinstatement of DCP Okoli imposed a fine of N10m as punitive cost against police authorities. Following the order, the Police contested the high court judgment at the Court of Appeal but lost as the appellate court affirmed the decision of the lower court. In compliance with the Court of Appeal’s decision, DCP Okoli was reinstated via a letter and in another letter was again retired compulsorily by police authorities. However, Justice Ijeoma after listening to arguments canvassed by Mr Arinze Solomon Eggo, counsel to the applicant, issued an order directing the IGP to appear before her court on Thursday, February 4. “An order of this court is hereby made mandating the Inspector General of Police to appear before this court on the 4th day of February 2021 at 9am to show cause why a contempt proceeding should not be taken against the Inspector General of Police for refusal to obey the judgment of the Court in this matter which judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. “This summons shall be served forthwith,” the Justice said.
