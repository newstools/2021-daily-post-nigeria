Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has marked two years of surviving the helicopter crash that almost claimed his life in 2019. Recall that on the 2nd of February 2019, the Vice President and his team, 11 of them, narrowly escaped death after the helicopter they were travelling in for a political campaign, crashed in Kabba, Kogi state. The Vice President in a post via his Twitter account on Wednesday remembered the day as he thanked God for saving his life. He also said the day would have been remembered as a sorrowful day if not for God’s special intervention. “It would have been remembered as a day of sorrow because of the helicopter crash on February 2, 2019, involving me and eleven others. “But I am happy and we thank God that it turned out to be a day of victory and thanksgiving,” he wrote.
