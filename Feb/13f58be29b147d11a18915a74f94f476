West Ham United boss, David Moyes, has commented on Jesse Lingard’s performance after the attacking midfielder scored a goal in his side’s Premier League 2-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Moyes also hailed Tottenham manager, Jose Mourinho, as one of the top managers in football. The Scottish saw West Ham defeat Spurs at the London Stadium following goals from Michail Antonio and Jesse Lingard as Lucas Moura’s strike was not enough to give Mourinho’s men a point. Speaking after the game, Moyes told a post-match press conference: “Jesse has been a very good player. We should not take that away. He has had a difficult year. He has given us something else and helped us get better. “There is always a first for everything, and Jose Mourinho has had great teams. He is up there with elite managers, but sometimes football can get you results like it did today.” He added, “We have only done half a job. If we continue this way, we’ll be close. I do not want to be negative in any way. “We’re enjoying it but are also not going to be daft. We will keep calm and hopefully keep pushing the teams at the top.”
