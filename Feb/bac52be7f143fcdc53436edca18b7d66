Manchester United have been handed a significant injury boost ahead of their Premier League clash with West Brom on Sunday. Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, confirmed that defender, Eric Bailly, has returned to the club’s training ahead of the West Brom clash at Hawthorns. Bailly has not played for Man United since the 2-1 win at Fulham last month due to injury. The Ivory Coast centre-back also missed Man United’s FA Cup 1-0 win over West Ham on Tuesday. “Eric has been training, so that’s a boost to us, “Solskjaer was quoted by Man United’s official website as saying at his pre-match press conference on Friday. “Eric is available. He has trained for a couple of days so he will be available for selection. So that’s a positive. “Apart from that, no-one else is back.” The kick-off time for West Brom vs Man United is 3 pm.
