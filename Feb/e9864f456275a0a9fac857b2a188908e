The command’s spokesman, Ahmed Mohammed Wakil, denied the rumours in a press release he signed and made available to DAILY POST, declaring that they are nothing but “imaginative creation by mischievous elements”. Wakil, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) reassured the people of the state the police are a highly professional force whose operations are clearly defined and carried out through well specified official channels. While calling on the people to ignore the rumours, DSP Wakil added that the command would keep them well informed of developments relating to their safety and security. “The attention of the Bauchi State Police Command has been drawn to reports making the rounds, especially on social media that the Bauchi State Police Commissioner, CP Lawan Tanko Jimeta, has purportedly been transferred from Bauchi to Kano State. “The Command therefore wishes to make it categorically clear that there has been no recent development to that effect in the Police Force and CP Jimeta still remains fully in charge of Bauchi State. “The rumours are nothing but imaginative creation by mischievous elements as a means to achieve their own ulterior motives. “We, therefore, call on the general public to ignore such gossips, while going about their normal businesses. “We also wish to reassure the citizens that the Nigerian Police is a highly professional force whose operations are clearly defined and carried out through well specified official channels that will always in turn be relayed to the general public through authorised persons. Anything short of this remains what it is – a grapevine. “The Bauchi State Police Command will always keep the people well informed and abreast of developments as it relates to their safety and security,” the police spokesman stated.
