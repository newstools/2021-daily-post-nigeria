Chelsea forward, Timo Werner, has admitted that he has been humbled by the difficulties he has had to face at the club since joining last summer. The German admitted that his struggles at Stamford Bridge have brought him down to earth. Werner said he can no longer be considered a “super striker”. The forward joined Chelsea from RB Leipzig for a fee of £47.5 which means that much was expected of him but he has so far failed to live up to that hefty price tag. The Germany international knows he has fallen short of expectations in his first few months with the Blues. “At the beginning, I had this self-image that I can go on doing my thing here, but in the last few months I have been brought down to earth. It’s the way in England that you never have a quiet game,” he told Kicker. “The players are 1.9 meters tall, brutal physically and really fast – including the defenders. It’s impressive what intensity is going on in the Premier League.”
