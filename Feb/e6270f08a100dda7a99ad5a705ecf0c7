Security operatives in Adamawa State have gunned down two robbery suspects following a shootout between the operatives and the suspects. Men and officials of the Nigeria Police as well as members of vigilante and hunters groups took part in the offensive against the men of the underworld, leading to two deaths and arrest of one person while others fled. The suspects were said to have been terrorizing travelers on the Adamawa State stretch of the busy Numan-Jalingo highway. According to the State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Suleiman Nguroje, the operation that resulted in the gunning down of the two robbery suspects was carried out about 12.03hrs of Monday, February 1, on the order of the Commissioner of Police, Aliyu Adamu, after someone reported the activity of the suspects. Nguroje said in a statement that the operation led by the DPO in charge of Numan Division of the Nigeria Police, led to the arrest of Ashidu Balari of Lafia town in Lamurde Local Government Area, as well as the recovery of Dane guns, knives, cutlasses and charms. “The suspect (Ashidu Balari) who is now receiving treatment is being investigated in connection with criminal conspiracy and armed robbery,” Nguroje said. He added that the Command has commended the Police operatives of Numan Division for their immediate response which resulted in the successes recorded. “The CP, while appreciating the vigilantes/hunters in Numan for their cooperation and support so far calls for improved partnership and collaboration between the citizens and the Police, particularly in the areas of providing credible and actionable information to the Police which is required in tackling crimes and apprehending unrepentant criminals in the state,” Nguroje stated.
