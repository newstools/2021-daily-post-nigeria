President Muhammadu Buhari’s aide, Bashir Ahmad, has advised former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, not to join the All Progressives Congress (APC). On Wednesday, the presidential assistant on new media recalled how Fani-Kayode described the ruling party. “If I were him, I would never even think of joining the Almajiri People Congress”, he tweeted. But the ex-Minister says he remains in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “Though we have had meetings across party lines and we are in a season of political consultation I have not left the PDP”, he tweeted. In its reaction, Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) called Fani-Kayode a betrayer. The organization said he was defecting to the APC to campaign for Bola Tinubu. The former Lagos State Governor is reportedly interested in running for the 2023 presidency.
