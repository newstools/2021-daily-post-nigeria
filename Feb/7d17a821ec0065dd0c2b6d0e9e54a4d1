Napoli coach, Gennaro Gattuso, has urged his team to keep their heads up and look ahead following their 3-1 defeat to Atalanta in the Coppa Italia semi-final second leg on Wednesday night. Gattuso wants his players to recover on time and be in good condition ahead of their next match against Juventus in the Serie A on Saturday at Stadio San Paolo. Atalanta eliminated Napoli from the Coppa Italia, thanks to goals from Duván Zapata, Matteo Pessina and Matteo Pessina. Hirving Lozano did score a goal for Gattuso’s men at the Gewiss Stadium. Atalanta and Napoli had played a goalless draw in the first-leg last week. “We reacted well, another team could concede 4-5 goals tonight,” Gattuso was quoted by Napoli’s official website as saying. “At the beginning, they were clearly superior to them, we missed our goals and went down 2-0. At that point, we could have succumbed and instead we were good at reacting and getting back into the game. “In the second half we expressed ourselves well, we could even equalize, then in the final Atalanta scored the third goal. Now we need to keep our heads up and look ahead. We need to recover men and conditions and think about Juventus already.”
