The Lekki Phase 1 main gate will be shut this weekend due to the planned EndSARS protest. There are plans for and against the reopening of Lekki toll gate on Saturday. On Thursday, the leadership of Lekki Residents Association (LERA) said the main entrance will be closed. LERA Chairman, Yomi Idowu, made the announcement via a public notice. “Dear Residents, the main gate into Lekki Phase 1 shall be closed by 5:00 on Saturday 13th February, 2021, due to the impending protest at the Lekki toll gate. “Please plan to use alternative routes. All inconveniences are regretted. Please keep safe,”the information read. The federal government, Lagos authorities and the Police have warned against any form of demonstration. Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, said operatives would take positions against the protesters. Odumosu stressed that security of lives and property would be protected. “Organising any protest in furtherance of the recent violent and destructive EndSars protest will be counterproductive to the ongoing series of inquiries and investigations,” he noted.
