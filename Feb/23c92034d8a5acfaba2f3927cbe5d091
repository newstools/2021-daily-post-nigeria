Erwin, the brother of Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has revealed that he had to uncover a mole in the dressing room that was leaking his team’s selection. Koeman has endured a shaky start to life at the Nou Camp, with the Catalans still struggling to make an impact under him. And one of his early problems was to identify an enemy within the ranks. Erwin, who was assistant to his brother at Everton and Southampton, told Voetbal: “During the first months, someone from the locker room leaked the line-ups but Ronald solved it. “He has a certain tension, more than the one he had with the Dutch team because Barca is not like working with the national team once every three months. “He is totally focused on Barca. “And it’s the only thing he thinks about. We are in touch and we talk about the club, the players and the family. And sometimes I advise him.”
