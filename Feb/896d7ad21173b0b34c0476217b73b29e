Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger, has revealed one of the tactical differences between the club’s former manager, Frank Lampard and his replacement, Thomas Tuchel ahead of the Blues’ Premier League clash with Newcastle United on Monday night. Lampard spent a year and six months at the Stamford Bridge before being sacked and replaced by Tuchel last month. The Englishman was dismissed when Chelsea was in the ninth position on the Premier League table. Chelsea have enjoyed an upturn in results since Tuchel took over, with the West London club winning their last three matches to climb to the fifth position on the log. However, Rudiger believes Tuchel knows what he wants from Chelsea players and says he differs from Lampard in how he wants the club to win the ball back. “Because of the results, it’s been good [under Tuchel so far],” Rudiger told Sky Sports. “I think the coach knows what he wants. He has a way of playing football, and you can see from the games, the players have adapted very quickly to that. “From every coach, you want him to improve you. I do not want to hear what I am doing good. I want to hear what I am not doing good and what I can improve. This is what I want to see from him. “In general, the whole season, when it comes to defending, compared to other seasons, we did very well. “That also started with Lampard, and now the coach has a different idea, which is to keep the opponents up in their own half and try to win the ball back there rather than winning it further down in our half.”
