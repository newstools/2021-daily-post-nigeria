According to him, the state ministry of education had directed all principals and head teachers to make arrangements to receive boarding and day students of the above stated classes on Monday, 22nd February 2021. He said the state’s COVID-19 Task Force will continue to monitor all schools to ensure that a safe learning environment against the pandemic is strictly adhered to and maintained in addition to the continued enforcement of the COVID-19 Guidelines put in place by the State government. “All administrators of public and private schools must continue to comply with all COVID-19 protocols as any violation may lead to the closure of the affected school without any notice. “Schools will continue to run shifts to enable them to sustain the guidelines already in place and take personal responsibility for their own health by continuing to abide by the simple preventive measures already in place. “School administrators of public and private schools should continue implementing the blended learning system while the Ministry is assuring the public of continuing the e-learning program using Google classrooms, radio and television stations and other online platforms,” he added.
