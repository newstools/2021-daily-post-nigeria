The Niger State Government says it has secured the release of 10 out of 21 travelers in the state-owned Niger State Transport Agency, NSTA, kidnapped last week in Kundu via Yakila in Rafi Local Government of the state. The Commissioner of Information and Strategy, Alhaji Mohammad Dani Idris, made the disclosure in Minna at General Hospital shortly after doctors conducted an examination on three among those rescued to determine the stability of their health status. He explained that the 10 persons were rescued through some ‘multiple strategies’ adopted by the state government. According to him, ” Immediately after the incident, the state government assured to rescue them and they were rescued through multiple strategies and I assure you that Governor Abubakar Dani Bello’s administration will not rest until the rest victims are rescued,” he stated. Idris, however, debunked the allegation of payment of N50 million ransom by the state government to secure the freedom of the victims. “I can not reveal the strategies taken before the victims were rescued and if ransom was paid all of them would have been released by the abductors.” The Commissioner also stated that worried by the increase in banditry and other criminal acts, Governor Sani Bello is into collaboration with neighboring states in the fight against the bandits and other criminals in the state. Confirming the stability of the health status of the victims, the Managing Director of the General Hospital, Ma-ali Isah, explained that they were in a good condition. According to him, “Three of the kidnapped victims recently kidnapped were brought this afternoon, two adults and a child who have been examined and they are in a stable condition.”
