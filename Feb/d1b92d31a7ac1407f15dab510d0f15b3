Who are we to question God?” NAN quoted him as saying The family promised to carry everyone along in the plan to give him “a hero’s farewell that he eminently deserves”.

Ehiemere said the news of his death came to the party as a big shock. “It is painful and very regrettable for us to lose such a man. It’s really painful. “The party is in a very mournful mood. We regret that Ossy died at the peak of his career in life. “We console the family, APGA family and the entire Nigeria,” he said. Ehiemere described Ossy as a human capital developer, a technocrat and businessman, who ventured into politics. He said that Ossy empowered people, fixed roads and touched the lives of widows and orphans.
