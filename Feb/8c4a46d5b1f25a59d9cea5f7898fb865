The Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities, NASU, University of Lagos chapter, has said that there is no going back on the indefinite strike it embarked upon until their demands are met by the Federal Government. Recall that NASU and the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU), had on Jan. 12, embarked on a nationwide protest over government’s failure to honour its agreement. Mr Kehinde Ajibade, Chairman, UNILAG NASU, who made this known to journalists on Friday evening said the union is ready to resist any form of intimidation to resume work until their demands were met. ”Today, we received a directive from the national headquarters of our union to embark on an indefinite strike, starting from Feb.5. ”And the basis of this strike are numerous. The Federal Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), with our unions, NASU and SSANU in 2020. ”This MoU was signed on the agreement that all that was contained therein will be attended to, on or before Dec. 31, 2020, but up till today, nothing has been done. ”Some of the reasons behind this action are issues of inconsistencies in the IPPIS, the payment platform for university workers and a lot of others. ”However, since February 2020, the Federal Government started using IPPIS for our payment, some of our members have not been paid because the system is not organized. We have made series of complaints but up till now, nothing has been done about it,” the chairman said.
