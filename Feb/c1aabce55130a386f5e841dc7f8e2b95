Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Aviation Minister, has reacted to a statement by the Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi, advising Nigerians to defend themselves against bandits Fani-Kayode dared Magashi to equip Nigerians with AK-47 to defend themselves. Magashi, a retired General had advised Nigerians not to be cowards but to defend themselves against bandits. The minister while speaking on insecurity and bandits’ attacks, however, admitted that bandits sometimes possess a few rounds of ammunition. Reacting, Fani-Kayode described the Minister as a failure. In a tweet, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, chieftain said Nigerians won’t run away from bandits if armed with weapons. He wrote: “The Defence Minister says Nigerians are cowards, that they always run when attacked by terrorists and that they should defend and protect themselves. “Does he know that it is his job to protect the people, and he failed? “Equip every Nigerian with an AK 47 and see if they will still run.”
