The Nigerian Navy, NNS Jubilee has said it destroyed 15 militant camps and arrested 17 suspected pirates and sea robbers within its area of jurisdiction in Akwa Ibom. Commodore Abdulmajid Ibrahim, Commander, NNS Jubilee, disclosed this to NAN on Thursday at the Jubilee Base in Ikot Abasi. Ibrahim said the militant camps were discovered and destroyed and suspects arrested during the anti-piracy and anti-sea robbery routine operations from May 2020 to January. The commander said the destruction of the camps was made possible through the navy’s penetration of some of the creeks within the jurisdiction of the base. According to him, during the period, the navy also seized 285, 000 litres of illegally refined AGO and different kinds of ammunition from the suspects. “Within six months as commander of the base, we have destroyed 15 militant camps, arrested 17 suspects during our operations and recovered 285,000 litres of AGO and ammunition from them, and have handed over the suspects and items to the prosecuting agencies. “We were involved in a joint patrol with the police across the base communities every day. This has led to relative peace and security in the area and brought illegal bunkering to the barest minimum. “Our strategy is continuous aggressive patrol. We try to dominate the water space and maritime environment. Within the last six months, there has been no attack on the NNS infrastructure. “We have maintained a good civil-military relationship with our host community, through our Corporate Social Responsibility. “We carry out free medical consultations and give out drugs within our capacity in our medical rhapsody outreach programme,” Ibrahim said.
