Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has urged Nigerians to hold his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Mohammed, responsible if anything happens to him. Ortom said Mohammed’s defence of Fulani herdsmen carrying AK-47 indicated that he was part of an attempt to assassinate him. He recalled that herdsmen had written to him in an attempt to assassinate him. The Governor stated this while addressing journalists in Makurdi, Benue State, yesterday. Ortom said: “I want to think that, with what he said and what those herdsmen wrote to me and said that they were going to assassinate me, Bala Mohammed is also part of it, with what he has said. “And if anything happens to me, I don’t want anybody to be in doubt, Bala Mohammed should be held responsible. Especially his last week outing after the condemnable remarks he made about Fulani carrying AK-47 and living anywhere in Nigeria.” Mohammed had a week ago accused Ortom of perpetrating hatred against the Fulani in Nigeria. Meanwhile, Ortom had accused Mohammed of teaming up with killer herdsmen to eliminate people living in some part of the country, including his State.
