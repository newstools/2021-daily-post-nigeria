Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has named Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, as the two biggest threats to Manchester City winning the Champions League this year. City beat Borussia Monchengladbach 2-0 comfortably on Wednesday, in the first leg of their last-16 tie. Bernardo Silva and Gabriel Jesus scored to wrap up a routine win for the Premier League leaders. Pep Guardiola’s men are now in a strong position to reach the quarter-finals with a home leg to come. Given City’s dominance in the Premier League, many are tipping them to finally go all the way in Europe’s premier competition. But Ferdinand thinks both PSG and Bayern can cause them issues in the later rounds. He said on BT Sport: “I think Bayern have got the experience and the quality. “But I think Paris Saint-Germain as well.”
