The National Chairman, Independent Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu, has disclosed that nearly 10,000 requests have been made for the establishment of additional polling units. Yakubu said the nationwide requests were 5,700 as of October 2020 but had increased by over 4,000 as of February 15. He spoke on Tuesday at the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) office in Kaduna, during consultations on additional polling units in Nigeria. Yakubu explained that INEC has been using 119, 973 polling units since 1996. ”In 1999, the country had 84 million registered voters and the number of polling units remained the same”, NAN quoted him as saying. Yakubu observed that this had caused a lot of congestion and unpleasant voting experience. The chairman said the commission had met with political parties, organizations, security agencies and the media, on the consultation. Yakubu added that INEC was expanding the conversation to socio-cultural associations, traditional and religious organizations, the National Assembly, the Federal Executive Council and the National Council of States.
