Sadiya Farouq, Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, has warned independent monitors of the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) to display diligence and honesty. The minister addressed them at a training on Friday in Awka, Anambra State, during a training. Farouq, represented by Raphael Obi, a Director of Planning, Research and Statistic Department, said monitors who are government employees should not participate in the NSIP. “It is fraudulent to take money from same government that a person works for.The ministry will not delay in taking any independent monitor off the programme, if found violating the terms of engagement. “We have engaged the services of security agencies such as Department of State Security; Economic and Financial Crime Commission and the ICPC to monitor all schemes under the NSIP programme”, she said. Farouq vowed that anyone found engaging in any form of malpractice or fraud will be handed over for investigation and prosecution. The minister urged the participants to help achieve President Muhammadu Buhari’s vision to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years. Farouq disclosed that about 13 million citizens across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory were benefiting from the NSIP. The 150 independent monitors will be assigned to beneficiaries within their locality in schools, households, and market clusters to ensure that the primary objectives of the programmes are achieved.
