Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has provided a fresh injury update on Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney ahead of his side’s Europa League round of 32 clash with Benfica at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome on Thursday night. Arteta said he was unsure whether either player would return to face Benfica on Thursday, adding that Tierney has got ‘a bigger chance’ of making the squad for the midweek match. Partey and Tierney both missed Arsenal’s Premier League 4-2 win over Leeds United on Sunday due to injury. Providing an update on both players, Arteta told a post-match press conference after Arsenal defeated Leeds, “It seems unlikely at the moment, but I don’t know. “Probably if there is one player who has got a bigger chance, it’s Kieran [Tierney]. “Probably in the next few days he can start to do some parts with the team. But I don’t know how he is going to evolve when he gets a little bit closer to training with the group.” The kick-off time for Benfica vs Arsenal is 9 pm.
