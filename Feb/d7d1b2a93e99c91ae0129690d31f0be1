The Federal Government on Monday warned Ministries, Departments and parastatal Agencies (MDAs) not to compel workers on Grade Level (GL) 12 and below to resume work. Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation gave the warning at a briefing on COVID-19 on Monday in Abuja. Mustapha, Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) cited reports of MDAs compelling their workers in the categories to report for work. “For the avoidance of doubts, all employees from GL 12 and below shall continue to work from home. “No agency is allowed to vary this instruction. Permanent Secretaries and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) are to ensure strict compliance,” he said.
