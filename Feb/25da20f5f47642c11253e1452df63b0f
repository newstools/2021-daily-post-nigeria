Former Liverpool and Manchester United striker, Michael Owen, has revealed that the only thing Chelsea needs to win the Premier League title was to sign a top centre-forward. Owen believes Chelsea have not had a top striker since Didier Drogba, who last played for the club in 2015. The former Real Madrid attacker, who spoke to Premier League Productions ahead of Chelsea’s FA Cup fifth-round tie with Barnsley on Thursday night, insisted that the current Blues centre-forwards, Olivier Giroud and Tammy Abraham are not in the list of top 10 strikers in the world. Chelsea last won the Premier League title during the 2016/17 season under former manager, Antonio Conte’s regime. Thomas Tuchel’s side is presently in the 5th position on the Premier League table with 39 points from 23 games. “I have never felt comfortable with Chelsea’s main centre forwards since Drogba probably,” Owen said. “I only say that when I am talking: ‘Are Chelsea going to win the league? Are they real contenders?’ “Of course, they have brilliant players – (Olivier) Giroud’s won the World Cup for goodness sake and is a brilliant player. “But to win the Premier League you need one of the best strikers in the world, and I do not think (Tammy) Abraham or Giroud are in the top 10 strikers in the world. “It is a department that a lot of managers have tried…even Werner – they keep trying to buy bigger, better strikers. I just don’t think they have got it right since and they’ve spent fortunes. “You mentioned Diego Costa, they bought Fernando Torres at the top of his game, (Alvaro) Morata they spent big money on. They know there is a problem. “They get by – it is not glaringly obvious but if they want to win the league [then they must sign a top centre forward].”
