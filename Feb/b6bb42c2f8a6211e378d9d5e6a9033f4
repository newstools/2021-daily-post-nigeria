The Federal Government has said most of the bandits and criminal herdsmen terrorising the country are not Nigerians. Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed spoke on Channels Television programme, Sunrise Daily’. He disclosed that the government is working towards the amendment of ECOWAS Protocols on the free movement of human and cattle within countries. Mohammed explained that scrutiny at land borders was relaxed due to regional agreement. “The ECOWAS Protocols allows trans-human movement between all the ECOWAS countries. That is why we are thinking of seriously reviewing the ECOWAS Protocols in that respect. “What we find out today is that a lot of criminalities have been introduced through the herdsmen and trans-human,’’ he said. The minister added that criminal herdsmen and bandits have access to sophisticated weapons. He cited the proliferation and smuggling of small arms and light weapons across the sub-region. “The issue of smuggling of small and light arms is very serious and it has to do with border control”, Mohammed said.
