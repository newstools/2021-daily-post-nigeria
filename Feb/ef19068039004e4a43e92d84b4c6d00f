This is coming at a time when there are rumours of a political rift between him and the governor ahead of the 2023 general election. He described the rumours as political gimmicks by mischievous elements that do not wish the All Progressives Congress well. DAILY POST reported that the State Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress, APC, sacked the state Acting Chairman Habibu Sara over alleged mismanagement of party funds. Sara, however, while responding to his sack claimed he was removed because of his loyalty to the Senator Sabo Nakudu who is eyeing the Gubernatorial ticket come 2023. He noted that the alleged misunderstanding between him and Governor Badaru and his alleged plan to dump the party for PDP is baseless and unfounded. “As a true and sincere member of the APC, I am absolutely loyal and obedient to Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar and I urged party supporters to disregard the rumours” Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar also re-affirmed that there was no political misunderstanding between him and Senator Sabo Nakudu as being speculated by some party members.
