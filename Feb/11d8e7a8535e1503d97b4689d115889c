Founder of Breast Cancer Association of Nigeria (BRECAN), Betty Akeredolu has blamed religious organisations for the high rates of cancer related deaths. The Ondo Governor’s wife regretted how breast cancer patients shun medical treatment for spiritual healing. NAN reports that Akeredolu spoke on Wednesday at the Inter School Arts Competition for secondary schools in Ibadan, Oyo State. She said most women die of ignorance and blamed them for approaching churches, mosques, and other places for automatic miracles. “Our women present their cases late because they keep going to churches. The man and woman of God will run away immediately when they notice the breast gets rotten. “Breast is external, check it; go to hospital and stop parading miracle mountain. It has to stop in this country because I feel angry talking about late presentations in this country. “I have never seen anyone since 24 years of my advocacy on breast cancer who visits miracle mountains and other spiritual means and gets cured.” Akeredolu insisted that cervical cancer is preventable, adding that it was now easy to handle due to advanced research. She recommended that young women go for HPV vaccination to prevent sexually transmitted infections, a major cause of cervical cancer.
