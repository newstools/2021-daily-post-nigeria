Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has assured the people of Aba that there is no going back on the total recovery of the Eziukwu Cemetery Road, which has been abandoned for close to three decades. Speaking on Thursday, when he paid a working visit to the project, particularly at the Eziukwu Road, Governor Ikpeazu stated that his resolve to rewrite the history of infrastructure in Aba is fully on course. He noted that the target is to push the project to terminate at the Cemetery Market Aba because of the critical role played by the market in the economy of Aba and Abia State. The Governor told the contractor to continue to ensure that all laid down specifications in the design of the project are adhered to strictly. He then asked the contractor to expand the scope of the project to include the fixing of all adjoining junctions which abort at Eziukwu Road, including junctions like Market road, Cameroon road, Ehi Road, etc, assuring that government will be willing to accommodate variations in the contract for the purpose of these additions. Executive Chairmen of Aba South, Aba North and Obingwa LGAs, Hon. Clinton Ebere, Hon. Prince David Ikonne and Hon. Micheal Ibe Nwoke, were all part of the governorâ€™s entourage during the visit.
