The Secretary, Caretaker Committee of the Zamfara State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Sani Mono Mafara, has said that, there is no more crack within the walls of the party in the state. In a telephone conversation with DAILY POST, Alhaji Mafara explained that the crisis between former Governor Abdul Aziz Yari and senator Kabiru Garba Marafa’s factions have been resolved without any grudges. According to the scribe, the ongoing membership registration and revalidation of the party members across the country will be very successful as the APC in the state is now strongly united. “We are now one united family since we have reconciled ourselves and we are now united and more stronger than before”. Alhaji Mono maintained that, anybody believing that APC is still factionalized in Zamfara State is either ignorant of what happened in Abuja or is just a mischief maker who does not mean well to the people of the state. “The national leadership of the party under Mai mala Buni had reconciled the two warring factions where the factions forgave each other in a colourful ceremony at the national headquarters in Abuja. “As I am talking to you now, both the former Governor Abul Aziz Yari and Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa factions of the APC are currently holding a meeting at the residence of former Governor Yari in Kaduna. “So the issue of fractionalization is now history in our great party and we are now a one united family.”
