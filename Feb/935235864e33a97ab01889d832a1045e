Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has warned David de Gea that no-one’s place is safe, following his latest blunders in the 3-3 draw with Everton, SportsMail reports. United were pegged back after going two goals up at Old Trafford and then conceded a last-minute equaliser. De Gea was criticised for pushing the ball out straight to Abdoulaye Doucoure for Everton’s first goal and then making a weak attempt to block Dominic Calvert-Lewin scoring the third. Dean Henderson is likely to be selected in goal for United’s FA Cup tie against West Ham on Tuesday night. However, when Solskjaer was asked about De Gea’s position, he said: “Every player has to earn his place. “We’re a squad with competition and that applies to every single one in the team.”
