Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, says authorities contacted him to say they were at the end of two wrong calls during the clubs’ 2-1 defeat to Sheffield United. Solskjaer claims the refereeing body PGMOL wrote a match report, in which it stated that Kean Bryan’s opener for Sheffield should have been cancelled for a foul on goalkeeper David De Gea. Also, Anthony Martial’s goal should have been allowed to stand. “The momentum shifted for us with the Sheffield United game but I’ve got the delegates’ report from the ref and the two decisions were wrong,” Solskjaer told a news conference on Monday. “They’ve admitted their goal should have been disallowed and our goal should have stood. That’s a big, big momentum changer for us. When you go 1-0 up rather than 1-0 down, go on and win that game.” United followed up their shock loss to Sheffield with a goalless draw at Arsenal on Saturday. Solskjaer’s men will host Southampton on Tuesday.
