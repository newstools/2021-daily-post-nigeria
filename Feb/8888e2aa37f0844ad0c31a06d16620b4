AC Milan midfielder, Franck Kessie, has disclosed that Zlatan Ibrahimovic told Stefano Pioli’s side that ‘there are still many games to go’ following their 3-0 defeat against Inter Milan on Sunday at San Siro. AC Milan was beaten by their city rivals Inter, thanks to a brace from Lautaro Martinez and a strike from Romelu Lukaku. The result means AC Milan are now four points behind leaders Inter Milan at the top of the Serie A table. Speaking after the game, Kessie told Sky Italia,” “He [Ibrahimovic] told us that football is like this. When you lose, it hurts, but we have to raise our heads to go stronger. There are still many games to go.” AC Milan’s next game is against Crvena zvezda in the Europa League on Thursday. Meanwhile, AC Milan coach, Stefano Pioli, has said that Inter Milan defeated AC Milan because his players struggled to find rhythm, intensity, and quality during the game.
