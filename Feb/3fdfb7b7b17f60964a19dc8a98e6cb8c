The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) says the Federal Government has declared war on the people of South-East by its military operation in Orlu, Imo State. DAILY POST reported a military bombardment in Orlu on Thursday which was targeted at the camps of the IPOB-established Eastern Security Network, ESN. Mazi Chika Edoziem, the Head of Directorate of State of the IPOB, in a statement in reaction to the airstrikes, said IPOB worldwide must now gird their loins and be prepared for the long drawn out battle ahead. “The Nigerian government through its military has finally declared open confrontation with the Biafran people in their bid to harass, intimidate and cow us into submission to relinquish our ancestral lands to foreign Fulani terrorists,” he said. The IPOB reiterated its vow that no inch of Biåfran land (Biåfran territory) will be ceded to the Fulani herdsmen. “The Nigerian army has thrown the gauntlet and we the Indigenous People of Biafra shall accept their challenge because there will neither be retreat nor surrender on this our journey to liberty and freedom. “Now that the Nigerian government has activated its final solution to the Biåfran question with Helicopter gunships in Orlu, they have crossed the line of no return and for us the Indigenous People of Biafra there is only one option that is open for us. The IPOB said it must defend every inch of Biafran territory and will defend their inalienable right to live in the land of their forefathers as free people. He called on members of the group to be very conscious of the current situation of things and wait for directives from their leader, Nnamdi Kanu.
