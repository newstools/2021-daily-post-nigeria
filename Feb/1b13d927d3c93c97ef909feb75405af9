The Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, CDHR, has agreed with some Nigerian lawmakers that no other evidence is required to prove that the Nigerian State under President Muhammadu Buhari has not only failed woefully, but has displayed a combination of lacklustre performance characterized by incompetence and indifference. The CDHR stressed that the country under Buhari’s leadership cannot meet the fundamental purpose for which it was established to uphold the security and welfare of the Nigerian people. The CDHR made the assertion in a communiqué signed by its National President, Dr. Osagie Obayuwana. “We affirm that the economic policies of the Buhari government by pauperizing the masses on an ongoing basis, directly and indirectly fuels insecurity as they engender acts of desperation on the part of the unemployed and impoverished teeming population of youths; the pretences through insignificant palliatives notwithstanding.”
