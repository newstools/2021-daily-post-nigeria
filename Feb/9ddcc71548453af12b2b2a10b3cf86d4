The General Overseer, the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor E. A. Adeboye has disowned a list of ‘prayer points’ against Fulani herdsmen, which circulated on social media. In a tweet on Saturday, Adeboye branded it as “fake news”. The cleric insisted he never issued it and also didn’t mandate anyone to issue it on his behalf. The so-called ‘prayer points’ partly read, “The Fulani Moslems, well-organised, have encircled us with high calibre arms and ammunition pretending they are cattle-rearers, wait for orders to overrun our land and kill our people. They have perfected their strategies. “Now, oh Lord, arise and defend us; contend with those that contend with us.” However, Adeboye has urged everyone to disregard the message. The 78-year-old wrote: “Calvary greetings! Please ignore this prayer point titled, “Prayer from Daddy G. O. Adeboye”,” he captioned a copy of the so-called ‘prayer points’. “It is not from me and I have not assigned anyone to come up with it. I am not associated with the content, nor the author of the content. Please beware of such! God bless you!” he added.
