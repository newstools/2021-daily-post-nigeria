The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has claimed that the late Lateef Jakande, the first civilian governor of Lagos State, turned down the chance to become Nigeria’s president. Tinubu revealed this on Friday during the eighth-day Fidau for the deceased at his Ilupeju residence. “Jakande refused to become president. He said ‘I don’t want to be president in the midst of chaos’. “We are lucky to draw from his fountain of wisdom and knowledge. “We can’t beat his records because he is already a martyr but we will pursue our dreams and mission with our vision,” Tinubu said. Jakande passed away last Thursday morning in Lagos at the age of 91. His death was disclosed by the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide-Sanwo-Olu. https://dailypost.ng/2021/02/11/breaking-fomer-lagos-gov-lateef-jakande-is-dead/
