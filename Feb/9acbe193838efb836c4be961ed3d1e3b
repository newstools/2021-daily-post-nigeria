Popular Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmed Gumi on Friday, told Governor Abubakar Bello that the demands of the bandits who abducted students and some members of staff of Government Science College, Kagara in Niger State on Friday, are simple and resolvable. Gumi made this known to newsmen on Friday shortly after his meeting with the Niger State Governor at the government house, Mina, the state capital. He insisted that giving amnesty to bandits as it was given to Niger Delta militants would help in the fight against insecurity in the entire country. According to him, he met with different factions of the bandits in Niger and they all have their complaints, adding that the outcome of the meeting was positive. “The outcome is very positive because we have worrying factions. Each faction is saying they have their own complaints and grievances which are very simple. There is hope that we can resolve this. “I appeal to the government and recommend that the government should do to them exactly what they did to the Niger Delta militants and give them a blanket amnesty. Then if anybody will continue we will deal with him.” DAILY POST had reported that no fewer than 27 students, three staff and 12 members of a family were on Wednesday, abducted by suspected bandits at the Government Science College, Kagara in Rafi Local Government of Niger State.
