The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has intercepted a container load of Tramadol at the Apapa seaport in Lagos. Nearly two million capsules tucked in 554 cartons were discovered in the storage falsely declared to carry ceramic tiles. Apapa Port Area Commander, Samuel Gadzama, disclosed that one of the containers had been intercepted and seized in Kenya. “Though the second container found its way to Nigeria, the eagle eyes of our narcotic agents discovered it during a joint inspection of the ship”, he said. Similarly, operatives of the Lagos Command raided some locations in Agege, Ikorodu, Lekki, Okokomaiko and other parts of the State. They dismantled syndicates’ hideouts and arrested 90 suspects, including an Indian. More than 614 kilograms of various types of drugs were seized. State Commander, Ralph Igwenagu, gave a breakdown of the seizures: Cannabis Sativa 577.020kg, Cocaine 0.183kg, Heroine 0.003kg, Tramadol 36.202kg (7,697) tablets, Rohypnol 0.208kg (646) tablets, Diazepam 0.462kg (2066) tablets, Exol-5 0.52kg (316) tablets. On Samuel Ebenezer, a suspect apprehended in Lekki, NDLEA said his cartel imports drugs baked in cakes, biscuits and cookies from the United States and sells to rich people. The second syndicate, coordinated by Inderpreet Singh, aka Bobby, imports Tramadol 225mg from India and sells from Osy Agomo Close, Apple Estate, Amuwo Odofin in Lagos. “Mr. Singh is also a dealer in tricycle parts and the Managing Director of Rashaan Trading Ltd.
