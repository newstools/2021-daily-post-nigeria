The Lagos State government has warned residents of the State planning to embark on another protest scheduled to hold on Saturday, to desist from flouting the coronavirus protocols. Recall that the panel probing the alleged killing of EndSARS protesters at the toll gate on Saturday approved the reopening of the toll plaza and returned control to its owners, the Lekki Concession Company (LCC). This led to a backlash from Nigerians on social media who kicked against the reopening of the toll gate, stressing that justice is yet to take its due cause. They also vowed to stage another protest with the hashtag #OccupyLekkiTollgate, if the Lagos state government failed to heed to their warnings. Following the development, the Lagos State Commissioner of Justice and Attorney General, Moyosore Onigbanjo, in a statement warned that the state government will not tolerate any form of violent actions. Onigbanjo, however, urged the police to respect the right of citizens. “Our attention is drawn to the planned protest scheduled for Saturday at the Lekki Toll Gate for and against its reopening. “The State is aware of the 1999 Constitution which guarantees the Rights to Freedom of Expression and Peaceful Assembly. “While the State recognises the importance of exercising the Rights to Peaceful Protests, same cannot condone blockage of roads or preventing other members of the public from moving freely within the State. “Any person or group with such desire to protest must also bear in mind the Coronavirus Disease Health Regulations. “The Attorney General hereby enjoins everyone to ensure compliance with the coronavirus regulations and any other extant laws in the State. “The right to protest peacefully does not exempt anyone from violating laws. Any violator will therefore be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. “The Nigeria Police is equally urged, that in responding to any protest, it should respect the rights of the citizen,” the statement said.
