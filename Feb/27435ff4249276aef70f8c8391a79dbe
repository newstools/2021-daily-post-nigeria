Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has included youngster, Lewis Bate, in Chelsea’s squad for their FA Cup fifth-round clash against Barnsley on Thursday night. Tuchel also included another youngster, Tino Anjorin, in Chelsea’s squad for the trip to Barnsley, according to Metro UK. Bate has been training with Chelsea’s first team this week but is yet to make his senior debut. The 18-year-old, who plays in central midfield, is a regular for Chelsea’s Under-23s and was named Premier League 2 Player of the Month last December. Anjorin has scored five goals in eight appearances for Chelsea’s Under-23s this season. The 19-year-old made his full debut under former Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, when the Blues drew 1-1 at Stamford Bridge against Krasnodar in the Champions League last December. Meanwhile, the likes of Billy Gilmour, N’Golo Kante, Hakim Ziyech and Kepa Arrizabalaga are all expected to start the FA Cup clash. Tuchel’s men head to the game after beating Sheffield United 2-1 in the Premier League last weekend. The kick-off time for Barnsley vs Chelsea is 9 pm.
