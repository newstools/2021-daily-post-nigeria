Chukwuemeka Eze, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress and former National Publicity Secretary of the defunct New Peoples Democratic Party, (nPDP), has urged the new Commissioner of Police in Rivers State, Mr. Friday Eboka not to be intimidated in any way by Governor Nyesom Wike and his actions but to do his best to secure the state from the hands of criminals. Eze, in a statement signed and made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday, lashed out at Governor Wike for his alleged penchant for using police authority as willing tools in bulldozing perceived political enemies. The APC chieftain recalled the horrific days of former now Retired Rivers State Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mbu whom he alleged, was used by agents of the past federal government to antagonize ex-Governor Chibuike Amaechi and the citizens of the state. The ex-PDP national spokesman alleged that Governor Wike is becoming afraid of the new Police CP who he described as a thorough professional, a versatile personality with an impeccable track record in crime-fighting. According to him, “It is sad and unfortunate that Governor Wike who is afraid of his records with Mr. Joseph Mbu whom he used to torment and put Rivers State in a bad light is afraid that a gentle Officer like Mr. Eboka will act like Mr. Mbu in his infamous acts when he was in Rivers State. “If we actually need a Commissioner of Police that will assist Rivers State to curb and tackle the menace of criminality growing rapidly in the state where kidnapping, assassination have become the order of the day, then Mr. Friday Eboka is that officer who has intimidating records in crime fighting”.
