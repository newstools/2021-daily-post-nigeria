President Muhammadu Buhari has described the passing of Prince Tony Momoh as a loss to the human community. His message was delivered on Monday in Abuja by his Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari, who led a federal government delegation to Momoh’s family. “We have lost a dear friend, a great Nigerian, a true patriot and a philanthropist. We have lost a valuable member of the human community. But he has left tremendous footprints. “He has been a politician, a writer, a publisher and also a party man with a conscience and a servant of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as a Minister.” Buhari recalled that Momoh introduced direct communication with people of Nigeria on issues in a patriotic and dispassionate manner. The President added that the late Auchi Prince would be greatly missed of course by the family and also by many whose lives he touched. He prayed that God will receive Momoh “back in heaven as one of his favourite servants here on earth,” and grant the family the fortitude to bear the loss.
