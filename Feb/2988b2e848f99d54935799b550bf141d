DAILY POST gathered that the suspects had invaded Fastlink phone and electronics warehouse in Ijebu-Ode. One other member of the group was apprehended alive by the police as others fled. DAILY POST further gathered that a distress call was received by the DPO of Igbeba division, CSP Doga Najeem, from a local vigilante leader, that the warehouse situated in Oyingbo area of Ijebu-ode had been burgled by men suspected to be robbers, “who were armed with dangerous weapons.” Upon the distress call, the DPO was said to have mobilised his team, in conjunction with operatives of the So-Safe Corps, and moved to the scene. “On sighting the policemen, the robbers engaged them in a gun battle for about an hour, at the end of which two members of the gang were fatally shot and one arrested. Others escaped in their standby vehicle with various degrees of gunshot injuries,” the Command spokesperson, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST. While he was interrogated, the arrested suspect, 28-year-old Isiaka Yakubu, an indigene of Yauri in Zamfara State, claimed that they were eight in number, adding that they came from Lagos State to operate in Ijebu-Ode.
