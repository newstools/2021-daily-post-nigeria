Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho has accused the federal government of planning to eliminate him. He made the accusations on a radio programme, City Talks with Reuben Abati. The Yoruba activist lambasted the government for negotiating with bandits and paying ransom to them Igboho spoke on his recent face-off with the Department of State Services (DSS) on the Lagos-Ibadan highway. The self-acclaimed freedom fighter recalled that he took off his clothes when operatives fired shots. He called the event an embarrassment and insisted he was fighting for the Yoruba. “I’m not a criminal, I’m a businessman. I pay my tax to the government every month, I have evidence. Should I be going on the road and some people attempt to kill me? Why do they want to kill me? Their plan on Friday was to kill me. “You put fear in us so we cannot move about. They encourage and give money to Boko Haram and bandits. Fulani people raping and killing our people in the forests but security operatives are not going after them. “It is those of us you’re killing that the government and DSS are chasing. Should that be the situation?”, Igboho queried. The DSS denied reports that its operatives attempted to arrest the citizen. “The said news is misinforming and should be taken as fake and therefore be disregarded”, Peter Afunanya, the spokesman said.
