Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has cautioned political and religious leaders to stop reckless utterances that could lead to war. He gave the warning on Saturday at the 2021 Lagos State Interdenominational Divine Service organised by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) at the Apostolic Church, Ketu. The governor said the ongoing crises may be aggravated due to incendiary comments possible of stoking division and violence. He said the nation faced a difficult period in the year 2020 after the outbreak of COVID-19 and youth restiveness. Sanwo-Olu advised religious leaders to use their pulpits to preach peace and discourage war. “We have all witnessed the challenges of our country, but we need to be careful not to turn the observed crises into ethnic or religious war”, NAN quoted him as saying. “We need to guard against utterances that may stereotype anyone or tribes. We have a duty to isolate criminals in our communities rather than introducing tribal spin into every crime.
