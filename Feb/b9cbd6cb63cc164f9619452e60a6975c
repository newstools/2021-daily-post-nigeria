Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has provided the latest injury update on midfielder, Paul Pogba, ahead of his side’s Europa League clash with Real Sociedad on Thursday night. Pogba has not played for Man United since limping out of the 3-3 draw with Everton on February 6 with a thigh injury. The France World Cup winner also missed last week’s FA Cup win over West Ham and Sunday’s draw with West Brom. Providing an update on Pogba, Solskjaer said at his pre-match press conference that the former Juventus star would not return to action until March at the earliest. “Paul is recovering well,” Solskjaer told reporters. “He’s starting the treatment, but it will still be a few weeks. He won’t be playing in February, that’s for sure, it’s still a few weeks before we see Paul definitely. “We won’t see him in February, that’s for sure.”
