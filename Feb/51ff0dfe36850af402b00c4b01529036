The All Progressives Congress (APC) has reacted to the killing of its Ward Chairman in Gboko Local Government Area of Benue State, Mr Tersoo Ahu. The party called on all security agencies to ensure that the killers are brought to book, stressing that APC remains a peaceful party both in the state and across the nation. The Chairman was reportedly killed by hoodlums on Sunday in Gboko Local Government Area (LGA) of the state. Mr James Ornguga, the state APC Publicity Secretary, told NAN in Makurdi on Sunday that the party totally condemned the killing. The incident took place at the APC membership registration/revalidation training centre for ward and polling units officers in Gboko. “We strongly condemn the killing of our ward chairman. APC is a very peaceful party, and we don’t believe in violence. “So, wherever this is coming from, the party frowns at it. We call on the security agencies to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book,” he said. Meanwhile, the police command in the state had earlier confirmed the killing of Ahu by hoodlums at the training centre, adding that investigation had already begun.
