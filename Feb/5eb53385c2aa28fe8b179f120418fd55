Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has provided injury update on Edinson Cavani and Eric Bailly ahead of his side’s Premier League clash against Everton on Saturday night at Old Trafford. Cavani sustained a knock during Man United’s win against Southampton on Tuesday, while Bailly did not feature in the encounter. Providing an update on his players, Solskjaer said at his pre-match press conference on Friday, “Edinson should be available, yeah, definitely. “He got a bad ankle knock there. Eric [Bailly] is a doubt. Apart from that everyone’s raring to go.” He added, “Sergio’s working hard, training. He’s in the group. Of course, he lost a lot of training early on in the season. “He joined us very late on after having some time back home, and over Christmas as well, he’s had some time back in Argentina with the family. He’s working with the keepers. But of course, with Dean [Henderson] and Lee [Grant] and David [De Gea], it’s been more difficult to get into the match squad.” Man United head to the game after thrashing Southampton 9-0 in their previous game on Wednesday, while Everton won 2-1 against Leeds United. The kick-off time for Man United vs Everton is 9 pm.
