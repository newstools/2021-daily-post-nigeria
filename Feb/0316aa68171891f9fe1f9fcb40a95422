Devolution of power and regional integration has been advocated as the solution to insecurity and a potent means of engendering prosperity in Nigeria. This assertion was made by Oba Adekunle Oyelude, the Olowu Kuta during an interview organised by the Osun Civic Engagement team on Tuesday. DAILY POST reports that Oba Oyelude advocated for true federalism as an arrangement where powers are shared among the federating units which are coordinate to exert overwhelming influence over their sphere of jurisdiction without any form of usurpation According to the traditional ruler, “True federalism as a system that promotes devolution of power is the only institutional framework that arrogates exercisable amount of power and resources to every state to have overbearing influence on the governance activities within its spheres.” “Taming insecurity and engendering social wellbeing are only realisable in Nigeria when the workload of the federal government emanating from the excessive power and influence which it wields can be assuaged. “This in addition to the promotion of regional integration among states for mutual and cordial socioeconomic and political cooperation will facilitate a number of developmental indices such as employment, industrialisation, peace and stability among others”, he added. In the past, Oba Oyelude had been a vocal supporter of Lt. Gen. Yusuf Tukur Buratai, the past Chief of Army Staff in his fight against insurgency and banditry in the country.
