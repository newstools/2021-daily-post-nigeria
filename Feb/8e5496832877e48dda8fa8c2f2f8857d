The Corps Marshal, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Boboye Oyeyemi has ordered officers to seize all unsound vehicles plying Nigerian roads. In a statement on Tuesday, Bisi Kazeem, Corps Public Education Officer, said the clampdown was part of efforts to reduce crashes across the country. Zonal Commanding Officers and Sector Commanders have been directed to commence a nationwide arrest, impoundment, and prosecution of owners or operators of rickety vehicles. The spokesman said FRSC was determined to lower road traffic crashes by at least 15 percent and fatalities by 20 percent in 2021. The agency noted that poorly maintained vehicles often cause obstruction of traffic flow. “If drivers and vehicle owners will adhere to constant maintenance of their vehicles, safety of lives and properties will be enhanced”, the statement read. Kazeem said severe punishment awaits anyone apprehended. He listed seizure of the vehicle, payment of fines and compulsory road safety education. FRSC advised the public to report rickety vehicles sighted on the road via toll free number – 122.
