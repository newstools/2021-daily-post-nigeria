The office of the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP), has launched investigations into the fraudulent activities of some contractors and vendors engaged by the scheme to train and empower ex-agitators in the Niger Delta region. The Interim Administrator, PAP, Col. Milland Dixon Dikio, who confirmed the development in a statement at the weekend said, already preliminary investigations had uncovered acts of fraud perpetrated by some of the contractors. He said the office expanded its investigations to determine the extent of the scam and the involvement or connivance of internal elements in the fraud. Dikio said the ongoing probe would not stop the payment of contractors whose documents had been verified, immediately expected funds were released to the office. The amnesty boss explained that before the end of last year, the office sequentially paid 104 contractors owed by the scheme, adding that payments would continue based on the availability of funds till every genuine contractor receive their money. “It must be noted that while the continuing process is evidence of the PAP’s commitment to its mandate which covers the delegates, the investigations will continue to ascertain the issues that gave rise to this allegation. “Meanwhile vendors/contractors whose contracts have not been revalidated, have not received an approval to self-fund or been mobilized for their respective contracts are advised to suspend and maintain the status quo”.
