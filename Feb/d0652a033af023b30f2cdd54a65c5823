The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has cautioned members of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) against taking laws into their hands. He urged OPC members not to be involved in extra-judicial activities that would create problems. The monarch spoke in his palace when he received OPC members led by its President, Prince Osibote, on Thursday, NAN reports. The Ooni charged the group to be law-abiding in and promote the ethics and principles of Yoruba tradition. “Do not involve yourself in extrajudicial practices that could create more problems than we are trying to solve.” Ooni also called for unity among members of the group. “For the sake of the sweet memories of your late founder, Frederick Fasehun, I am appealing to all of you to have a rallying point so that you can be united. “You can have several leaders all over, what I am appealing for is the unity of purpose and common interest toward developing the Yoruba nation. “If you know the meaning of the name ‘Oduduwa’, you would place it high above all forms of selfish interests. “I urge you all to be conscious of your words and actions because the people out there are watching,’’ he said.
