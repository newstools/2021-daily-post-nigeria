The Governor Dapo Abiodun-led government in Ogun State has said it did not seek the help of Sunday Adeyemo Igboho to chase away Fulani herdsmen in the state. There have been reports of killings and kidnapping by suspected herdsmen in different areas of Ogun State. Residents of Yewa, Abeokuta North, Odeda and some parts of Ijebu have decried what they termed the inability of government to tame the killer herdsmen, whom they accused of killing, raping and kidnapping innocent citizens. On Monday, Sunday Igboho stormed Yewa axis of the state, with a threat to chase away Fulani herdsmen in Oja Odan and Igua. He said the Governor of the state had spoken up against the gruesome killing of his people, allowing him to visit the state for the mission. But, the Ogun State government has refuted the claim that it requested the help of Sunday Igboho to help combat crimes in the state. According to the statement signed by the State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Abdulwaheed Odusile, on Monday, the government said it “will neither welcome nor endorse any initiative that amounts to self-help or is outside the contemplation of the constitution.” Odusile expressed sadness that a statement credited to Hon. Remmy Hazzan, the Special Adviser on Public Communication to Gov Abiodun, that the state would continue to work with all the stakeholders to ensure security of lives and properties was twisted to mean that the State had invited Sunday Igboho to help curb insecurity. “This is regrettable and totally misleading,” Odusile stated. “At all times, the Government will ensure that all security agencies and indeed all stakeholders operate within the ambit of the law,” it was said. The statement added that the government would continue to attract and welcome all those with legitimate reasons to live, work and even play in the State, saying that it is home to all Nigerians and foreigners alike.
