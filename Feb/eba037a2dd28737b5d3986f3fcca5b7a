Bayern Munich defender, David Alaba, has given a condition to sign for Chelsea this summer transfer window. Alaba will join Chelsea at the end of the season if the Premier League giants pay him around £20million-a-year. The Telegraph reports that Alaba has asked for close to £400,000-a-week to move to the West London club from Bayern. That would make Alaba Chelsea’s highest-paid player at Stamford Bridge, with N’Golo Kante, the current top earner on around £295,000-a-week. The 28-year-old is set to leave Bayern Munich on a free transfer this summer. Alaba’s current deal with Bayern Munich will expire at the end of June 2021. Chelsea are among interested clubs that want to secure the service of Alaba, with Real Madrid leading the way for his signature. Alaba’s current contract with Bayern Munich will expire at the end of June 2021. The Austrian recently turned down a £200,000 a week contract extension to remain at the Champions League holders. Bayern permitted Alaba to discuss moves with other clubs after he turned down the club’s last offer.
