Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has disclosed that the club’s target is to finish in the top four positions on the Premier League table this season. Tuchel made this known following Chelsea’s Premier League 2-0 victory over Newcastle United on Monday night at Stamford Bridge, thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and Timo Werner. Tuchel’s men are now in the 4th position on the Premier League table with 42 points after beating Newcastle. “Top four is the target and stays the target There are many teams behind us chasing,” Tuchel told a post-match press conference. “We had many points to recover, and it stays a big challenge because many games are coming. “We’re going to play teams from the top and bottom, every game is difficult, and we will keep fighting.” Chelsea will face Southampton on Saturday in their next Premier League fixture.
