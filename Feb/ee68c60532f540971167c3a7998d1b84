All three members of the Ogun State House of Assembly from the African Democratic Congress (ADC) have defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The lawmakers’ defection was announced in separate letters read by the Speaker of the Assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, during plenary in Abeokuta on Tuesday. The defectors are Jemili Akingbade (Imeko Afon), Adegoke Adeyanju (Yewa North 1) and Wahab Haruna (Yewa North 2). According to them, they had decided to join the ruling party after due consultations with constituents and supporters. Responding, the Speaker congratulated them for joining the ruling party, adding that their arrival into the APC would be for the development of the party and the state at large.
