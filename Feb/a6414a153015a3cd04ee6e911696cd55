Senator Kabiru Gaya (APC-Kano) has said that Nigeria must learn from the U.S. election by putting in place structures to ensure free, fair and credible 2023 general elections. Gaya, who is also Chairman, Senate Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), said this while speaking at the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) forum in Abuja. He said the National Assembly Joint Committee on INEC and Electoral Matters would strive towards presenting an Electoral Bill that will ensure free, fair and credible elections in the country. “I believe we have learnt a lot from the U.S. and we have to put in place some kind of laws to prevent such from happening in Nigeria,” he said. Gaya advised the U.S. government to stay firm to prevent demonstrators from heating its polity. He said the controversies that followed the election were uncalled for, considering the fact that the U.S. was a leading democratic nation in the world. “It was embarrassing that the U.S. went through such a crisis like a third world country,” he said. Gaya said that while monitoring campaigns between former President Donald Trump and Joe Bidden ahead of the election, he had predicted that Bidden would win but that there would be a crisis afterwards. He said that whenever there were political demonstrations in third world countries, the U.S. would be the first to make a criticism. “It had now happened to them: we were all disappointed, but I feel it was a lesson for us to learn from. “And for Donald Trump to be a bit more stubborn and to encourage people to go and demonstrate was unfair for a president,” he said.
