The anti-robbery squad of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has rescued a woman and her three children from armed kidnappers. The quartet were abducted at Kekeshi village in Abaji area council, on Sunday morning. Acting on a distress call, the Police squad responded and stormed the community. The swift action led to the rescue of the captives within a few hours. “Our anti-kidnapping squad engaged the gunmen in a fierce gun battle and overwhelmed the criminals. “The woman and her children were rescued safely around 1:30pm,” a Police intelligence told PRNigeria. The FCT command launched a counter-kidnapping operation early this month. Days later, on February 6, six male suspected kidnappers were nabbed along Apo axis. They are Frank Ozor (26), Nweke Uche (19), Chester Uzor (25), Chukwu Bethrand (27), Chukwu Samuel (25) and Kelechi Ngene (26). They earlier abducted three persons and were arrested by Police Operatives on routine patrol while attempting to relocate one of their victims. An investigation led to the successful rescue of two other victims who identified the suspects.
