Olympiacos defender, Sokratis Papastathopoulos, has expressed confidence Arsenal has areas his team can hit to harm them when both sides clash in the Europa League last-16 first-leg tie on March 11 in Greece. Sokratis spent almost three years with Arsenal before leaving the Gunners in January to join Olympiacos on a free transfer. Olympiacos knocked out Arsenal from the Europa League when both sides met in the competition last year. And Sokratis believes Mikel Arteta’s side still have weak spots in their team that Olympiacos can exploit. “It is something special because until a month ago I was with them. I think it will be a difficult game. Arsenal are a very big team,” Sokratis said as quoted by Metro UK. “We have to be focused during both games to repeat last year. “There are no big differences because he is the same coach. More or less, it is the same team with two or three additions. “It is a team with great quality, but there are also areas we can hit to harm them. “Each game will be different. We should see them as two separate games. I believe that the coach has in mind the tactics that we must follow. In combination with a good appearance and a good day, I believe that we have chances.”
