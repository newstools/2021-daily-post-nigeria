A civil rights organisation, Save Lagos Group (SLG) has asked the Federal and Oyo State Governments to fish out the security operatives over a “physical fresh attack and attempt” on Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho on Friday. It advised the DSS to stop denying the foiled attempt to arrest Sunday Igboho on Friday as widely reported in the media, recalling that the men of the secret police have tried similar action on Founder of online medium, Sahara Reporters and Revolutionary, Comrade Omoyele Sowore at the premises of the Court last year. The group disclosed that the state government has become a burden on the people whom it ought to protect and safeguard. The men of the Department of State Security (DSS), Police and Soldiers, have allegedly attacked Sunday Igboho at Guru Maraj’s area in Ibadan, the capital of Oyo State on Friday, while he was going for a meeting with Afenifere Leaders in Lagos. The group in a statement issued in Lagos on Saturday signed by its Convener, Comrade Alimi Sulaiman lamented that findings from research conducted by the Save Lagos Group have shown that the state government has become a burden on the people whom it ought to protect and safeguard. “The responsibility of governments all over the world is to protect and safeguard the safety and well-being of the people by putting in place measures that would alleviate their sufferings as well as those that would enhance their day-to-day living. “Sadly, this is not the case when you see what is going on in Lagos State, where successive governments in the state have shirk their responsibilities to the people by becoming a burden on them through various punitive and exploitative measures which have come to become a yoke on the people,” Sulaiman stated.
