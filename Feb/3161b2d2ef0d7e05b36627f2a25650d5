Former Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has condemned the arrest of End SARS protesters in Lekki toll gate, Lagos State. Atiku said the Nigerian constitution allows citizens to peacefully protest. In a series of tweets, the former Vice President said security agents should ensure a conducive environment for peaceful protesters. According to Atiku: “The 1999 Nigerian constitution, as amended (Section 40) guarantees the right of citizens to peaceful protest. The courts have also affirmed that right. Anything contrary to that is not acceptable and stands condemned. “It is the security agents’ responsibility to provide a secured conducive environment for citizens to protest peaceably in line with constitutional provisions and the African Charter on Human rights.” Recall that men of the Nigeria Police Force had arrested peaceful protesters demonstrating against the reopening of Lekki tollgate. Lekki toll gate was shut down after the October 20, 2020 incident involving protesters and security agents. But, the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on the End SARS had recently granted the Lekki Concession Company, LCC, permission to reopen the Lekki toll gate. Frowning at the decision, the End SARS protesters had called for demonstration over the reopening of the Lekki toll gate.
