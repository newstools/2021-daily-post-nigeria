Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, is hoping to be fit for their Champions League clash at his former club Barcelona next week. The Brazilian star was injured in their 1-0 win over Caen in the French Cup on Wednesday. Neymar went down after a heavy challenge from Steeve Yago in the 56th minute and was replaced by Kylian Mbappe. After the match, PSG manager, Muricio Pochettino said Neymar injured his adductor, but couldn’t confirm how long he would be out. “It’s hard to know now, we’ll see [Thursday] with the doctor, for the moment it’s hard to say,” Pochettino said. “Can he be there [at Barcelona] next week? I need more information. Is he affected in the adductors? Yes.” PSG will be without the injured Angel Di Maria for the trip, who injured his thigh last Sunday against Marseille.
