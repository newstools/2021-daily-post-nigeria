Former Abia State Governor and Senate Chief Whip, Dr Orji Uzor Kalu has asked a Federal High Court in Abuja to prohibit the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) from retrying him on the same alleged N7.1B money laundering charges brought against him. Kalu contented that having been tried once by EFCC, convicted and sentenced in the same charges FHC/ABJ/CR/56/ 2007, it will amount to double jeopardy for him if he is allowed to be subjected to a fresh trial on the same charge. In an ex-parte motion moved before Justice Inyang Ekwo on Tuesday through his counsel, Profesor Awa Kalu (SAN), Senator Kalu who was in court personally pleaded with the court to rescue him from suffering twice. He further sought for an order of the court prohibiting the Federal Republic of Nigeria, through the EFCC, its officers, servants, others, agents, privies and any other person or bodies deriving authority from the Federal Republic of Nigeria, from retrying him on charge No. FHC/ABJ/CR/56/2007 between FRN vs Orji Kalu & 2 ors or any other charge based on the same facts de novo, there being no extant judgment and ruling of a competent court in Nigeria mandating same. The ex-governor also applied for orders prohibiting the Federal Republic of Nigeria, through the EFCC (her agent), her officers, servants, others, agents, privies and any other person or bodies deriving authority from the Federal Republic of Nigeria, from retrying, harassing and intimidating him with respect to the charge as concerns charge No: FHC/ABJ/CR/56/2007 between FRN vs Orji Kalu & 2 ors or any other charge based on the same facts as he need not suffer double jeopardy. Kalu further asked that if his application is granted, it should operate as a stay of proceedings until the determination of the application or until the Judge otherwise orders. DAILY POST had reported that the arraignment slated for Tuesday was put off as EFCC applied that the trial of the former governor be transferred from Abuja to the Lagos division of the court.
