The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has spoken out about a purported plan to change its name ahead of the 2023 election. Kola Ologbondiyan, National Publicity Secretary, in a statement on Tuesday downed the speculations.
“We will not change our brand. Our strength is in our name, the PDP”, he quoted the National Chairman, Uche Secondus, as saying. “We are not in any contemplation of changing our name. It does not matter how many times other parties changed their names. Our name remains the PDP.” The opposition leader stressed that the party will remain steadfast in its ideals, assuming that the PDP will maintain its identity. Secondus insisted the PDP was the only hope to restore peace, national cohesiveness and “save Nigeria from collapse”.
