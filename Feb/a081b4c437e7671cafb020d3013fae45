Former President Goodluck Jonathan met with the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Reconciliation and Strategy Committee. The meeting was part of efforts to resolve the internal crisis within the opposition. The party last year appointed former Senate President, Bukola Saraki to head its national reconciliation committee. Saraki, who disclosed this in a tweet, on Tuesday wrote: â€œAs part of our efforts to listen to the concerns of key stakeholders across our great party, this afternoon, the @OfficialPDPNig Reconciliation and Strategy Committee is meeting with our immediate past President, H.E. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan (@GEJonathan). Just a few days ago, Jonathan had dismissed reports of him defecting to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Reports had disclosed that APC was considering Jonathan for its presidential ticket in 2023. However, the former president distanced himself from such claims, stressing that he was still a PDP member.
