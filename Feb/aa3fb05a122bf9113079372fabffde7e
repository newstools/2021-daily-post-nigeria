President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad, has downplayed the possibility of Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister returning to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Ahmad said Fani-Kayode may not be welcomed back into APC if he opts to return to the party. He stated this while sharing a report that the former minister was preparing to defect to APC. In a tweet, Ahmad wrote: “Tabdijan “If he decides to join the governing party, I don’t think he will be welcome by majority of the party members, who he made it a duty to attack and insult for several years.” Bashir’s comment is coming at a time APC governors had said the former minister won’t be accepted back into the party. Reports hinting on the possibility of Fani-Kayode defecting to APC broke out yesterday after he met with chieftains of the ruling party in Abuja. Fani-Kayode, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, had met with APC acting National Chairman, Mala Mai Buni and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. Explaining why he met APC leaders, Fani-Kayode, a staunch critic of the ruling party had said the meeting centred on how to move Nigeria forward.
