Boko Haram insurgents on Tuesday night attacked Marte and Gubio Local Government Areas of Borno State. Although the report by residents of the area could not reach Maiduguri on time due to lack of telecommunication network in the area, residents said they could not ascertain the number of casualties as most people were yet to return to their homes. However, in Gubio, residents said the insurgents stormed one of the vigilante/hunters checkpoints and opened fire on them, leaving one of the hunters dead with others sustaining gunshot wounds before they were repelled by military troops. While in Marte, residents said the armed insurgents dislodged a military base before invading New Marte community, brandishing weapons and shooting sporadically as residents scampered for safety. Sources also said the insurgents have taken over the town since yesterday (Tuesday) up to Wednesday noon before troops were reinforced to repel them. Member of the Borno State House of Assembly, Marte constituency, Hon. Engineer Mohammed Gambomi, confirmed the attack on Marte town. He told newsmen that he received a distress call that Boko Haram sect invaded Marte, but did not have details on the number of casualties, only that some few residential houses were torched during the encounter. His words; ” Yes, there was an attack by suspected members of Boko Haram on Marte community yesterday. But from the reports I got, civilians are safe,” Gambomi said.
