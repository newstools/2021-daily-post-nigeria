Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, will be without Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey for this weekend’s Premier League clash against Leeds United. Tierney has been the Gunners’ last five fixtures in all competitions. However, the club hopes to have the Scot back in full training next week. Partey limped off during last week’s 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa. The Ghana midfielder had broken down on two separate occasions already this season but made his latest return in January and featured in seven successive matches, before appearing to suffer a recurrence of a thigh strain against Villa. “Thomas sustained a strain to his left hamstring during last Saturday’s match at Aston Villa and will miss the match against Leeds United on Sunday,” read a statement on Arsenal’s website. “Thomas will continue to be assessed and rehabilitated from this injury.
