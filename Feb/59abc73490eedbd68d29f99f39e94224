A civil servant, Oyeniyi Oyedepo, on Friday, told a Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan to end his 14-year-old marriage to Iyabo, because his wife slaps him whenever he disciplines their four children. NAN reports that Oyedepo in his petition told the court that his wife has destroyed their union. “Whenever I beat any of our children for misbehaving, Iyabo becomes offended and would slap me. “She is so disobedient and rude,” Oyedepo said. In her response, Iyabo consented to the divorce adding that her husband is a womanizer. She told the court that her husband is clumsy and dirty. “Yes, I slapped him. But it was because he beat me up and told me to leave his home. “Moreover, I want this marriage to end because I don’t love him anymore,” she said. Delivering Judgement, the President of the Court, Chief Ademola Odunade, told the couple that their marriage could still work if they can be patient. He also adjourned the suit until April 6, for further hearing.
