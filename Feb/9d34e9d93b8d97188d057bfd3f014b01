The former Cross River State Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), John Ochala, has said that logistic challenges hindered the revalidation exercise of the party in Cross River State. Responding to text message sent to him in respect of the exercise on Tuesday, Ochala lamented, “Since we are to convey all materials to units for ease of registration, this slows down the process” Ochala also pointed out that members of the party and others who would have wished to participate in the exercise do not have passport photographs which also hinders the work. “Most members staying in rural communities do not have passport photographs handy,” he noted. DAILY POST reporter, who went round some local government areas including Calabar South, Calabar Municipal, Akpabuyo, Bakassi, Akamkpa, observed that the exercise was yet to take off fully in those areas and others.
