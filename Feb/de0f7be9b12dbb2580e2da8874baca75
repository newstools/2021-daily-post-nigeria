A commercial driver, Kamorudeen Olateju, has been kidnapped by unknown gunmen while driving along Ayetoro-Abeokuta road in Ogun State. The driver was reportedly abducted alongside one Ms Saidat Adediran and three other passengers on Saturday, at about 4:45am in Iwofin, an area around Olorunda, Abeokuta North Local Government area of the State. The incident was said to have been reported at the Imala police divisional headquarters by two relatives of the abductees, Abubakar Olateju of Emado quarters and Kehinde Adediran, residing at Obon Oselu, all in Ayetoro. A source revealed to DAILY POST that the gunmen accosted the driver, who is also known as Charger, and whisked him away with the passengers he was conveying from Ayetoro in Yewa North Local Government to Abeokuta, the state capital. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST on Sunday. However, Oyeyemi said only two persons were abducted, adding that one of the kidnappers had been arrested by the police. “Yes, two people were abducted, but one of the kidnappers has been arrested,” Oyeyemi told DAILY POST in a chat. It was learnt that a kidnap kingpin identified as Hassan Usman, who had sometimes been declared wanted by the Oyo State police command, was arrested in the area and taken to state CIID, Eleweran, Abeokuta on Saturday. It will be recalled that this incident is coming less than a week after one Mrs Ajoke Ishola was abducted and allegedly killed by some suspected herdsmen along Igbo-Ori, Yewa North. At the moment, policemen and operatives of the So-Safe Corps had been mobilised to comb the bush in search of the abductees.
