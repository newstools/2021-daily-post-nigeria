Yobe State Emergency Agency, (SEMA), said it has in the last three weeks received and profiled more than 3,000 Internally Displaced Persons, (IDPs), from its neighbouring State of Borno. The Agency in its official Facebook page disclosed that the new arrivals were from Magumeri, Kaga, Konduga and Damboa Local Government Areas of Borno State who were displaced as a result of insurgency.  It posted that the agency alongside security operatives and Damaturu Local Government representatives profiled the new arrivals in an effort to integrate them into the host community to cushion their hardship until security improves in their ancestral homes. In line with Governor Mai Mala Buni’s directive, the agency also announced that elderly, pregnant women and households with under five-year children were immediately supported with food. While presenting the baskets of food to the beneficiaries, SEMA called on the new arrivals to be law-abiding while residing within the host community and further informed them of Governor Buni’s commitment towards providing solace to vulnerable groups.
