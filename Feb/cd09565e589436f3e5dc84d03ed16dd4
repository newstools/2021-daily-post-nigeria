The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) has named some Federal Government enterprises slated for concession. Amina Othman, Head of Public Communications, BPE disclosed this in a statement on Sunday. The list includes Tafawa Balewa Trade Fair Complex (aka TBS), Lagos International Trade Fair Complex (LITFC), Calabar Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and Kano Special Economic Zone (SEZ). The bureau will meet international investors later in February to showcase opportunities in the four enterprises. Last December, Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, clarified the roles of the BPE and the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) in Public-Private Partnership (PPP) engagements. He said the BPE acts on behalf of the Federal Government as a counter-party of all the infrastructure projects being developed on PPP basis. The ICRC serves as the regulatory agency for PPP transactions with powers to inspect, supervise and monitor the projects and processes to ensure compliance with relevant laws and policies.
