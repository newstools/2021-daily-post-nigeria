Former Liverpool midfielder, Graeme Souness, has slammed Manchester United captain, Harry Maguire, for diving following the Reds’ Premier League 1-1 draw with West Brom on Sunday. Souness said that Maguire went to the ground as though he had been hit with a baseball bat during Man United’s clash with West Brom at Hawthorns. Goals from Mbaye Diagne and Bruno Fernandes ensured Man United and West Brom got a point each. “It’s clearly offside and he [Harry Maguire] goes to ground as though he’s been hit with a baseball bat,” Souness told Sky Sports. “He said he thinks it’s a penalty. It’s not enough to bring him down the way he goes down. He throws himself to the ground. It’s not a penalty.” Souness added: “This is such a bad result for Manchester United. “Maguire has just said it’s a difficult place to come, West Brom has won one game at home against the bottom team, that’s a difficult place to go if you’re second or third in the league? “West Brom had the better chances. That is an exceptionally poor performance and result for Manchester United when you think they have got a chance of putting the pressure on Manchester City.”
