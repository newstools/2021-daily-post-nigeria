Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has identified one area his team must improve after failing to beat Everton in the Premier League on Saturday night. Solskjaer said Man United must stop conceding easy goals against opponents going forward after playing a 3-3 draw with Everton. Solskjaer’s men failed to get all three points against Everton at Old Trafford as goals from Edinson Cavani, Bruno Fernandes, Scott McTominay, Abdoulaye Doucoure, James Rodriguez and Dominic Calvert-Lewin ensured both teams shared a point each. The result means Man United are now two points behind leaders Manchester City, who have two games in hand. “We have got to be better as a team and then see where we end up,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports after the game. “Going forward, we were very good, but we need to stop conceding easy goals.” Man United’s next fixture is against West Ham in the FA Cup on Tuesday.
