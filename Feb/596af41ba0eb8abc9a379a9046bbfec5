Cross River Government security outfit ‘Operation Akpakwu’ have freed pregnant girls from a baby factory in Anantigha area of Calabar. Operatives rescued 24 pregnant ladies, 11 children and arrested two suspects. Maj. Stanley Ikepeme handed them to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) on behalf of the 13 Brigade Commander, Brig.-Gen. Mohammed Abdullahi on Wednesday. A NAPTIP official, Oba Jacobs, stated that the suspects would be investigated and charged to court. “We urge the public to assist us with useful information that would lead to the arrest of this category of people involved in this kind of racket,” he said. Alleged owner of the baby factory, Mrs Fedelia Daniel, denied knowledge of the place. Stella John, one of the rescued teenagers who is five months pregnant, said she was introduced to the factory by one of her friends. John disclosed that she received N2,000 every week for her upkeep.
