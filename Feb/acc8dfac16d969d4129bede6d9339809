Atletico Madrid manager, Diego Simeone, has said Luis Suarez will instill fear into Chelsea in their Champions League last-16 first leg on Tuesday. Suarez has scored 16 times since moving to Atletico from Barcelona. Simeone’s men now sit top of LaLiga, but the 33-year-old is yet to find the net in four Champions League matches for the club. During his four-year stint with Barcelona, Suarez only scored 10 times in the Champions League and has not netted in an away game in the competition since September 2015. “Luis generates fear in rivals no matter what competition it is,” Simeone told a news conference. “He has skills and qualities that attract a lot of attention from any rival. We’ll talk about his problems scoring away from home when we go to London, but tomorrow is a home game for us.”
