Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has called for state empowerment to control their internal security. Atiku made the call while condemning the abduction of 317 secondary schoolgirls in Jangebe, Zamfara State. He said that the Governor of Zamfara, H.E Bello Matawalle informed him that his government is doing everything to secure the release of the abducted students. Atiku stressed that the federal government cannot expect states to provide security of life and property in their domain, without giving them control over internal security. He tweeted, ”I have previously made recommendations on how our beloved nation can defeat enemies of the state and win the war on terror, and I stand by those suggestions. ”However, right now, all hands must be on deck to support the Zamfara state government in securing the release of those abducted. ”Thus, I call on the National and State Assemblies to begin the process of constitutional and legal reforms that will make this a reality. The Legislature must take the lead, as it seems the Executive may not be able to provide the needed leadership on this issue. ”My heart goes out to the families of the abducted children, and my right hand of fellowship is extended to Governor Matawalle, to help in any way possible.”
