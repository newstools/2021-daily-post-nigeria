The immediate past Governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode has revalidated his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ambode revalidated his membership at Epe ward A area of Lagos State, on Saturday. The revalidation is said to be Ambodeâ€™s first public appearance since 2019. Ambode had handed over to Babajide Sanwo-Olu as the governor of Lagos state on May 28, 2019. The former governor had to handover to Sanwo-Olu after one term due to a fallout with leaders of party in the state. Ambode lost his second term bid during APC primary election in the state.
