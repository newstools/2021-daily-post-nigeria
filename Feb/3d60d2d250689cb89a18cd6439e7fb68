Two defendants, Peter Obi(41) m and Ego Njoku (35) f, were, on Monday arraigned before an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court over alleged abduction. The defendants, of unknown addresses, are facing a charge of abduction. The prosecutor, Inspector Oriyomi Akinwale, told the court that the defendants committed the offence on Feb. 1 in Ado-Ekiti. Akinwale alleged that the defendants abducted one Falilat Isinekha, a 17-year-old girl without the consent of her parents. He said the defendants both deaf and dumb brought the girl, also deaf and dumb from Auchi, in Edo State, to Ado-Ekiti for the business of begging for alms. He added that they were apprehended and handed over to the police. According to him, the offence contravenes Section 27 (2) b of Child Rights Law, Ekiti State, 2012. The prosecutor asked the court for adjournment to enable him to study the case file and present his witnesses. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge preferred against them. Counsel to the defendants, Mr Michael Olaleye, urged the court to grant them bail, with a promise that they would not jump bail. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Adefumike Anoma, granted bail to the defendants in the sum of N10,000 with one surety each in like sum. She adjourned the case till March 22 for hearing.
