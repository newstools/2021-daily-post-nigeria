Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has finally reacted to reports linking midfielder, Juan Mata, with a move away from Old Trafford. Reports had emerged earlier this week that Juventus, AS Roma and Inter Milan, were all keeping a keen eye on Mata. Mata’s contract with Man United will expire at the end of the season. Nevertheless, the Red Devils have the option of extending his contract by a further 12 months. Reacting to the development on Wednesday, Solskjaer said during his pre-match press conference ahead of Man United’s Europa League last-32 second leg tie with Real Sociedad on Thursday night that he was not surprised that Mata is being linked with a move away from the club. According to the Norwegian, the 32-year-old Spaniard is an outstanding footballer and a fantastic professional. “I’m not surprised that teams are interested in him [Mata],” Solskjaer said. “One, he’s a very good footballer, two, he’s a fantastic professional and human being. When the contracts are running towards the end, there will be interest. I’m sure Juan has been able to speak to other clubs if he wants to. “I keep in touch with him all the time anyway. We have a good dialogue.”
