The Abia State Government has slammed the senator representing Kogi West Senatorial District, Senator Smart Adeyemi for allegedly referring to the State governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu as a “champagne drinking Governor”. In a statement issued on Monday by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Onyebuchi Ememanka, Abia the state government said the Senator made the comment on Monday while the Senate was debating on a motion on how to protect schools across the country. “Our view is that the Senator is either suffering from a protracted case of mental illness or is battling with occasional fits of schizophrenia which manifests in making careless, dishonorable, unrelated and incoherent statements. “This conclusion becomes irresistible judging from the total disconnect between the matter being discussed by the Senate and the comments made by the Senator as they affect the Governor,” Onyebuchi stated. According to the statement, Abia Government alleged that the Senator was not in sound mind, adding that Abia State is miles ahead of the Adeyemi’s home state (Kogi). Ikpeazu’s CPS stated that since his principal assumed office as a governor, there has not been one single case of attack on any school anywhere in the state. “Senator Smart Adeyemi is clearly non compos mentis. If not, he would have known that while his State is still awarding contracts for the renovation of schools, Abia had long completed more than 500 classroom projects scattered across schools in Abia State, and still counting. “It is obvious that Senator Adeyemi is battling with acute dementia and has lost every of his instincts as a journalist. If not, he would have known that just last week, the National Bureau of Statistics adjudged Abia State as No. 3 on the list of States that attracted foreign direct investments, with only Lagos and Abuja ahead of Abia State in the entire country”, Onyebuchi added.
