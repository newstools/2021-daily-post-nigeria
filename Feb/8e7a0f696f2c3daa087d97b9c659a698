Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, has revalidated his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Yola, Adamawa State. At an Old GRA registration venue in Jimeta where he entered his name in the party’s fresh registration book at about 4pm on Friday, Boss Mustapha told newsmen that the APC was wise in asking its old members to revalidate their membership and for new members to be duly registered. “We are refreshing the party by bringing new members and asking old members to renew their membership,” the SGF said. Giving further justification for the exercise, he said, “In the course of the last six years, so many things have happened. We cannot claim that all of us who started the party are still with us. I commend the leadership for this exercise. It is important for us to know how many we are.” He urged Adamawa people to come out in their large numbers and register as members of the APC. “This exercise will determine what happens in 2023 and the more distant future. We need a solid membership base,” he said. Asked of what he foresees for the APC in 2023 in Adamawa State, Boss Mustapha enthused that the party will retake the state. “Adamawa was an APC state. We know the mistakes that cost us the state in 2019 and we’ve learnt from them. They will guide our future. We’ll redeem our fate and get Adamawa back as an APC state,” Boss Mustapha asserted.
