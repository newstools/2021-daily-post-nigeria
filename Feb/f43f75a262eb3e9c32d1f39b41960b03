Popular Nigerian Comedian, Debo Adebayo, known as Mr Macaroni has been arrested at the Lekki toll gate, alongside other protesters. Macaroni confirmed this on his Instagram live session in a black maria before the police seized their phones. DAILY POST reported earlier that the police deployed its operatives to the toll gate on Friday Macaroni said the decision to reopen the toll gate is the height of disrespect to those who lost their lives. He said: “In a circular, the attorney general stated that everyone has a right to protest but observe COVID-19 protocols “You are saying it’s our right but you’re restricting us.You’ll be arrested if you’re at the toll gate. I’m doing this live to show you that some of us have been arrested. “The democracy our governors, president are enjoying some people fought for it. Let us know if we are in a military regime. “As a president how on earth will you think the opening of toll gate is on of the things to do, till now what justice has come out from that panel. You are bullying youth representatives at the panel. How on earth do you think opening this toll gate is the next line of action.”
