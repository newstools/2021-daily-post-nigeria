The Police have urged Nigerians to divulge useful information that could assist in the rescue of abducted Zamfara schoolgirls. The Force Headquarters said a search-and-rescue operation for the 300 students of Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe, had commenced. The Force Police Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, in a statement said ground and aerial assets had been deployed to find the captives. He said the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu, had ordered the immediate deployment of two operational surveillance helicopters to Zamfara. He added that the deployment was reinforcement for personnel of Operation Puff Adder II earlier deployed in the state. Mba said the move was to support the Police Command in Zamfara to combat banditry, kidnapping and other related crimes. The police spokesman said Adamu condemned the barbaric and callous abduction of the female students. Mba said the joint rescue operation was being carried out with the military, other security agencies, Zamfara State government and key stakeholders.
