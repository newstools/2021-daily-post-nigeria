The Commissioner of Police, Akwa Ibom State Command, CP Amiengheme Andrew, has vowed to apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of jungle justice. The Commissioner stated this following the rising cases of jungle justice in Akwa Ibom State. In a press statement signed by the Command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Odiko MacDon, the Commissioner described jungle justice as a travesty of justice adding that an innocent person could be killed in the process. The statement read in parts, “The Commissioner of Police Akwa Ibom State, *CP AMIENGHEME ANDREW, fdc* is piqued by the recent increase in the resort to jungle justice by some irate Mob in the State. “The Commissioner of Police notes that jungle justice is a travesty of justice, as it does not guarantee fairness to anyone and may lead to the death of an innocent person(s). “He sees the act as a descent into the Hobbesian state of anarchy and will therefore not be tolerated as it negates the subsisting constitutional provisions and has no place in our criminal justice administration.” The CP appealed to members of the public to be law-abiding and always handover suspected criminals when caught to the Police for prosecution.
