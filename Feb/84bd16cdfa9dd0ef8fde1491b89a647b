Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, on Tuesday, declared that anybody arrested for kidnapping, banditry and other forms of criminalities would be prosecuted. Osinbajo spoke during the revalidation of his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), at ward 1, Unit 3, Egunrege, Ikenne, in Ikenne Local Government Area of Ogun, NAN reports. He called for inter-ministerial collaboration in ensuring the arrest and prosecution of criminals. According to Osinbajo: “What we must ensure is prosecution of all those who have been arrested for kidnapping, banditry and all other forms of criminalities. “There must be evidence that justice is being done. “This is achievable by stronger collaboration between the police, states’ Ministries of Justice and the Federal Ministry of Justice. “With the new Service Chiefs, we have a fresh set of eyes, intellect, skills and a fresh look at strategies against the insurgency in the North East as well as banditry and kidnapping elsewhere. “In this new approach much greater emphasis is being placed on technology for surveillance, intelligence gathering and attack,” he said.
