Arsenal has been handed a significant injury boost ahead of their Europa League round of 32 clash with Benfica at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome on Thursday. Arsenal defender, Kieran Tierney, who didn’t take part in the club’s Premier League 4-2 victory over Leeds United on Sunday due to injury, returned to the Gunners’ training on Tuesday ahead of their clash with Benfica. Tierney missed the last month encounter due to leg injury, but the club disclosed his return in a tweet posted on Tuesday. A video of a small-sided game showed the Scottish international in action, and the 23-year-old curled home a fine goal to show that he could well be over the worst of his injury. Providing an update on Tierney, Arteta told a post-match press conference after Arsenal defeated Leeds last weekend, “It seems unlikely at the moment, but I don’t know. “Probably if there is one player who has got a bigger chance, it’s Kieran [Tierney]. “Probably in the next few days, he can start to do some parts with the team.” “It seems unlikely [on Partey] at the moment,” he said.
