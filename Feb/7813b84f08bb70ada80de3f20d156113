Governor of Adamawa State, Rt Hon Ahmadu Fintiri, has banned the use of tricycles, also known as keke and motorcycles, popularly known as okada at night in and around the state capital, Yola. The ban, which takes immediate effect, is between 10 pm and 5am and affects Yola North, Yola South and Girei Local Government Areas. A statement released late on Tuesday by Mr Humwashi Wonosikou, Press Secretary to Governor Fintiri, said the governor signed the ‘Adamawa State Restriction of Movement of Tricycles/Motorcycles Executive Order No.1 of 2021’ to take effect on Tuesday 2nd February, 2021 until further notice. Wonosikou said Governor Fintiri expressed concern “over the activities of hoodlums disturbing the peace of the state,” and vowed that the government will not leave any stone unturned towards protecting the lives and property of innocent citizens. According to Wonosikou, Fintiri described the activities of such miscreants as unacceptable, stressing, “They have become an extraordinary threat to the peace, wellbeing, security and stability of the state’s political and economic systems, as well as a negative effect on continuous development, and must therefore be effectively curtailed.” By the prescription of the executive order, anyone found guilty is liable to six months imprisonment with an option of N100,000 fine or both. Anyone thus sentenced is also to forfeit his tricycle or motorcycle to the government. The executive order however exempts people seeking medical attention or providing assistance to the vulnerable or going to work as essential service personnel.
