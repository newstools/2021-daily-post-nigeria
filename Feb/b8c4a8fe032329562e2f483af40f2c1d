The Presidency has revealed the position of President Muhammadu Buhari on the issue of killer herdsmen in the country. Buhari’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina said the president’s position is that those found with arms unlawfully should be arrested and prosecuted. Adesina disclosed this while responding to a question from Seun Okinbaloye on Channels Television’s programme, Politics Today. According to Adesina: “If the governor would say he has not heard the president speak on that matter that is what he should make clear, it’s not that the president has not spoken. “Because a number of times the president has spoken on that issue and his position has always been the same, anybody who carries arms unlawfully should be arrested and prosecuted. The president has said it countless times and that is the position. “No matter who he is or wherever he comes from criminality is criminality, anybody bearing arms unlawfully must be arrested, prosecuted and that is the position of the president.” This is coming at a time when the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom had said he petitioned Buhari on the activities of killer herdsmen. Ortom had stated this while calling for the arrest of Miyetti Allah leaders.
