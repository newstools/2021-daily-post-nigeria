The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, on Thursday, prayed the Federal High Court, Abuja, to allow the police to investigate ex-Minister of State for Education, Kenneth Gbagi, over alleged staff abuse. Gbagi was accused ordering four of his staff to be stripped naked and photographed over a theft case at his hotel, Signatious Hotel in Effurun, Delta. On September 30, 2020, Gbagi filed a fundamental rights application before Justice Taiwo Taiwo, seeking an order to restrain the police and others from arresting or detaining him. NAN reports that in a counter affidavit filed by counsel to the I-G and Delta State Commissioner of Police, Lukman Fagbemi, the police said that based on petitions, it was duty bound to invite Gbagi to answer questions. The security agency told the court that the petitions protested how Gbagi allegedly ordered three female and one male staff to be unclothed and photographed by his son, Egba Gbagi. “That the said petition further alleged that the applicant in this case directed his said son to post the said nude picture on the internet after the same had been taken by his son which he did by molesting and dehumanising the person of those male and female staff. “The copy of the said picture is attached as EXHIBIT B,” Fagbemi noted. Justice Taiwo adjourned the case until March 11 for hearing. The strip of the workers sparked outrage after the photos circulated on social media. Nigerians and civil society organizations demanded that the police probe and prosecute Gbagi and his son.
