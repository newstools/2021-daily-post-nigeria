The Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly, Timothy Owoeye has urged the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to be mature in picking its flagbearer for the 2023 presidential election. DAILY POST reports that Owoeye made this known in a brief remark on Monday while revalidating his membership of the party in Unit 6, Ward 10, Ilesha East Local Government Area of the State. The lawmaker recalled that the euphoria which greeted the formation of the APC in 2013 was one of hope and greatness for Nigeria. The Speaker who compared the merger of the ACN, CPC, ANPP and the eventual fusion of the nPDP to that of corporate conglomerates in the business world, reiterated that the coming together was as a result of a series of round table discussions where agreements were made and interests protected. In his words, “I have studied the undercurrent for the 2023 elections and the position of the National Executives, I charge the party to imbue the spirit of maturity we had in 2013, agree and decide on who the drivers of our vehicle will be.
“We must rejig the euphoria we had in 2013 and strive to ensure that this vehicle (APC) continues on the journey until we reach the destination of making Nigeria an enviable country in the comity of nations. “The APC is a great party with great plans for this country and its citizens. Have we delivered on our promises? Not really! But we have begun a credible process that we must collectively strive to sustain.” Owoeye urged his supporters to go out and encourage people to join the APC adding that the party has a chance to bring in a new set of young people with modern ideals in line with global democratic tenets and standards.
