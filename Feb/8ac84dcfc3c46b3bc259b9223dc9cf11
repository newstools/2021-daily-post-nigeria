The Chief Press Secretary to the Benue State Governor, Mr Terver Akase has assured people of the state that his principal’s administration will not relent in its commitment to curbing the trafficking of children to other states to perform odd jobs. Akase made the assertion while speaking on TVC live programme on Monday. He described child trafficking as modern-day slavery. Reacting to the recent repatriation of 19 boys who were trafficked to Lagos, Mr Akase said Governor Samuel Ortom is concerned about the welfare of every Benue person within and outside the state, assuring that the present administration would continue to collaborate with all stakeholders in matters of security. He stated that in 2019, Governor Ortom visited Lagos State and held a meeting with the Benue community in that state where one of the main issues discussed was the menace of Benue children being trafficked to Lagos and other states. According to him, the Governor solicited the support of Benue indigenes in Lagos to enable his administration stop the ugly trend. Mr Akase appreciated the Non-governmental organisation and others whose efforts led to the rescue of the 19 boys and their repatriation to the state and called for greater synergy between the state and private organizations. The Governor’s spokesman advised Benue youths to be wary of those who come with lofty promises of jobs to lure them out of the state and subject them to hard labour.
