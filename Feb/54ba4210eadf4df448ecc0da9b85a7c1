Cristiano Ronaldo and his girlfriend, Georgina Rodriguez are left heartbroken after their £2,600 cat, Pepe, was left close to death after being hit by a car. The Sphynx pet was run over after escaping Ronaldo’s luxury home in Turin, Italy the former Real Madrid star shared with Georgina, a supermodel. Georgina, who shared the news on social media, revealed that the scary-looking Pepe has been sent to Spain for recovery after time in intensive care. Georgina, 27, flew Pepe on Ronaldo’s private jet to Madrid to continue its rehabilitation. Pepe was named after Cristiano Ronaldo’s Brazilian-born Portugal and ex-Real Madrid teammate currently lacing his boots for FC Porto. The bald puss became part of Ronaldo and Georgina’s family just over two years ago and has enjoyed luxury holidays with them. The 36-year-old Juventus striker was once filmed playing with it as he laid in his front in a T-shirt and underpants while his partner massaged his calf muscles. Georgina sparked pregnancy rumours last May by dressing the cat up as a baby and taking a picture of it being kissed by Cristiano’s three-year-son Mateo. The supermodel revealed the cat’s condition in an interview with Spanish magazine Instyle, saying: “Pepe has given us a terrible scare. “It escaped from home and was run over. “It was close to death and after a month and a half in intensive care at the vet’s, we’ve decided my sister Ivana should look after it. “Pepe’s now in Spain recovering.” Georgina, who has a three-year-old daughter with Cristiano called Alana Martina and is the day-to-day mum of his other three children, added: “The youngest ones didn’t understand Pepe was sick and wanted to play with him. “Now he’s in the best hands.”
