The Nigeria Labour Congress NLC, Kano Chapter, has waded into the debacle between thousands of Tricycles riders and the state government, calling on them to quickly call off the two days old industrial action they embarked on. Having reached an amicable resolution to the strike, leading to the end of the two days strike action, the NLC State Chairman, Comrade Kabiru Ado Minjibir, said all Tricycles riders are to pay a token of N100 daily tax as provided by the State Revenue Board Laws. That the first payment of N100 should be done through REMITER to enable data captured in Kamo Revenue Board/KARATO Cyber, which will be done within two weeks effective from 23rd of February 2021. Kabiru Ado Minjibir said after the first payment of N100 through REMITER subsequent payments for Tricycles can be done through their androids phones or POS on an option of daily payment, monthly, quarterly or yearly. He said they have already contacted hire purchase Owners to assist the Tricycles riders in the provision of additional remitter points to enable members to make payment with ease. The State Managing Director of the State Road Agency, Baffa Babba Danagundi said the government has accepted the resolution and are ready to work on it.
