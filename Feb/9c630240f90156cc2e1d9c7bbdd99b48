Constitutional lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, SAN, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to withdraw the extension of Inspector-General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu’s tenure. The human rights lawyer noted that the President’s decision to retain Adamu in the position is illegal. President Buhari on Thursday extended the tenure of Adamu for three months. The Minister of Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi made this known while briefing State House correspondents at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Dingyadi said that Buhari’s decision to retain the IGP for another three months was to properly select the new helmsman. But appearing on Channels Television on Thursday evening, Ozekhome said that in “the eye of the law, there is no Inspector-General of Police. “What we have there is a retired Inspector-General of Police illegally occupying the office – “Mr President sir, withdraw the appointment of Mr. Adamu. Call your Police Council and appoint from one of the serving AIGs. “In the eye of the law, Adamu is a retired police officer…you’re denying other members of the Nigeria Police Force who are aspiring to go up to become the Inspector-General. “The President was wrong… it is illegal, unconstitutional, unconscionable, whimsical… Adamu has done his best for the country.”
