The Police in Osun on Monday arraigned four persons in an Osogbo Chief Magistrate Court for alleged possession of Indian Hemp known as Cannabis Sativa. The defendants include Adelokun Mosuru, 20, Aderanti Azeez, 26, Shittu Amodu, 33, and Agbaje Paul, 42. The police prosecutor, Inspector Adeoye Kayode, told the court that the defendants committed the offence on Feb. 4, at about 11:00pm, Abaku Area, Osogbo. Kayode said the accused persons conspired among themselves to engage in smoking Indian hemp otherwise known as cannabis sativa. â€œThe defendants were apprehended in a hideout as a result of an information received by an informant and the situation led to breach of public peace before the intervention of the police. The prosecutor said the offence contravened section 249(d) of the criminal code cap 34 vol. 11, Laws of Osun, 2002. The defendants pleaded not guilty to a count charge of unlawful possession against them. The Defense Counsel, Mr. Najite Okobie, prayed the court to grant his clients bail in the most liberal terms. The Magistrate, Mr. Isola Omisade, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N200, 000 and one surety each in the likesum. Omisade said the sureties must reside within the court jurisdiction with evidence of tax payment and three passports sized photographs, attached with an affidavit of means. The case was adjourned to March 18th for hearing.
