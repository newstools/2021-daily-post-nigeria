Barcelona defender, Gerard Pique has talked about his relationship with Real Madrid players, including Sergio Ramos. Pique also talked about his relationship with for Real superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo, saying he even has the Portuguese shirt. In an interview with United Post, the legendary Spanish defender also discussed Lionel Messi’s contract. Messi has not held talks with any other clubs despite being free to discuss a contract elsewhere, while Ramos is engaged in a contract stand-off with the LaLiga champions. “I talk to him, but not about his renewal,” Pique said of Ramos. “We get along very well. With Madrid, the relationship is very good. “I have swapped shirts with them and I have Madrid shirts at home. I have Cristiano [Ronaldo], [Karim] Benzema, Ramos… a few. But putting one on is too far for me.” On Ramos and Messi’s decisions, Pique insists that players hold excessive power in the modern game. “I don’t think so. They have stature and can give their opinion and, from there, decisions can go one way or another,” he said. “When you have a board of directors or a president who is very strong, who have clear ideas, the player has little to say. “Sergio is an example, with the contract talks he is having: when there is a strong president who makes a decision and wants to take that path, the players can’t do much.”
