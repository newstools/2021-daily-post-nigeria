The Osun State Command of the Nigerian Police has denied news that EndSARS protest was held in the State, particularly in Osogbo. The command, which spoke through its Police Public Relations Officer, SP Yemisi Opalola said the Commissioner of Police had on Friday night mobilised police personnel to all strategic and flash points within the State. She also disclosed that it was while the Commissioner of Police was out for morning patrol that they encountered a church which was having an outdoor programme earlier planned for today. The PPRO noted that the CP advised them to adhere the COVID-19 guidelines and avoid crowd congestion. Meanwhile, in a chat with DAILY POST, Mr. Ayo Ologun, a journalist and a civil right activist disclosed that he was reliably informed there was protest in Osogbo in the morning, where about 200 youths gathered between Freedom Park (Old Garage) and Olaiya Junction. He claimed that the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Olawale Olokode engaged the protesters. According to him, the CP made the protesters realise that they had a right to protest but that it must be done as peacefully as possible. He also said he believed the protest in Osogbo was in solidarity with the ongoing protest at the Lekki Tollgate. A visit by DAILY POST to some parts of Osogbo like Olaiya, Gbeemu and Jaleyemi Junctions, Freedom Park (Old Garage), Oke-Fia and Lameco roundabouts, Igbona and Ogo-Oluwa revealed the presence of police personnel. Also, it was observed that most businesses, especially at the Osun Mall located at Fakunle Area of the state capital did not open their doors for business early.
