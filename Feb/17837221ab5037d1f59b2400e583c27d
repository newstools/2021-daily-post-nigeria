Celestine Okoye, a retired Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police has joined the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State. Anambra governorship election will hold on November 6. The former officer registered at his Polling Unit, Ward 3 in Awka, the state capital, on Thursday. Okoye said he was happy to have served Nigeria and that it was time to help build the society through active politics. He promised to work for the party’s victory in the November 6 governorship election. “My reason for joining APC is clear; Anambra and South-East cannot continue to be in the opposition”, NAN quoted him as saying.” Okoye noted that Anambra and Igbo people needed to be with the platform controlling the federal government. “We have to stop playing mushroom politics with parties that cannot lead us to anywhere,” he said.
