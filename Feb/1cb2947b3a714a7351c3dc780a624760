Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau State has said none of his political appointees has the right to refuse participating in the ongoing nationwide membership registration and revitalization in the All Progressives Congress (APC). While receiving the party’s delegation to the state on Monday, the governor charged all members of the State Executive Council to participate in the exercise “Please members of the executives, do your best, go back and revalidate your membership of the party,’’ he said. “This is what I expect from every stakeholder, I have told them already that nobody under my appointment has any licence to say, no, I would not register. He urged those yet to register with the party to take advantage of the exercise, adding that doing so would revalidate their appointments. “If you do not want to revalidate your membership, then you are telling us you belong to the other side,’’ he said. Lalong who lauded President Muhammadu Buhari’s commitment to ensuring the success of the registration said the gesture would strengthen the party for tasks ahead.
