Manchester United has confirmed that winger, Facundo Pellistri, has left Old Trafford to join Spanish club, Alaves on loan for the remainder of the 2020/21 season. Man United made the announcement in a statement via its website on Sunday ahead of their Premier League clash with Southampton on Tuesday. The statement read in part: “We wish Facundo all the best for his spell with Alaves in Spain, and look forward to following his progress.” Pellistri, 19, signed a five-year contract with Man United in the summer of 2020. He made a series of impressive appearances for Man United’s Under-23s side over the last few months. Reacting, Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, told Man United’s official website: “Our scouts have followed Facundo for a long time and we believe that he’ll be a real talent for the long term. “Whilst we understand it’ll take time for him to adapt to the English game, he is capable of having an impact with his pace and ability to beat his opponent.”
