Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has provided the latest update on Winger, Gareth Bale, ahead of his side’s Premier League clash against Manchester City on Saturday evening. Mourinho also confirmed that Gio Lo Celso and Sergio Reguilon would take no part in Tottenham’s squad to face Pep Guardiola’s side at Etihad. Recall that Bale missed Tottenham’s FA Cup fifth-round 5-4 defeat against Everton at Goodison Park on Wednesday due to injury. “Serge Aurier, maybe he can play [against Man City], I don’t know. We still have one more training session to see. Sergio Reguilon, no chance. Gio Lo Celso, no chance. I would say Reguilon has a chance to play Europa League next week,” Mourinho told a pre-match press conference on Friday. Mourinho added: “No new injuries. Sergio, not even close. Gareth [Bale], we have a training session in the afternoon to see if he feels ready or not.” The kick-off time for Man City vs Tottenham is 6:30 pm.
