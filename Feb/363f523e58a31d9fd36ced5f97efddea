President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday met with Abdulrasheed Bawa, the newly confirmed Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. Also in attendance was the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami. They met behind closed-doors at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. As at the time of filing this report, the agenda of the meeting was still unknown. Buhari had a few weeks ago nominated Bawa as the substantive Chairman of the EFCC. Following his nomination, the Senate on Wednesday confirmed Bawa as substantive Chairman of the anti-graft agency Bawa takes over from Ibrahim Magu following his removal from office in July 2020 on allegations of corruption. Malami had accused Magu of mismanaging recovered loot while he was EFCC Chairman.
