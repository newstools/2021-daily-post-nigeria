Former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Atletico Madrid to beat Chelsea in tonight’s Champions League last-16 first-leg fixture at the National Arena in Bucharest, Romania. Owen also predicted Bayern Munich to defeat Lazio at the Stadio Olimpico in Italy. Providing his predictions, Owen told BetVictor: “Over the last decade, Atletico have missed out on both the domestic championship and Champions League on several occasions, and this is another season where opportunity has presented itself at their door. “That said, they are in the middle of a patchy run of form, having won only once in four games. “Still undefeated, Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel is likely to approach this cautiously. The Blues’ have been solid at the back since his arrival, and I think this will be another match where he will be desperate to give nothing away. “With that in mind, I don’t see many goals on the horizon. However, I think Atletico may just have enough to nick it on their own patch. Atletico Madrid 1, Chelsea 0.” Speaking on the Lazio vs Bayern Munich game, Owen said: “This has the look of a great knockout tie and whilst I think Lazio can cause Bayern problems, I expect the visitors to just have enough to take the lead back to the Allianz Arena. It’s 2-0 Bayern for me. Lazio 0, Bayern 2.” The kick-off time for all the games is 9 pm, Nigerian time.
