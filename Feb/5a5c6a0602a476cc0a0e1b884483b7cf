Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, has maintained that Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State is not a terrorist. Fani-Kayode said describing Mohammed as a terrorist was unacceptable, erroneous and absurd. Mohammed was tagged a terrorist following his defence of herdsmen carrying arms. However, the former minister stated that Mohammed stands for Christians, Southerners and Middle Belters as much as he defends Northern Muslims. The former minister pointed out that Christians in Bauchi State are living peacefully. In a series of tweets, Fani-Kayode wrote: “We must choose our battles wisely and know who our real enemies are. I have disagreed with my friend and brother Gov. Bala Mohammed on several occasions over the years and I do not share his views on a number of issues but to describe him as a terrorist is uncharitable and absurd. “If you are looking for a terrorist Governor, I can name one or two but Bala is not amongst them. “To call Bala a terrorist is unacceptable and erroneous. I doubt that has ever killed a chicken, let alone a human being.”
