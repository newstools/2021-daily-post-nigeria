No fewer than twelve kidnap victims, mostly women have regained their freedom from bandits operating in Bungudu Local Government Area of Zamfara State. Their release came barely a few days after three notorious bandits surrendered their arms to the state government, having accepted the state’s peace and reconciliation initiative. Zamfara Governor, Bello Matawalle expressed satisfaction over the development and assured that his administration would continue to negotiate with bandits until peace is restored in the state. He stressed that dialogue with bandits remains the only option for peace. “I have vowed I will do everything within my power to continue with the ongoing peace and reconciliation deal aimed at ensuring that more bandits accept peace” he added. DAILY POST reports that the victims expressed gratitude to the Matawalle administration for being proactive in ensuring that kidnapped victims regained freedom, Governor Matawalle has, however, called on all indigenes of Zamfara to disregard the empty propaganda by enemies of peace saying his administration cannot achieve any peace while dialoguing with bandits. “Not that the government and security operatives cannot engage the bandits on fire for fire operation but there would be loss of innocent lives that the government and security operatives are trying to protect” The Governor urged the unrepentant bandits to embrace the ongoing peace and reconciliation initiative, saying that no meaningful development can take place anywhere without the presence of peace.
