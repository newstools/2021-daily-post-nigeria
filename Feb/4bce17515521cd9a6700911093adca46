The Governor of Ebonyi State, Chief David Umahi, on Tuesday, explained why he had to chase people from venue of the coronation of the Minister for Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, at Uburu community in Ohaozara LGA of the state. Umahi, who denied having any political feud with the minister, Onu, berated some persons in the community for peddling fake news. Recall that Ogbonnaya Onu was selected by the monarchs of Uburu Adu kingdom to be awarded the highest traditional title “Onyiba” but there was alleged attempt to truncate it by boys allegedly loyal to the government. But, Umahi while addressing the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Mr. Uche Ogah during a courtesy visit that took place at the new governor’s lodge, Centenary City Abakaliki, said Onu had issues with former ambassadors not him. “Some people are very much interested in fake news, I never had any issues with Dr. Onu, not even for once, he was actually the one and the former Ambassadors, having issues with the traditional rulers and so much youths there. “I was passing on a project inspection and had to get in there and ask everyone to vacate the premises because that is the place I’m constructing. “I have to save lives first, they were all hired to do that, I still have to accompany him to his residence. “So, why will one of you now write that I was having issues with him (Onu) and then that the minister boycotted a function that never held?” he queried.
