Arch. Bala Barnabas Bantex, a former deputy governor of Kaduna State, between 2015 to 2019 says his relationship with Governor Nasir El-Rufai remains cordial. “I still meet with my former boss frequently, who makes sure that l am kicking fine,” the former deputy governor revealed. The former deputy governor, who has gone into a quiet life since 2019, hardly speaks publicly. But during a brief encounter with newsmen, Bantex assured that he still enjoyed lots of goodwill and respect from governor Nasir El-Rufai. He reassured, “It is not possible to be a Deputy Governor to the State Governor, Nasir El-Rufa’i, and be finished.” Commenting on the series of engagements by the APC in the state, Arch. Bantex, who was at the Southern Kaduna All Progressives Congress, APC, stakeholders’ engagement committee meeting, noted that, “for some of you, you think I am finished for 2-years out of government, I am still kicking.” The former deputy governor explained that his interest was so minute, assuring that nothing can be compared to the interest of Kaduna State. He clarified, “I meet with the governor frequently and he makes sure that I am kicking.” Bantex, a grassroots mobilizer, resigned as Deputy Governor in 2019 to contest the Southern Kaduna Senatorial seat but lost to the incumbent Senator of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.
