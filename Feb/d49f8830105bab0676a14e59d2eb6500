Arsenal’s round of 32 Europa League clash with Benfica, could be played as a one-off tie on a neutral ground, under new UEFA rules, the UK Mirror reports. The two-leg tie is facing difficulties, because of the new COVID-19 rules in the UK that affects arrivals from Portugal. The rules would require Arsenal players and staff to quarantine for 10 days when they return from the first leg and also stop Benfica from entering the UK for the second leg. One solution would be for the game to be played at a neutral venue, a scenario UEFA’s competition regulations for the Champions League and Europa League knockout phases permit. Under rule K.1.8 of the respective competitions’ rule books, it states, “The UEFA administration has the right to assign an alternative venue for any particular match or even to decide that either or both legs of the relevant round to be rescheduled and/or played in a neutral country and/or organized as a single leg.”
