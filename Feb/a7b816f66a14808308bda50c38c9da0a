President Muhammadu Buhari has endorsed the peace efforts of Governor Bello Matawalle and has promised a better approach to security operations in the country. The President spoke through a special delegation of four Ministers under the leadership of the Minister of Aviation Hadi Sirika who were in Gusau, Zamfara state capital to commiserate with the Government and people of Zamfara State over the abduction of Jangebe school girls. Senator Sirika said the President is happy with Governor Matawalle over his genuine efforts at finding peace and tranquillity in the state. President Muhammadu Buhari, however, noted that the Military leadership is rejigged to improve their output which is going to make a better impact on the security situation in the country. In his response, Governor Bello Mohammed Matawallen Maradun thanked the President for his concern and said that the people of Zamfara state appreciate his concern and care as a father. “Since then, he has asked me to keep in touch with his Chief of Staff whom we have since been in touch with over this incidence. We are grateful to this concern and the immediate actions being taken”, Matwalle noted. He noted the President’s rejigging of the Military leadership can only succeed if they work in synergy to ensure ultimate results. ‘If the Air Force and Army will work independently without synergy, no meaningful result can be achieved in this fight. They must be made to work as an entity. That is how we can make progress’, Matawalle observed. He promised that his administration is working round the clock to ensure that the GGSS Jangebe students are rescued unscathed. Those on the President’s delegation are the leader of the team, Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, the Minister for Police affairs Alhaji Muhammadu Maigari Dingyadi, the Minister for Women Affairs, Mrs Paulin Tallen and the Minister for Humanitarian and Disaster Management and Social Development Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq.
