The Presidency on Monday said that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration would never tamper with press freedom in the country. Mr Femi Adesina, the President’s spokesman, said this while responding to the allegation that the government shut down an online news platform, Peoples Gazette. Adesina, who refuted the claims, said the present government would never tamper with the independence of the media. He spoke on Arise TV, The Morning Show on Monday. According to Adesina, “This government never clamped down on the media. It has never done, and will never do. “This government will never tamper with the independence of the media, and freedom of the press. “Peoples gazette is a paper that lies every day. It has lied against me and has lied against several people. So why should we bother ourselves against a platform that’s full of lies?”
