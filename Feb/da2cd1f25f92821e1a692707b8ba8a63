The Amirah of Al-Akhwaatul Muslimah Organisation in Oyo State, Alhaja Bashirat Ashim has explained that the usage of Hijab by Muslim women is not a fashion. Ashim who spoke in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital on Tuesday, maintained that Hijab usage is a dress code in Islam. She spoke during a program to commemorate the 2021 World Hijab Day in the state. DAILY POST reports that Governor Seyi Makinde of the state was represented by his Special Adviser on Islamic Affairs, Alhaji AbdRasheed AbdAzeez at the event. Ashim while speaking, expressed confidence that the occasion would encourage more Muslim women to embrace wearing of Hijab. She said, “The Hijab is not fashion but a dress code to encourage morals in Muslim women. “The celebration is also aimed at addressing the issue of discrimination face by Muslim women in our society in some occasions. According to the Amirah, wearing of Hijab has nothing to do with social vices such as the Boko Haram insurgency in our society as believed by some people. She then commended Makinde for identifying with Muslims across the state and for creating the enabling environment for them to thrive in their activities. AbdAzeez while speaking at the event, stressed the importance of Hijab as a pride of believing women. “As the good character of the regular users will serve as a motivating factor for others to join them”. He said the Governor had done a lot for Muslims before he came into office and would give what is due to Muslims now that he is at the helm of affairs. AbdulAzeez called on people especially the politicians to desist from the campaign of calumny and engage in constructive criticism to enhance the development of the State.
