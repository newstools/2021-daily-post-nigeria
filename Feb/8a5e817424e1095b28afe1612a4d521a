Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has said that he does not visit President Muhammadu Buhari to seek solution to insecurity in his State. Bello said he would rather sit down with stakeholders in his state to proffer solutions than paying lip service by visiting the President in Abuja. Speaking on Channels Television, Bello stressed that he does not pay lip service, adding that stakeholders in the state collaborate with security agencies to analyse intelligence to forestall the breakdown of law and order. “The Nigeria Police that are in the country today are the same in Kogi State. The Army in the country is the same in Kogi State. All the law enforcement agencies we have in the country today are exactly what I have in Kogi State. “So, when they provide such information, we act on it, we don’t pay lip service, we don’t pass buck, we don’t visit Abuja for solutions at all times. I don’t think there is any day I have ever visited Abuja for any solution. What I do is to sit down here and do my job,” the governor said. Speaking further, Gvernor Bello said there is a need for his counterparts from other states to collaborate and implement policies that will put an end to the herdsmen crisis in the country.
