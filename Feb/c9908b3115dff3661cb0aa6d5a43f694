A resident of Ughelli, Mr. Saturday Onajite has narrated how bullets came to lodge at the back of his head after an attack by armed robbers in Delta State. Onajite, a commercial motorcycle operator, said the robbers shot at him, disarmed him and went away with his motorcycle during an operation at Oberia street, Ughelli Community. The forty-nine-year-old man said the incident occurred at about 8am on Friday, February 5. Giving details of his ordeal to newsmen in Ughelli, the motorcyclist said he picked two passengers at the market road and conveyed them to Oberia street. “They said I should go to the corner and I did. The next thing I heard was a gunshot. They stole my bike and money. I could not know myself again because I was bleeding on the ground until people came to rush me to the hospital.” Onajite who still has bullets lodged at the back of his head said he spent over one hundred and thirty thousand Naira in the hospital for medical treatments and for attempts to remove the bullets from his head. Onajite said he has no idea the expenses his benefactor, the owner of the bike, may have incurred in the process of treating him, in addition to the stolen motorcycle. He lamented that there were still bullets in his head, according to his doctor but called on good spirited Nigerians to come to his aid financially as the bullets in his system have begun to cause him ill health. The shooting and robbing of Onajite is only one of the many criminal acts unleashed on residents of Ughelli by armed robbers, cultists and kidnappers.
