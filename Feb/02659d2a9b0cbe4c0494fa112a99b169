Alhaji Surajo Garba Maikatako, the chairman of Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa political movement in Zamfara State has alleged that some politicians induced him with millions of naira to abandon his political godfather, Kabiru Garba Marafa. Maikatako revealed this during a meeting with Marafa social media handlers on Thursday, saying that if he had accepted the inducement, he would have been out of the country and would have abandoned senator Marafa’s political struggle. He alleged that a lot of people in the Marafa political movement were also confronted with millions of naira, pointing out that some have chosen to accept the inducement while some have decided to remain steadfast with Senator Kabiru Marafa because of his political ideologies. “Not more than five out of over 100 social media handlers of Senator Marafa movement have decided to defect to the PDP due to alleged financial inducement and juicy political appointments. According to him, the ruling PDP in the state should celebrate senator Kabiru Marafa and his supporters after their reunification of governor Abdul Aziz Yari and senator Mafara’s factions.” On the allegation that Zamfara SSG has identified some supporters of Sen. Marafa for political appointments, Maikatako said, he never thought the seat of SSG is influential and capable of attracting appointments until when the SSG, Alhaji Bello Balls Maru began to scout for some opportunists for a political reason. He also accused the SSG of betraying Sen. Marafa who was the brain behind his appointment, noting that such is an experience in politics. It could be recalled that the SSG, Alhaji Bello Balls Maru was a loyalist of senator Kabiru Garba Marafa and was appointed the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) due to the government of unity initiated by governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle in the state.
