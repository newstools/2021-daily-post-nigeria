Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki and some leaders of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) visited former Head of State, Ibrahim Babangida, on Friday. The meeting was held at the IBB Hilltop residence in Minna, Niger State. Saraki is the Chairman of the PDP Reconciliation and Strategy Committee. The former Kwara Governor said the parley was a part of “engagements with influential leaders and stakeholders”. The committee, this week, had a meeting with former PDP governors. Saraki told reporters they discussed the future of the party as well as the 2023 general elections. The team was inaugurated late last year to reconcile warring leaders and factions.
