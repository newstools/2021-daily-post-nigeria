Real Madrid president, Florentino Pérez, has tested positive for COVID-19. The club made the announcement in a statement via its website on Tuesday afternoon. This is coming less than two weeks after Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, tested positive for coronavirus. Zidane had tested positive for the virus before Real Madrid’s away La Liga 4-1 win against Alaves on January 23. “Real Madrid CF communicates that our president Florentino Pérez has given a positive result in the COVID-19 tests to which he is subjected periodically, although he does not present any symptoms,” Real Madrid’s statement read. Perez will now be in isolation in the next couple of days.
