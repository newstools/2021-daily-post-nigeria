Lado said the displaced persons had been transverse across both the north and southern parts of the country. He said that President Muhammadu Buhari has continued support the Commission towards supporting the displaced population across the country, stressing that the Commission will continue to work assiduously in this regard. Lado explained that 7,500 displaced persons across 1,500 households would benefit from the gesture, which includes different variety of food and non-food items.
