The Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC), on Friday, apprehended four suspected kidnappers in Ibarapa area of Oyo state. The Oyo chapter led by Rotimi Olumo, confirmed that the Isiaka Muhammadu, the second in command to Wakilu, a dreaded kidnapper, was also arrested. OPC went on a search mission for Wakilu, who had been terrorising the area. “Muhammadu, who was arrested around 5pm, has given vital information that might lead to the arrest of the kingpin”, Olumo said. The four suspects have been handed over to the police. They are presently at the Ago ranger, Civil Defence headquarters in Igbo Ora. OPC expressed determination to rid the South-West region of kidnappers and other criminal elements.
