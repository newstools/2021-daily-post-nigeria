English television presenter and pundit, Alex Scott, has criticized Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta’s decision to start Martin Odegaard ahead of Emile Smith Rowe against Manchester City. Odegaard had a poor game and was replaced by Smith Rowe in the second half, but Scott believes Arteta should have started the England youngster ahead of the Real Madrid loanee. Arteta saw Man City defeated Arsenal at Emirates following Raheem Sterling’s early goal. “Today, you look at Odegaard. For me, he was bang average,” Scott told Sky Sports after the game. “And so you question the decision actually with Smith Rowe not being selected ahead of him. “I think we’re going to see his [Odegaard’s] real qualities over the next couple of weeks. “Is he good enough to be in this starting XI of Arsenal? Or actually, is this loan period going to be a short one?.”
