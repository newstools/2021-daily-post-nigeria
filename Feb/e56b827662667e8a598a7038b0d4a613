The Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry probing the alleged killing of End SARS protesters by soldiers at the Lekki tollgate in October 2020, has approved the reopening of the toll plaza. The panel on Saturday returned control of the Lekki toll gate plaza to its owners, the Lekki Concession Company (LCC). The Chairman of the panel, Justice Doris Okuwobi, delivered the ruling. Justice Okuwobi listened to arguments for and against the application made by Demola Seriki, counsel to the LCC Ltd, for the re-opening of the facility. It is the fourth time the LCC is making the application. The other four members who sat with Justice Okuwobi are DIG Taiwo Lakanu (representing the police), Lucas Koyejo (from the National Human Rights Commission), Segun Awosanya (Segalink) and Oluwatoyin Odusanya (Director, Citizenâ€™s Right). Seriki, in his arguments, asked the panel to allow LCC take possession of the toll gate plaza, for the purpose of evaluating the damage done so as to make insurance claims needed to effect the necessary repairs which he says will last about 2 months. Immediately after the panel ruling in his favour, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa walked in with the other three members of the panel, Patience Udoh (representing civil society), Rinuola Oduola and Temitope Majekodunmi (representing the youths). They then delivered dissenting decisions stating they were not in support of the repossession and the reopening of the Lekki toll plaza.
