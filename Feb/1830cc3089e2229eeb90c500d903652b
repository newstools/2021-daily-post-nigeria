Governor of Ebonyi State and the Chairman, Southeast Governors Forum, Dave Umahi has reiterated the ban on open grazing in the region. Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, had at the weekend given the Governors in the region seven days to join their South West counterparts in banning open grazing. But the Governor, while reacting to Kanu’s ultimatum, disclosed that the Governors did not just stop at banning open grazing but also restricted the movement of cattle by foot. Umahi spoke on Monday during the of the All Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders meeting in Abakaliki, the state capital. “Governors of South East have been calling on our leaders to speak out on the security of the zone and unity of Nigeria,” he said. “I read on paper where someone said he was giving Governors of South East 7-days to ban open grazing. “The Governors of southeast had banned open grazing and movement of cows by foot into South East, in each of States of the South East, we are managing ourselves well, what we discuss with the herdsmen is the system in place for a long time,” he said.
