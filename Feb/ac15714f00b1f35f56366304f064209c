Ex-Big Brother Naija housemate, Kiddwaya Terseer Waya, has finally confirmed that his relationship with fellow housemate, Erica Nlewedim is over. There have been reports on social media that the relationship between them had ended. Kiddwaya had last month revealed that he was trying to find love and that he doesn’t have a love life. Responding to a question and answer session with his fans on Instagram, Kiddwaya explained that he made the statement about being single because he wanted to keep their relationship private. He, however, revealed that his words were twisted and it complicated the issue. “She was my girlfriend at the time. I didn’t want people to be involved, I wanted it to be private, that’s why I said that and sadly my words got twisted and it brought a lot of drags. Positive vibes from now on please,” he said.
