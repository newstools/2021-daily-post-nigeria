Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said that his team will approach their Premier League clash against Manchester United from the experience of their last four weeks’ games. Tuchel explained that he would prepare Chelsea players for the clash, and hopefully, they will beat Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side at Stamford Bridge. According to him, the Man United game will be a big challenge for Chelsea because the Blues are on a good run. “We will underline our opinion and knowledge with pictures from the last four weeks, like always, and then we will prepare our team to win this match hopefully,” Tuchel said as quoted by Chelsea’s official website on Friday. “We will totally focus on us, what we have to do to win this difficult match. “There is a lot to do, but we are on a good run, and it will be a big challenge to be the first ones to beat them in a Premier League away game.” Chelsea head to the game after beating Atletico Madrid 1-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday night.
