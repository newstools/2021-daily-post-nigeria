Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has admitted that Paris Saint-Germain’s defeat to Manchester United in the last 16 of the Champions League, left him in a ‘dark place’. In March 2019, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side arrived at the Parc des Princes 2-0 down after a first-leg home defeat and amid an injury crisis. However, they went on to win 3-1 and qualify for the quarter-final. Tuchel faces Solskjaer again with Chelsea in the Premier League on Sunday, in a match that will have implications in the battle to finish in the top four. “I can be very honest after that match I was two days in a very dark place and I can tell you I was not able to speak to anybody and to think about anything else [other] than this defeat,” Tuchel told reporters ahead of Sunday’s clash. “That was maybe the worst defeat that I experienced because it came from nowhere. In the circumstances that it arrived, I was for two days in a dark place for a coach to be at,” he added.
