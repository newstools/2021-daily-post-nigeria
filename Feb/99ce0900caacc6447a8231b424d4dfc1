A 35-year-old man in Adamawa State, Ibrahim Wakil, has been docked for allegedly defiling a seven-year-old girl. The man, a resident of Babal, a community in Malabu Ward of Fufore Local Government Area, confessed before the Chief Magistrates Court, Yola Town, in Yola South LGA, that he lured the little girl and forcefully defiled her in an uncompleted building in the neighbourhood. The accused has two wives and 10 children, making the court wonder why he would do anything abusive to his little neighbour. He insisted, upon interrogation, that he did not do it for any ritual purpose, but blamed the devil for his action. The prosecution said the father of the minor he defiled reported to the police on 10th February 2021 that the accused deceived his daughter and took her into the building and forced himself on her. Standing before Magistrate Uwani Danladi of the Yola Magistrate Court over the alleged offence, Ibrahim Wakili confessed that he indeed defiled the girl. Following his admission of guilt, the court ordered that he be remanded in prison custody and adjourned the case to March 22, 2021.
