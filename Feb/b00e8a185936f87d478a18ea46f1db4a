Jose Mourinho has vowed not to change his style of coaching despite poor results with his most recent clubs. The Portuguese waved aside suggestions that he needs to change his coaching philosophy after his current club, Tottenham’s latest loss at the weekend. The former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United manager insisted that his methods are “second to nobody in the world”. Spurs were defeated 2-1 by West Ham on Saturday being their fifth loss in six Premier League games leaving them nine points behind fourth place. Asked if he would consider changing his philosophy, the former FC Porto boss said, “Not at all, zero. “Sometimes results are a consequence of multiple suggestions. Mine, and my coaching staff’s methods, are second to nobody in the world. “I don’t know what you mean by crisis. If crisis is frustration and sadness in the dressing room, I would say so, because nobody is happy. “So I wouldn’t say crisis, I would say a really bad run of results. That is obvious; we are losing too many matches.”
