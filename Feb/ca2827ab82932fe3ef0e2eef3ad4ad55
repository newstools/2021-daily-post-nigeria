Akande, On Wednesday, condemned the ongoing APC membership registration and revalidation exercise, described it as wasteful at a time the nation’s economy was on the downturn. Oki, while speaking on a live radio program, Frank Talk, on Rafe FM on Thursday, proclaimed that Akande has questions to answer on the repository of the first membership registration of the party. He opined that Akande should have met with the president or any other stakeholder rather than discuss the issue in the pages of newspaper. He described the party original membership registration of the APC as a “sham”. “What Akande said is nothing but gibberish. Baba should have met with the president or any other stakeholders rather than discuss the issue in the page of Newspaper. Speaking on the reason the party need to conduct the exercise, Oki stated that registration and revalidation will revealed the actual numbers of people in the party, saying some have left that party while some have died since the last registration. “The party’s last registration was a sham. At the end of his affairs, there was a registration, a foundational membership registration, who is the repository of those memberships? Is it the national secretariat of the party or some consultants? “It is unfortunate that Baba will come out because he want to be the mouthpiece or the voice of his principal. He should keep his calm. “At 84, he is not shameful, he can’t say the truth, it is shameful for an 84-year-old man to come out and castigate a system, which he started,” Oki said.
