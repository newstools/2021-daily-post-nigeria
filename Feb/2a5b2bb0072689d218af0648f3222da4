Football agent, Jonathan Barnett, has said that one of his clients, Eduardo Camavinga will be “the best midfielder in the world”, soon. For this reason, the agent added that his client will only leave his current club Rennes for top club European clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona and two others. Furthermore, the agent told Goal that the youngster will likely cost any suitor more than €50 million (£43.5m/$60m). Camavinga, who is widely rated as one of the best young players in world football at the moment, has been linked with Real Madrid, Barcelona and other top clubs in Europe. Camavinga, Angola-born France International has enjoyed another superb season with the Ligue 1 side but is widely expected to be the subject of a move this summer. “At the moment, he’s a Rennes player,” Barnett told Goal. “Being the best midfielder in the world, that’s how I see his future, [with] a lot of medals and a lot of trophies.” “[Madrid are] a great club, a great club to play for,” he added. “They will be one of the four of five clubs in the world he might go to. “Madrid are one of those top clubs in the world, so are Barcelona.” Asked if Camavinga would cost more than €50m, he added: “I would think so.”
