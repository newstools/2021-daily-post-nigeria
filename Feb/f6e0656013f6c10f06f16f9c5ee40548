The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has disclosed what should happen to state governors negotiating with bandits. HURIWA said state governors negotiating with bandits should be arrested, prosecuted and impeached. The group was reacting to remark by the Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle that engaging bandits in a dialogue was not as bad as Nigerians make it look. Matawalle had said it was not a sign of weakness but part of peace efforts because he realised not all bandits were criminals. Reacting, HURIWA said governors negotiating with bandits have failed in securing their states, hence should be dealt with. HURIWA’s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko made the call in a statement he signed and issued. The statement reads partly: “The Zamfara State governor and all others who actively preach appeasement for terrorists and kidnappers as well as bandits, must be punished in accordance with the law which is why we are advocating for his immediate impeachment, arrest and prosecution for failing to protect his people from the violence of TERROR GANGSTERS roaming freely in that part of the Country.” Meanwhile, bandits had abduction over 300 female students of Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe area of Zamfara State.
