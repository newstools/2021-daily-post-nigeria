Erling Haaland’s agent, Mino Raiola, has claimed there are four Premier League clubs who could compete for the Borussia Dortmund striker’s signature. The 20-year-old has scored 17 goals in Bundesliga and eight times in just five Champions League appearances. Manchester United tried to sign Haaland before he joined Dortmund, while Chelsea and Manchester City have emerged as transfer rivals. Raiola expects more Premier League clubs to try and sign his client. He said: “It’s obvious that only maybe a maximum of 10 clubs have the economic power to buy [Haaland] from Dortmund so we can all fill in those clubs. “And four of those clubs are in England. And you can fill them in, you can call them and ask “Would you be interested?” Haaland has a £68million release clause in his contract, but it only becomes active in the summer of 2022.
