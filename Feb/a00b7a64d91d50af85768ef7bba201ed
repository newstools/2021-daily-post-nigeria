The draw for FA Cup quarter-finals will be conducted this Thursday evening. It will be rounded just ahead of the last fifth-round tie of the week between Barnsley and Chelsea, which the Blues are expected to win. The balls will come out from 19:45 GMT in the BT Sport studios. Manchester United needed extra time to eliminate West Ham, while Everton edged a nine-goal thriller against Tottenham on Wednesday night. Bournemouth were the first side to book their spot, while the holders Arsenal are out. The same is the case with the Premier League champions, Liverpool. Manchester City, who defeated Swansea City yesterday, are the favourites to win the competition. The quarter-final ties will be played on the weekend of March 20.
