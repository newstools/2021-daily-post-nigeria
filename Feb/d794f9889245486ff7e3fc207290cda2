Abba Moro, Senator representing Benue South Senatorial District, has announced the release of Elijah Odeh, a young barber held in Kano State over hairstyle alleged to be offensive to Islam. Moro, in a statement on Wednesday, thanked Governor Samuel Ortom and all those who, in one way or the other, lent their voices in the struggle to get Odeh released. The statement read, “I’m pleased to announce the release of Elijah Odeh, a young barber from Obi LGA arrested and detained in Kano State over hairstyle he designed on two of his customers. The case was struck out today. “Like I said the other day, I won’t allow any of my Constituents, anywhere in the country, suffer unjustly as long as I remain their Senator. “Elijah was unjustly arrested and even denied bail but thank God he’s now free. “Many thanks to Governor Samuel Ortom and all those who, in one way or the other, lent their voices in the struggle to get the young man released. It’s a victory for all of us!” Recall that Odeh was apprehended over claims that the haircut was anti-Islam and insulting to Prophet Mohammed. Odeh hails from Adum East, in Obi Local Government Area of Benue State. The barber was tried in Gyadi-Gyadi Magistrate Court sitting in Kano State.
