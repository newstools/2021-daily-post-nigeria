Haruna Kigbu, a former House of Representatives member, has defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Kigbu represented the Lafia/Obi federal constituency. NAN reports that the former lawmaker decamped with thousands of his supporters at a ceremony in Lafia on Saturday. John Mamman, Zamfara APC Caretaker Chairman, described the development as “homecoming”. Mamman recalled how Kigbu began his political career and won an election under the platform of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), an APC founding party. He assured that the politician and his loyalists would be accorded equal rights and privileges. Kigbu thanked APC leaders and members for accepting him and promised to work for the success of the party. Yakubu Dogara, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, said Kigbu was an asset who contributed to Nigeria’s development as a lawmaker. Dogara advised the APC leadership to ensure inclusiveness in the conduct of all affairs. Governor Abdullahi Sule said he was delighted that Kigbu joined the ruling party.
