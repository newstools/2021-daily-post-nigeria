Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel has agreed with Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, over his comments about the Blues job. Mourinho had claimed that coaching in the Premier League with Chelsea is not comparable to working at Paris Saint-Germain. Tuchel spent two-and-a-half years at PSG during which he won two Ligue 1 titles, twice claimed two Trophee des Champions, and the Coupe de France and Coupe de la Ligue. The German also guided PSG to last season’s Champions League final, where they were defeated by champions Bayern Munich. The 47-year-old was sacked last month, with Mauricio Pochettino replacing him at PSG. However, less than a month after his departure from PSG, Tuchel was named Chelsea’s new head coach following the sack of Frank Lampard. Speaking on the development ahead of Tottenham’s clash with Chelsea on Thursday night, Tuchel, however, insisted that neither job is better than the other. “I absolutely agree [with Mourinho’s comments],” Tuchel told a pre-match press conference. “It is totally different. It’s a totally different culture. It’s a different attitude. It’s a different way to play. It’s different, and it’s a pleasure every day.” Tuchel added: “I want to make this very clear: for me, there is no better and no worse. For me, it’s just very, very different. “If I pointed out what is different in every detail, we would be in trouble because it may seem like I’m complaining. I’m not complaining. “It was a big challenge for me to adapt to a foreign league, to a capital club in Paris, to a new language, to the club culture [different] from Dortmund. Now again, this is a challenge for me, and this is absolutely what I wanted to experience. “So Jose’s right, it is a big difference. It’s not a matter of what is better or what is worse it’s just if it fits and right now this fits perfectly for me. I feel absolutely comfortable.”
