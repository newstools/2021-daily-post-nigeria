Hundreds of Lagos party goers were sent out as they revelled on Saturday. Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, and scores of operatives stormed FM Mogame Event Center at Joel Ogunnaike Street, Ikeja. CSP Muyiwa Adejobi, Public Relations Officer of the Lagos Police Command, said Odumosu shut down the location. The spokesman said the facility and organizers flouted the COVID-19 law. He explained that the permission the government granted was for 100 guests outdoor, not indoor. Adeboji said the Ikeja party had more than 300 guests in the hall contrary to the Lagos State Safety Commission’s approval. “The place has been sealed up while the organisers have been arrested,” Adejobi confirmed.
