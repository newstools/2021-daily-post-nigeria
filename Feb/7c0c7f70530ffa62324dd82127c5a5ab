Abia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, has called on relevant security agencies in the state to help in enforcing the Anti-Open Grazing Law of the state. The governor made the call on Monday in Umuahia, the state capital, while flagging-off the statewide sensitization workshop against criminal activities in Abia communities. He noted that when the law is enforced in the state, the level of insecurity currently ravaging the state and other parts of the country, would be minimised. The Abia Governor, who was represented by his Deputy, Rt. Hon. Ude Oko Chukwu, asked stakeholders in the state to cooperate with the government in fighting against insecurity across the state. Governor Ikpeazu also charged various opinion leaders in the state especially the Traditional Rulers to live up to expectations, stating that the security of the State is everyoneâ€™s business. He lauded some stakeholders who were able to make it to the workshop, stressing that the state government would continue to ensure that her citizens were secured and disclosed that he has been assisting security agencies in the state with vehicles and necessary equipment/gadgets and would sustain the gesture.
