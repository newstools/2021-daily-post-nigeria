Chelsea winger, Hakim Ziyech has revealed why he is struggling at Stamford Bridge this season. Ziyech has scored just two goals in 18 appearances for Chelsea so far this season. The 27-year-old joined Chelsea last summer transfer window from Ajax but has yet to recapture his previous stunning form at the Dutch giants. The Morocco international is now saying that an untimely injury and homesickness exacerbated his “difficult” start at Chelsea. “I am now six or seven months here and I have started to adapt to things more and more,” Ziyech told Chelsea’s official website ahead of Tottenham Hotspur’s clash on Thursday night. “At the beginning everything is new, and it is nice but I really also love to be around my family and my mother and my brothers and friends, but at this time it is not possible. “So after a while, it was a little bit difficult, but you start to get used to it. “I have not met the fans properly yet. The fans had a game when they could come to watch and then I got injured after 25 minutes against Leeds! “Hopefully, better times will come, and everybody will be able to come to the stadium.” Ziyech added: “Of course, the last six months did not go exactly how I wanted to think it would, but it is what it is and you still need to keep improving. “I had that bad luck with my injury when I came in, but still there is time. I know for sure I believe in myself that I can do it and I can reach the same level as I used to have at Ajax here at Chelsea.”
