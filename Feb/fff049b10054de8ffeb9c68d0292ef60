Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, on Wednesday, declared that starting from 2022 year, the government would declare Hijrah holiday in line with the yearnings of the Muslim community. Makinde made the declaration during the celebration of 2021 Mawlud Nabiyy, held at the Remembrance Arcade of the Government House, Agodi, Ibadan. He stressed the need for the Muslim faithful and non-Muslims as well to continue to peacefully coexist. A statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, indicated that the governor said the state will always rise above the antics of perpetrators of evil trying to plunge the state into chaos. Makinde stressed that only peaceful and harmonious coexistence would lead the state and the country to greater heights. He implored Muslim faithful in Oyo to emulate the peaceful way of life of the Prophet Muhammad by following his legacies, charging all residents of the state to live as one. “Some are saying the governor does not want us to be celebrating Mawlud Nabbiy. That is not true. Last year, I believe we missed it. And when S.A. Islamic Affairs came to meet me that it will be nice to hold the programme this year, even despite the COVID-19 pandemic, I gave him the go-ahead. “We agreed on the date to choose, which would be convenient for our Imams, Alfas and others and that was why we chose today. I even told him that it is better we are late on it than not holding the event at all. But now, we know what is right and the promise is, from this point forward, we will be celebrating the event.” Makinde said his Special Adviser on Economy and the Director-General of Oyo State Investment and Public, Private Partnership Agency (OYSIPPA) briefed him on the need for the holiday but the matter could not be concluded. The governor added that since the Aare Musulumi raised the matter again and from his consultation, which confirmed it was the wish of the people, he would declare the holiday from next year.
