Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, rtd, the immediate past Chief of Army Staff, has narrated how he was ambushed by Boko Haram on three occasions as COAS and had to escape being killed. The former COAS said this while lamenting that all the army did to contain the terrorists under his command was not appreciated by Nigerians. Buratai said this on Saturday in Kuta, Osun State, at an interdenominational prayer organised for him by Olowu of Kuta, Oba Adekunle Oyelude. The former army boss was represented at the occasion by Major Daniel Banjo (retd) and Wing Commander Mamman Yusuf (retd.), two of his course mates. He spoke through Banjo. “At the war front, many things happened and Nigerians are not appreciative. Three times I was ambushed and jumped into the bush with my men and engaged the insurgents. My relationship with Olowu of Kuta is divine,” Buratai said. Recall that ex-service chiefs, Gen Abayomi G. Olonisakin (Rtd ), Lt Gen Tukur Y. Buratai (Rtd), Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ibas (Rtd), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar (Rtd), and Air Vice Marshal Mohammed S. Usman (Rtd), resigned their positions as the country’s security heads last week. However, President Muhammadu Buhari immediately nominated the them as non-career ambassadors. They were during the week confirmed as non-career ambassadors by the Senate
