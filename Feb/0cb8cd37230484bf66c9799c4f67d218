The Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, has said that alleged houses and properties of Fulani herdsmen being destroyed in the South East as portrayed in some viral videos circulating online were not perpetrated by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, but the communities. The Governor, who is the Chairman of the South East Governors Forum, said this on Monday during the inauguration of the All Progressives Congress (APC) registration exercise in Abakaliki, the state capital. Umahi warned that such fake videos, showing the killing of cows and burning down of houses are dangerous and worthy of instigating crises in the country. “What our people must know is that security is not political, what is demanded of the leaders is to put up programs that favour the people and foster national unity. “There is a new dimension that is taking place in the southeast which is very dangerous. It is when the communities use the name of IPOB, the video and upload it to the social media and say it is IPOB that is burning the houses of herdsmen. “It is not IPOB, it is the communities that are doing this and this is very dangerous for the Igbo man. I am talking to us as leaders,” he added. Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, at the weekend shared the news of the security outfit’s invasion of the camp of the herdsmen in Isiukwuato, Abia State. In a video shared by the IPOB leader, the ESN operatives were seen burning houses and cows allegedly belonging to the Fulani herdsmen. “Video of men at work last night across all the towns and villages of the old Bende Division, especially Isiukwuato,” Kanu captioned the video shared on his Facebook page. But the Governor said that communities are sharing such videos to instigate crises, insisting that there were no killings or destruction of Fulani properties by the IPOB.
