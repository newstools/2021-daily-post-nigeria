Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has urged the new Police Commissioner (CP) posted to the State to shun politics and stay within his professional mandate to fight crime without fear or favour. Governor Wike gave the charge when the new Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka paid him a courtesy visit at Government House, Port Harcourt. The governor said he is not unmindful that some persons may have recommended him to be posted to Rivers State, but he admonished the CP to let his conscience guide him. Governor Wike observed that the level of kidnapping in the State has increased because the immediate past CP Joseph Mukan abandoned his duty and was hobnobbing with non-state recognised chiefs. According to Wike, “The level of kidnapping has gone high in the society. Your former colleague abandoned the job and was being deceived by some people who feign that they are traditional rulers. “It’s most unfortunate that the former CP will be going to traditional rulers to be hosting him. It’s a shame. Now, Nigerians don’t have confidence anymore in security agents. “I will never come to you to say, Mr. CP, go and do what is illegal. I will never come to you to say so and so person is my friend, he was arrested for kidnapping, so release him. In fact, I’ll even say take him away. “Because if I support the person who is kidnapping, it may be my turn tomorrow, I won’t always be governor. “So, whatever you can do with your team, please I beg you in the name of God, provide security. Don’t come here and play politics. Speaking earlier, the new Commissioner of Police to Rivers State, Friday Eboka told the governor that he needs effective synergy with all stakeholders, especially the Rivers state government to succeed on his mission of crime fighting. “My duty, essentially in this state, is to fight crime and criminality. I know I cannot do that work alone without synergy with other stakeholders,” he said.
