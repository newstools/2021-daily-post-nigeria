Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, has said comparing ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo with President Muhammadu Buhari is like comparing the living with the dead. Fani-Kayode made the remark while condemning a statement by the presidency that Buhari elevated a state Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, who Obasanjo called an idiot. Buhari’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina had said the president recently received CAN chairman, Plateau State Chapter, Rev Yakubu Pam who Obasanjo described as “a total idiot”. Reacting, Fani-Kayode condemned the statement by the Presidency. In a series of tweets, the former minister insisted that bandits never abducted any CAN Chairman and demanded ransom during Obasanjo’s tenure. He wrote: “Buhari elevated the CAN Chairman Obasanjo described as a total idiot – Femi Adesina “No CAN Chairman was kidnapped and killed by terrorists under Obasanjo. No CAN Chairman was ever abducted for ransom by bandits under Obasanjo. “Comparing OBJ to Buhari is like comparing the living to the dead. “Its like comparing light and darkness. Its like comparing angels and demons. Its like comparing good and evil. Its like comparing blessings and curses. Its like comparing joy and pain. “Its like comparing Churchill and Hitler. Its like comparing George Washington and Idi Amin. “Its like comparing the sun and the moon. Its like comparing heaven and hell.”
