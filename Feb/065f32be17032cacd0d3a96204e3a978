Dr. Garus Gololo, a Chieftain of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), has called for the arrest and prosecution of the Minority Leader of the Nigerian Senate, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, without delay. This is coming on the heels of a statement credited to the leader of the opposition in the Senate, when he appeared on a Channels Television program on Monday morning. Abaribe had reportedly faulted President Muhammad Buhari, for not declaring Fulani herdsmen a terrorist group. Reacting to the development, Gololo, while addressing newsmen in Abuja on Monday evening slammed Abaribe, calling him a hypocrite. He explained that the lawmaker had no moral justification to suggest that “the largest tribe” in Nigeria be proscribed. Gololo said, “It is very unfortunate that the same Senator who stood as surety to abate the release of a man who was being prosecuted for crimes against the state, and the man later jumped bail to a foreign land; could still have the mouth to speak against Fulani people. “What crime could be more terrible than that of a man who sought to disintegrate the Federal Republic of Nigeria, with the intention of having his own sovereign state and be printing his own currency at will? Treason is a serious crime all over the world. Yet, Abaribe stood for him. “Senator Ali Ndume who stood as surety for someone who was just accused of embezzlement was arrested and imprisoned, until the accused showed up. I wonder why they still allow Abaribe to be moving freely and still be attending plenary, to the extent of having the guts to speak in a manner to disintegrate this country. “The Inspector-General of Police should work with the Federal High Court and have him arrested, so he could produce the culprit he assisted to run away. The Senate President should not even allow him to attend plenary, because his conduct is not that of a leader.”
