The Federal Capital Territory Administration has vowed to confront the menace of scavengers, cultism and drug abuse which have aided insecurity in the nation’s capital. The FCTA said the decision was part of its strategies to ensure the security of lives and property of residents of Abuja. The FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello made this known on Tuesday while speaking at the regular FCT Security Committee meeting held on Tuesday. According to the minister, drug abuse is why there are many criminal activities in the territory, stressing that such would no longer be tolerated. The Minister said, “each time there is a crisis, you find out that people of no known address, people without any means of livelihood suddenly come up with arms and start fighting each other and killing each other. All these are done under the influence of drugs and this is something that we are going to confront head-on”. He noted that scavengers known for vandalizing government property are now threats to lives, adding that such activities remain banned in the FCT. Malam Bello appealed to residents to assist security agencies in providing useful information, noting that the task of providing adequate security cannot be left to the police alone. According to him: “We need citizens’ support, especially in terms of intelligence dissemination and also for leaders at all levels, whether it’s at the ward level or at the city level to play their part and we need to communicate and also encourage citizens to be law-abiding and also to provide needed intelligence. Doing that, I think by the grace of God, we will surmount and continue to make FCT a very safe place for everybody”.
