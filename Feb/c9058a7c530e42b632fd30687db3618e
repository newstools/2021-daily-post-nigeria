Former Nigerian senior national team captain, Austin ‘Jay-Jay’ Okocha has told Egyptian forward, Mohamed Salah, to leave Premier League champions, Liverpool and join LaLiga giants Barcelona. Salah, a former Chelsea and Juventus star, has been recently linked with a move away from Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool side that won the Premier League title last season, with two years left in his contract. There were speculations linking the player with a move to Real Madrid and Barcelona after he described the Spanish giants, ‘top clubs’. Liverpool is currently going through a rough patch, and are out of the race to defend their title, a situation that has heightened the rumours of Salah leaving Anfield. Okocha believes Salah has ran out of energy in Merseyside and should join Barcelona if the opportunity arises. “If there is a chance to join Barcelona, ​​I advise Salah to go there. His energy has run out with Liverpool,” Okocha told ONTime Sports. “The situation is now regressing in Liverpool, and Salah must leave the Premier League. “If there is any chance to join Barcelona, ​​I advise him to go there,” he stressed. The Egyptian is currently the highest goal scorer in the Premier League with 17 goals, and 24 in 34 games for the Reds across all competitions this season.
