Former Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State has assured his loyalists that all of them will be captured in the ongoing membership registration and revalidation of the All Progressives Congress (APC). DAILY POST reported that some loyalists of the former Governor had alleged that they were being prevented from taking part in the exercise by some APC registration officers at different polling units. In Imeko-Afon Local Government, a video went viral, wherein an APC official, Ismaila Aregbe, was seen refusing to register those he tagged APM members. Reacting, Amosun said he had received many calls from people across the state, complaining that the exercise is taking place in the closets of some individuals instead of the polling units. “Let’s be calm. This exercise is not ending today or tomorrow. It is an exercise that will last for two weeks. Rest assured, everybody will be registered. “I have received many calls from our members across the state. They said they were not allowed to register. Some said the exercise is being done in some people’s houses. I want to assure you that everybody will be registered and revalidated. Nobody will be left out,” Amosun assured. Earlier, the Ogun State Chairman of the APC membership registration committee, Ademorin Kuye, had warned registration officers against acts that could jeopardise the purpose of the exercise. Kuye, who was with Amosun at his Ita Gbangba polling unit in Oke Aleji, Itoko area of Abeokuta South for the former Governor’s registration, said he had received up to two videos as people complained of being denied registration. According to him, a strong warning has been sent to Ward Supervisors, adding that a meeting had been slated for Saturday to address the issue.
