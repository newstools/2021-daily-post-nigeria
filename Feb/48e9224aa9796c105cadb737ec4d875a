Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministries International reportedly said he procured his third private jet during the COVID-19 pandemic which kept the entire world on a stand still in 2020. The apostle made the comment during a sermon as captured in a video making the rounds on social media. According to him, the COVID-19 lockdown periods were time for him to rest, stating that he prayed for the pandemic to continue. He said, “In COVID (pandemic) I bought a jet; the third one. I have three. I was praying for COVID-19 not to end because I was resting. While people were complaining, my wife asked, ‘Can life be this sweet?’ Am I talking to somebody here?” “No stress. I read on the Internet that there’s a rumour going around that I have a machine that prints money. I like that rumour. They say, ‘he should be investigated. He has a machine that prints money. “Somebody asked if it’s true and I said it is true. They said, ‘It’s risky o’. I said I didn’t know it’s risky because I already bought the machine. When you speak in tongues, you’re printing money.”
