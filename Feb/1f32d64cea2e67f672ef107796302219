Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has debunked rumours that he could leave the club and insists he does not need a break. Last weekend, Klopp admitted the Reds would not be able to defend their Premier League title, following a 3-1 defeat against Leicester City. Liverpool have now lost three consecutive league games and sit 13 points behind leaders Manchester City, who have a game in hand. There were reports that Klopp could leave Anfield, but ahead of their Champions League clash against RB Leipzig, he remained defiant about his future. “Did I get the sack or did I leave by myself? Neither,” he said. “I don’t need a break. Privately, we had a tough time, that was a much longer time already and we always deal with it as a family 100%. “I am 53. I have worked in football for a long time and I can switch off. I don’t carry things around. Nobody has to worry about me. “I am full of energy, honestly. I see it as an interesting challenge. We will sort it by playing football, we will sort it by fighting with all we have. That’s the plan.” After the Champions League tie, Liverpool take on Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield on Saturday.
