The Kano State Government has ordered the closure of ten boarding schools in the state over frequent abduction of school children in the Northern part of the country. The order for the closure of boarding schools in the state is coming following the abduction of over 300 female boarders by bandits in Zamfara State. The state Commissioner for Education, Muhammad Sunusi Kiru, disclosed this in a short audio message he sent to DAILY POST. The Education Commissioner said the closure became necessary due to the rising number of abductions of school children in neighboring states. The closed schools are situated at Ajingi, Sumaila, Jogana, Kafinmaiyaki, Gaya, among others. Muhammad Kiru noted that the order takes effect immediately. He called on parents to evacuate their wards from affected schools without delay.
