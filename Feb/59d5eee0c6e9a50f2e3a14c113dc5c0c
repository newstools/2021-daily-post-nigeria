Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has again advocated arm license for himself and other Nigerians in order to face the security challenges facing the country, especially the incessant herdsmen/farmers crisis. The governor made this known on Wednesday while addressing newsmen in Makurdi the State capital. The governor who accused President Muhammadu Buhari of nepotism, said the Federal Government deliberately refused to caution the armed Fulani men against killing innocent Nigerians. He said he had once asked the Federal Government to grant him arm license, adding that “when an armed Fulani man is aware I have a gun, he would be scared of coming close”. He urged the president to live up to his promise of “I belong to everybody and I belong to nobody”, adding that with the current security situation in the country, Buhari is for only the Fulani men. Governor Ortom said: “This country belongs to all of us and the presidency must act fast because time is going. “Why is the Federal Government quiet about this Fulani matter? When will the Federal Government come out to criticize and arrest these Fulani men carrying AK-47? Are we second class citizens in this country?” I stand with my suggestion on gun licence to citizens - Benue gov, Ortom Insecurity: Ortom denies asking Nigerians to own guns Emmanuel Onwubiko: Presidency of a tribe above public good
