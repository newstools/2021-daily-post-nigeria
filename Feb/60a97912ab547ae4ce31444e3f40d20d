Veteran Nigerian journalist, Uche Ezechukwu has passed away. An author and columnist, he was a former member of The Sun Editorial Board. He also worked with The Authority. Ezechukwu died just over three weeks after a cryptic post on Facebook. He talked about death after the passing of Sam Nda-Isaiah and Tony Momoh. “The trumpet is sounding so loudly and so frequently. And our comrades are heeding the call. In that Gana Street office alone. Sam Nda, Tony Momoh, etc. “When will it be my turn? Only God knows. None can evade or avoid its call. Oh God, keep us ready at all times,” he wrote on February 2. Mourners have been commiserating with the family while making reference to his comment. Popularly called Onukwube, the deceased hailed from Amesi in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State.
