Tottenham Hotspur boss, Jose Mourinho, has named Harry Kane, as one of the world’s best strikers. Mourinho said this after Kane scored a goal in Tottenham’s 2-0 victory over West Brom on Sunday. Kane’s goal against West Brom means the England international has now drawn level with the club’s legend, Bobby Smith’s 208 goals for Spurs. Only Jimmy Greaves has more goals than Kane, who scored the opener against West Brom. “He [Kane] is a special player in the history of the club and will beat every possible record,” Mourinho said at post-match. “He is one of the best strikers in the world. There is nothing else you say. “The team depends a lot on him. I can’t hide that. It is the goal he can score, it is the assist he can make, he is the link player that he is. “He has that personality that the top players have and he is always a very important influence for us.”
