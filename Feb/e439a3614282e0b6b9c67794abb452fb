Hours after attacking the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, popular Yoruba freedom fighter, Sunday Adeyemo, has begged the leading Yoruba monarch for forgiveness. DAILY POST reported earlier that Adeyemo, who is popularly known as Sunday Igboho, had during a virtual meeting, accused the Ooni of betraying the Yoruba race, saying he visited President Muhammadu Buhari to collect dollars. Sunday Igboho, who has threatened to free the Yoruba race from killer Fulani herdsmen, came under heavy criticism on Wednesday for calling Oba Ogunwusi unprintable names. In a video on Wednesday evening, Sunday Igboho said he had spoken with the monarch on phone and had begged him for forgiveness. “I have called our father, the Ooni of Ife and I have apologised to him. When I said those things, I was carried away by my emotions. The killing of my people by Fulani herdsmen and the way our fathers in Yoruba land are handling the issue is giving me great concern. “I am a Yoruba man and I know it is not in our culture to insult the elders. I have called the Kabiyesi and I have apologised to him. You can call him to confirm. “Once again, I want to beg our royal father to forgive me. It was a slip of tongue,” Sunday Igboho said.
