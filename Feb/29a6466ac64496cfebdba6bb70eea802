The Biafra Nations League, BNL, has warned that the continued militarization of Orlu, Imo State and other parts of the South East by the Federal Government will likely result in uprising in other areas of Biafra. The group warned that the President Muhammadu Buhari government will be getting a “terrible signal” from it in a matter of time. The BNL stated this in a brief statement to DAILY POST on Tuesday signed by its National Leader, Princewill Chimezie Richard where it also disclosed its decision to move their operational base to Bakassi Peninsula. Richard said that the group is prepared to face any trouble that may arise from it’s activities, adding that the government has been taking them for granted because it(FG) is yet to receive a signal from them. “Our operational base is and remains Bakassi Peninsula, although we have been peaceful and watching the way our supporters are being killed,” he added. “This government does not understand the word peace, I think because they are looking down on us “They will get a terrible signal from BNL soon”.
