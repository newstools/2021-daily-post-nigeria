Niger Governor, Abubakar Sani-Bello, on Wednesday, signed into law, the bill against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and the bill for Premarital Medical Examination. The bills were sponsored by Binta Mamman and Malam Shuaibu Liman, representatives of Gurara and Suleja constituencies in the House of Assembly. Bello said the GBV law gives relevant agencies the legal backing to tackle the menace of violence, mostly suffered by women. The Governor, according to NAN, added that the premarital examination law mandates couples intending to get married to go for tests. “This is to ensure that necessary medical examinations such as genotype, HIV/AIDS and fertility tests are conducted on couples before marriage to avoid crisis after,” he said. Bello commended the legislature for initiating the bills and ensuring the passage.
