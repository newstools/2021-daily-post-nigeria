Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, on Saturday, sacked his Special Adviser on Media, Salihu Tanko Yakasai. Yakasai was sacked over his continued comments and utterances which are deemed contrary to the stand of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, which he is serving. Recall that Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, father to Salihu Tanko Yakasai had claimed that his son was arrested for calling for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday. Following the news of the abduction of the students of the Government Girls’ Secondary School in Jangebe in Talata Mafara Local Government Area of Zamfara State on Thursday, Salihu had questioned the APC government’s effort to protect its citizens, thereby calling for the resignation of the President. In a statement issued by the Kano State Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, on Saturday, he said Yakasai’s sack was with immediate effect. He said the aide had failed to differentiate between personal opinion and official stand on matters of public concern and therefore cannot be allowed to continue to serve in a government he does not believe in. Ganduje further warned political appointees and public servants to guard against making statements capable of drawing superfluous controversy.
