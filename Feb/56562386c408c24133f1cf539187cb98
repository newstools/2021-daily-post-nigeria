The All Progressives Congress (APC) Chairman in Anambra State, Fief Ejidike, says Igbos can produce President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor in 2023. He said this was possible if the people of South-East moved into the APC en masse. Ejidike spoke on Thursday when a former Police DIG, Celestine Okoye, joined the party at his polling unit in Awka. “APC has done so much for the South-East and Anambra in areas of infrastructure, the South-East has never had it like this”, NAN quoted him as saying. “The only way we can get more is to join the mainstream and 2023 will be a sure bet for South-East to produce the next president.” Ejidike assured that the party would provide equal opportunity to every member in the state. On Wednesday, Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi said majority of Igbos were ready to become APC members. Umahi added that President Buhari had performed well in the region.
