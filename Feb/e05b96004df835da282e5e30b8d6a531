Odion Ighalo has touched down in Saudi Arabia, where he is undergoing his medicals ahead of a move to Al-Shabab. The 31-year-old has agreed on a two-and-a-half-year deal with his new club. The transfer window in Saudi does not close until February 7, Sky Sport reports. Ighalo returned to Shanghai Shenhua after his loan deal with Manchester United came to an end. The former Super Eagles striker joined the Reds in January 2020, initially until the end of May. With the 2019/2020 campaign continuing into the summer, United reached an agreement to extend his loan until this month. Overall, Ighalo made 23 appearances for United, scoring five goals.
