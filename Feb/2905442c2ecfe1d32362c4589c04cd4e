Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has taken a dig at his players over their naive mistakes during their 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa on Saturday. The Spaniard warned his squad that they cannot keep making mistakes if they want to be a top-four team. The Gunners went behind after only 74 seconds at Villa Park, as Bertrand Traore pounced on a stray pass from Cedric Soares and passed for Ollie Watkins to score what proved to be the winner. Arsenal dominated possessions but could only muster three shots on target compared to eight for Villa. Arteta felt his side deserves to win the match but were undone again by mistakes at the back. “Those teams don’t make those mistakes. Those teams cannot play in the first 22 games of the season four or five times with 10 men. It doesn’t happen. “There is not a team in the world that can sustain that. “And still if you make an error, you concede early, the team has to react. And the team reacted and we had more than enough to still come back and win the game. “So if you don’t do one, you have to do the other one. Because if you don’t do neither of them when you have the chances and you are not ruthless enough in the opponents’ box, then of course you are going to lose the game,” Arteta said after the game.
