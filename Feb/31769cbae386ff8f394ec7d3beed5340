Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has revealed he tried to sign Luis Suarez while he was coaching Paris Saint-Germain. Suarez left Barcelona for Atletico Madrid last summer, but PSG were one of the clubs interested in signing the 33-year-old. However, the former Liverpool striker decided to remain and has quickly become a key part of Diego Simeone’s side. “It was a possibility. We heard the rumours he was about to leave Barcelona, and who cannot be interested in signing one of the best strikers in world football history and the present?” Tuchel said ahead of Chelsea’s clash with Atletico in Bucharest. “We tried our luck, we did not make it. He decided to stay in Spain, move to Atletico, and has proven his quality. “He is a natural striker, a born striker, and has the certain mentality that only strikers have.” Suarez has 16 goals in 24 appearances for Atletico Madrid this season.
