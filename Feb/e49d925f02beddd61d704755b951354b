Minority Whip of the Ogun State House of Assembly, Hon. Jemili Akingbade, has announced his defection from the African Democratic Congress (ADC) to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). DAILY POST reports that the lawmaker, who represents Imeko-Afon State Constituency, has registered as a member of the APC at his polling unit. Addressing his loyalists at Owode Afon, Akingbade said, “APC is the party, and we have made the right decision after due consultations with critical stakeholders.” The legislator, who decamped alongside his teeming followers, assured APC chieftains in Imeko Afon Local Government of his unalloyed support for the party, the administration of Governor Dapo Abiodun as well as the ‘West2West aspiration of Sen. Solomon Adeola’. In their separate remarks, the APC Caretaker Chairman in Imeko Afon, Hon. Yaya Fadipe; the LG Transition Chairman, Hon. Albert Asipa and Otunba Bisi Oloyede, welcomed Akingbade to the party, adding that “the local government is now one family under the umbrella of the APC.” DAILY POST reports that with Akingbade’s defection, the Ogun Assembly now has 23 APC lawmakers, two ADC members and one other from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
