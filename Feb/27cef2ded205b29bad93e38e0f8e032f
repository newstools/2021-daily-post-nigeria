The presidency has said that the court will determine the legality or otherwise of President Muhammadu Buhari’s extension of the tenure of Mohammed Adamu as Inspector General of Police. Last week, Buhari directed Adamu to continue in office for three months. Legal practitioners have kicked against the action, insisting that the President does not have such powers. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN) stated that Buhari violated the constitution. The lawyer declared that Nigeria presently has no IGP recognized by law. Adegboruwa said the constitution provides that before appointing or removing an IGP, the President must consult the Nigeria Police Council. But speaking to Channels TV on Tuesday, presidential aide, Femi Adesina told Nigerians to allow the law to take its course. “It is within the prerogative of the President to appoint who the IGP would be, and he has done that. “Whether he is retired or not, it’s a legal matter. I know some lawyers are in court, the court will pronounce on it”, he said.
