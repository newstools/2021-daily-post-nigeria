Alhaji Oba Ajara, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Kwara State, has said that the party was responsible for the woeful defeat it recorded in the 2019 elections in the State. Recall that the All Progressives Congress, APC, swept the polls in all the 2019 elections, recording a landslide victory in the National Assembly, State Assembly and the governorship elections in the State. In an interview with newsmen in Ilorin, Ajara, a former aide of late premier of Northern Nigeria, Sir Ahmadu Bello, said, “We have learnt our lessons and we shall bounce back in the 2023 elections in the State.” He said what happened in the 2019 elections to the PDP was a self inflicted defeat contrary to the impression that the APC was stronger than the PDP. “We are keeping our strategic plans to our chest, as we leave the masses to analyse the difference between the previous government and the present one.” “The defeat of the PDP was caused by aggrieved members within the party”, he said, adding that, “we will bounce back before the 2023 general elections.” The PDP chieftain commended former governor Bukola Saraki for making a difference while in power with the execution of infrastructural development and human empowerment programmes which he said was missing in the present administration in the state. Ajara described the proposed N35b bond by the state government as a scam that will not serve public interest but go down the drain. On insecurity confronting the country, he said “I am worried that I can’t sleep with my two eyes closed because nobody knows what could happen the next moment.” Ajara called for investigation by the security agencies to get to the root of merchants involved in the insecurity question confronting the country. He challenged the Federal Government to do more in the protection of lives and properties, describing the ongoing killings and bloodletting as uncalled for and frightening.
