The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has remained coy over his chances of becoming Nigeria’s next president. Amaechi, speaking on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics, said only God knows the country’s next leader. The former Governor of Rivers state also insisted he is focusing on his job as a minister under President Muhammadu Buhari and would not like to be distracted. “I am still the Minister for Transportation and only God can tell who will be the President of Nigeria in 2023,” he said. Amaechi had earlier said the Kano-Maradi (Niger Republic) rail project will cost the federal government $1.9bn. “The project is going to cost us $1.9bn and we will source it from mostly Europe. We are about concluding it,” Amaechi said. When asked how long it will take Nigeria to repay the loan, he claimed it is not within the jurisdiction of his ministry.
