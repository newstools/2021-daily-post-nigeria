The leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has once again knocked the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari. According to Ayodele, the President and those working with him have broken the unity of the country. The prophet frowned at the method the government has chosen to negotiate with bandits and other criminal elements with a view to ending terrorism. Ayodele during a live service in his church on Sunday said Nigeria was already broken. He explained that terrorism will continue to grow bigger and tougher in Nigeria because the government has invited terrorist already by negotiating with bandits. He explained that the unity of Nigeria has been broken and that it is only God that can bring the country back. “Giving amnesty to Boko Haram and negotiating with bandits is tantamount to breaking Nigeria. “President Buhari and his people have broken Nigeria, in no time, it will come to realization but as it is now, the unity of Nigeria has been broken, only God can bring us together.”
