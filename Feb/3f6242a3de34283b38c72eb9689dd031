An Ondo State High Court, Akure, has convicted Opadule Caroline Abimbola, an officer of the Nigerian Correctional Service in Ondo, for fraudulent receipt of property. Abimbola was arraigned by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) in 2020. She had pleaded “not guilty” to alleged fraudulent receipt of property, making a false statement to a public officer, and using her office to confer corrupt advantage on herself. The offences are contrary to Sections 13, 25 and 19 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000. The ICPC prosecuting team told the court how at various times in 2012, Abimbola of the then Nigerian Prison Service, Ondo, was overpaid to the tune of N1.2million above her normal monthly salary. The convict did not report the overpayment and made a false statement to the ICPC when she was interrogated. Justice Olabode Adegbengbe of High Court 5, Akure, sentenced her to a fine of N100,000 in lieu of custodial sentence. He also ordered Abimbola to refund N900,000 to ICPC Recovery Account within three months and enter into a bond to be of good behavior.
