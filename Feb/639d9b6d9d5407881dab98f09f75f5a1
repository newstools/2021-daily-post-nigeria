A bandit leader, Auwalu Daudawa, and six members of his gang, on Monday, surrendered 20 AK-47 rifles and one RPG to security agencies in Zamfara State. They declared their repentance from banditry at a meeting with Governor Bello Matawalle and security agencies in Gusau. Daudawa appealed for the forgiveness of the government and the people of the state. Matawalle commended him and followers for dropping their arms. He also lauded the council of Ulamas and residents of the state for supporting the process. The governor vowed to sustain the dialogue to ensure lasting peace in Zamfara. “We thank Daudawa and his members for their repentance and implore them to join hands with the state government in convincing others to also repent. “We have more than 20 AK-47 released by the former bandits, this is very commendable. I call on the people to pray for Daudawa and his team so that he can maintain his oath”, Matawalle said.
