The All Progressives Congress (APC) has announced the death of one of its long-standing staff, Abdulrasak Usman Sanusi. Abdulrasak, fondly called ‘Baba Osun’, died during an illness. The deceased was the Dispatch Supervisor at the National Secretariat in Abuja. Abdulrasak, born December 26th, 1959, was married with children. He hailed from Osun State. He previously worked at the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), one of the APC legacy political parties. Abdulrasak attended St. Bartholomew boarding school and Kufena College (both in Wusasa-Zaria); Center for Islamic & Arabic Studies, Ikirun; Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi, and Advanced College of Economics, Zuba-Abuja, where he bagged an Ordinary National Diploma in Economics. He served in different capacities at the Bola Ige Northern Youth Members, Northern Coalition for Democracy & Justice, Northern Youth Alliance, Integrity Social Friends, Pro-Aregbesola Support Group and Afenifere Renewal Group. John Akpan Udoedehe, APC National Secretary, said the party would miss his experience and dedication to duty. The scribe conveyed condolences to the family and staff of the national secretariat. Udoedehe prayed Allah to God to forgive Abdulrasak’s shortcomings and grant him rest.
