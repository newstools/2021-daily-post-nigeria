The Senate on Wednesday charged President Muhammadu Buhari to declare a state of emergency on insecurity in Nigeria. This was in response to the abduction of students and staff of Government Science Secondary School, Kagara, Niger State. However, the lawmakers adopted the resolution following a motion by the Niger East Senator, Mohammed Sani Musa. Speaking, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan lamented the persistent kidnapping of students in the country. Lawan said the frequent abduction of students would reverse the gains made in school enrolment over the years in the North. He said parents would no longer yield to persuasion to enrol their wards in school with the level of insecurity plaguing the area especially the kidnap of school children. Suspected bandits had abducted students and staff of Government Science College in Kagara, Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State. Reacting, Buhari had ordered dispatched security operatives to Minna, Niger State over the abduction of students in the state. The president had directed the dispatched armed forces and men of the Nigeria Police Force to rescue the students and staff members abducted.
