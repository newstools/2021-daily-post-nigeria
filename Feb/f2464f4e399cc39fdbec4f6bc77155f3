Bayern Munich striker, Robert Lewandowski, is now the third top scorer of all time in the Champions League. The Pole pounced on a poor back pass to open scoring in their 4-1 win over Lazio on Tuesday in a last-16 first leg. In doing so, he surpassed former Real Madrid striker Raul Gonzalez in the competition scoring charts. Lewandowski is now only behind Cristiano Ronaldo (134) and Lionel Messi (119). Bayern’s 17-year-old midfielder Jamal Musiala doubled their advantage, making him the youngest English player to score in the competition. Leroy Sane and a Francesco Acerbi own goal stretched the Bundesliga champions’ advantage early in the second half, before Joaquin Correa pulled one back. It was an 18th consecutive match without defeat for Bayern Munich in the Champions League.
