Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara state, on Monday, condemned the alleged violent attacks on some chieftains of the All Progressives Congress in Edu Local Government Area of the state. He warned that the “state government will not hesitate to bring the full weight of the law on anyone who inflicts violence on another person.” Governor Abdulrazaq charged security agencies to go all out against anyone involved in violence of any kind. A statement by his spokesman, Rafiu Ajakaye in Ilorin, said “The governor also described as unfortunate and politics taken too far, the claim that his aids currently on different assignments in Ilorin, the state capital, are the ones physically behind the unfortunate incidents in Gbubgu area of Edu Local Government. ” Anyone found to have perpetrated the violence should be arrested and prosecuted,” he stated, adding that ” the administration has zero tolerance for violence.” He sympatised with victims who had their properties damaged or sustained any form of injury, declaring that ” This is totally unacceptable.” Governor Abdulrazaq, warned against fake news because of its consequences for societal peace and harmony. ” Those who are bent on tarnishing the image of the governor, went on to town to say that the chairman of the Teaching Service Commission, Alhaji Bello Abubakar Taoheed and Senior Assistant to the governor on job creation, Barrister Aliyu Al-Hassan, physically led the hoodlums who attacked some chieftains of the party. ” This is a wicked lie, because the two officers are in their various offices in Ilorin. How can somebody in Ilorin lead attacks in Gbugbu , a town hundreds of kilometres away from Ilorin?” he queried. Governor Abdulrazaq urged every stakeholder to eschew violence as the registration and revalidation exercise of party members begins on Tuesday as the government will deal with any perpetrator of violence.
