Three goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and a strike from Hector Bellerin gave Arsenal all three points against Leeds. “Happy, really happy – my kids are going to be happy because they will get it [the match ball],” Aubameyang said at a post-match press conference after the game. “I’m happy with the performance. I knew it would be a hard game – they never gave up, but we managed the game well. “The hat-trick means a lot to me. I’m a guy who always works hard. It’s been a tough time for me. “Everyone was giving a lot of love to me, my mum and my family. I’ve to say thank you to everyone at the club and the fans.” Meanwhile, speaking on Aubameyang’s performance against Leeds, Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta said: “We have been missing his goals and him at his best. “He has been training after a difficult period with a family issue and we had a feeling he could be key in this game.”
