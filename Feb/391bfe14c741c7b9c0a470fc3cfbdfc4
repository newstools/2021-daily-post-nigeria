DAILY POST reported on Sunday that Ajogun was redeployed alongside nine others, in a police wireless message dated 12/02/2021, with reference number, TH.5361/FS/FHQ/ABJ/SUB.4/576. However, another police signal has been released by the Force headquarters in Abuja on Wednesday, asking Ajogun to remain in his former duty post, being Ogun Police Command. “INGENPOL has cancelled the posting of Compol Edward Owolowo Ajogun to CP Coordinator of Courses PSCJ. The officer is by this directive to remain in his former duty post please,” the police wireless message reads. No reason was given for the cancellation of the CP’s redeployment to Jos.
