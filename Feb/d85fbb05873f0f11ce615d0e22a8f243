Referees in the English Premier League are paying for their mistakes, missing out on annual performance-related bonuses of up to £50,000 with each error, SportsMail reports. Referees are awarded marks for every fixture they officiate, depending on whether their decisions are deemed right or wrong. These scores are tallied by their bosses in a ‘merit table’. A typical Premier League referee earns a basic salary of around £110,000 to £120,000, but bonuses can take it up to £160,000 or £170,000. Bonuses are determined by the ‘merit table’ produced by referees’ body PGMOL at the end of each season. The top-ranked referee will receive the highest bonus and the bottom-ranked official gets the lowest. It is believed that a typical mark for a referee might be 8.4 out of 10. If he makes a major mistake, it drops to 7.9.
