Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has said that his team was defeated 1-0 against Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday evening because the Gunners lacked the quality to score goals. Arsenal had seven shots against Man City in the game, but only one of those was on target as Raheem Sterling’s first-half goal gave Pep Guardiola’s men all three points against the host at Emirates. The result against Man City means Arsenal are now in the 10th position on the Premier League table with 25 points from 34 games. Speaking after the game, Arteta told Sky Sports, “When we conceded the first goal, it put us in a difficult situation. “It was tough. With the formation and the players they use, they are really comfortable. “After that, the team reacted really well, was on top of the game and created chances, but we lacked the quality in those situations to score the goal.” Arteta added: “We got something wrong. We didn’t do it in the first 10 minutes. It’s a cross, and Raheem Sterling cannot head a ball there. “You cannot concede that goal. It was a tactical thing that we were prepared for, but we didn’t read it in the game.”
