President Muhammadu Buhari, on Monday, bade his former Aide-De-Camp (ADC), Col. Mohammed Abubakar, farewell. Lt. Col. Yusuf Dodo is the new ADC. Dodo was an Academy Adjutant of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA). The Nigerian leader picked him from a list of three possible successors Abubakar submitted. The Colonel, 48, will commence a five-month course in Santiago, Chile, from March 8 to July 30. The course is a prerequisite for his promotion to the rank of Brigadier-General, expected in the last quarter of 2021. Abubakar is the longest serving ADC to a civilian president. He has been with President Buhari since May 29, 2015. He is also the second longest serving ADC in the history of the Nigerian armed forces after late Col. Walbe, who served Gen. Yakubu Gowon for nine years. Abubakar has been described as an experienced commander, instructor, security manager and a talented investigator. Born on March 28, 1973 at Wusasa in Zaria, his father is from Kano State and his mother is from Edo State. Abubakar attended the Nigerian Military School, Zaria from 1985 to 1990. He is a fellow of the Nigerian Army Resource Centre.
