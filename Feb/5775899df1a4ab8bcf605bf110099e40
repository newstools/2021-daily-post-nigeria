Former England striker, Michael Owen, has predicted some of the Premier League matches that will be played this Sunday. Manchester City are away to 10th-placed Arsenal at the Emirates. Pep Guardiola’s men have the chance to secure their 13th consecutive win against the Gunners. Owen feels they will beat the Gunners 3-1. “The Citizens are steam-rolling all before them at the minute, and with a win in the cup already under their belts at the Emirates this season, I think they’ll have too much for the home side once again,” he said. On Manchester United’s clash against Newcastle at Old Trafford, Owen added: “This is a big test for Newcastle and it is one I think that’s just out of their grasp at the minute. “It’s 2-0 Manchester United for me.”
