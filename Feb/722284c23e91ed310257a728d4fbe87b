There was drama on Saturday at the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on End SARS. The panel members were divided over the return of Lekki toll plaza to its owners, the Lekki Concession Company (LCC). The Chairman, Justice Doris Okuwobi, delivered the ruling after another application by Demola Seriki, counsel to the LC. Beside her were DIG Taiwo Lakanu (Police), Lucas Koyejo (National Human Rights Commission), Segun Awosanya (Segalink) and Oluwatoyin Odusanya (Citizens Right). As Okuwobi read the ruling, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN) walked in with Patience Udoh (Civil society), Rinuola Oduola and Temitope Majekodunmi (Youths reps). After the Justice’s remarks, Adegboruwa announced their opposition. “We have a dissenting opinion. That’s why you saw that we came in late”, he said. As the SAN continued his comment, Okuwobi interjected with: “The panel will rise. The panel will rise.” But Adegboruwa and others remained seated. He told the court that to recall that youths were represented initially. The LCC defence team immediately challenged the lawyer to recuse himself, noting that he once took the company to court over toll collection.
