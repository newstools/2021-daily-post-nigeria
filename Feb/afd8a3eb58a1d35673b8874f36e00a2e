The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has called for the immediate sack of the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi, for asking unarmed Nigerians to defend themselves against continuous attacks by armed bandits. Recall that the Defence Minister had advised citizens to defend themselves against Bandits. The retired General also told Nigerians to stay at alert at all times. He said people should not be cowards, adding that bandits sometimes possess few rounds of ammunition. Reacting, PDP in a statement released by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbodiyan, described the statement by the minister as reckless, irresponsible and a confirmation that the Buhari administration has surrendered to outlaws and has no determination to fight them. ‘It is insensitive and totally unacceptable that a government would describe unarmed victims who suffer bandits attacks as “cowards” while those who were elected and possess the right resources to defend them recede in the comfort and safety of their offices in Abuja. “Such disposition to security; a responsibility of government, reveals that our nation is indeed descending to a failed state under the Buhari Presidency. “Given the silence by the Buhari Presidency, our party holds that the insensitive comment by the minister explains why the Buhari-led administration has remained ignorant in the fight against banditry in the country. “Such a statement by the Buhari administration, at the time it ought to be sorting out ways to guarantee the safety of all Nigerians, have emboldened bandits, and kidnappers to continue their acts of committing atrocities. “This also shows that this administration is comfortable with creating lucrative job for bandits, and kidnappers who are at the end settled with huge ransom instead of being made to face hash judgments,” the statement read.
