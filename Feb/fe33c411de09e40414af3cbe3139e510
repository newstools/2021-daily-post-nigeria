Nobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to order the Army to back Nigerians in flushing out killer herdsmen. Soyinka made the remark while urging Buhari to publicly renounce the activities of killer herdsmen across the country. The Nobel Laureate made the call in an interview with BBC Pidgin. Speaking on what he is expecting from Buhari, Soyinka said: “Address the nation in a very stern, unambiguous terms. “Say openly, yes, I know I am the matron of the cattle rearers association, etc. “I am a cattle rancher myself, it is a business and I run my business on business terms. “I do not run my business by killing people. I do not run my business by raping, displacing, torturing and I don’t run my business by occupying land that does not belong to me. “Whatever comes to you for illegal occupation or for trespassing in other people’s property is your business. “And I am ordering the Army, I am ordering all the security forces to back citizens’ efforts in flushing you people out. “I expect nothing less even at this stage. “This is the language I expect from President Buhari and as long as that language does not come, I must consider him quite complacent with what is going on because the buck stops at his desk.” Nigeria has been experiencing crisis between herdsmen and farmers across the country. This crisis had led to loss of lives, property destroyed and cattle killed. Only recently, the Eastern Security Network, ESN, had chased Fulani herdsmen out of Isiukwuato area of Abia State.
