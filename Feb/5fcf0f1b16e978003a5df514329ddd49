Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has criticized his players including captain, Lionel Messi, after they failed to beat Cadiz in the La Liga on Sunday. Koeman saw Barcelona drew 1-1 at Camp Nou following a first-half penalty from Lionel Messi and a late second-half penalty from Alex Fernandez. The Dutchman said that Barcelona players were not up to the task in the attack, adding that they should have defended differently against the visitors. According to him, the result was a great disappointment and a missed opportunity for Barcelona after Atletico Madrid lost 2-0 against Levante on Saturday. “It’s disappointing,” Ronald Koeman said at a post-match press conference after the game. “These kinds of games have to be won, and we did not. It’s a missed opportunity after Atletico Madrid’s defeat, and it is a great disappointment. “We shouldn’t have let the two points have escaped. We’re disappointed, but I don’t like to blame individual players. “We weren’t up to the task in the attack, and we should have defended differently.” Barcelona is now in the third position on the La Liga table with 47 points from 23 games.
