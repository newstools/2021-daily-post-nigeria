Former Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Abdullahi Dikko, is dead. The Katsina State indigene died after battling an unknown illness. Last year, a Federal High Court in Abuja lampooned the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) over Dikko’s trial. The ICPC was prosecuting Dikko and two others for alleged N1.1billion corrupt practice. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu declared that the ICPC was not serious in handling of the matter. Aside Dikko, other defendants are Garba Makarfi, ex-Assistant Comptroller-General of Customs (Finance, Administration and Technical Services) and Umar Hussaini, a lawyer and owner of Capital Law. The trio, were among others, accused of asking the Managing Director of Cambial Limited, Yemi Obadeyi, to pay N1.1billion into the account of Capital Law Office. The money is alleged to be a refundable “completion security deposit” for the purchase of 120 units of duplexes as residential accommodation for officers of the NCS.
