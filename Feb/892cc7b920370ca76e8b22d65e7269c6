The National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, has reacted to reports that one of its resident officers died of COVID-19 at Kano Orientation camp. There were reports online that the officer posted to the orientation camp developed COVID-19 symptoms and died on Tuesday. But, NYSC’s Director-General, Shuiabu Ibrahim denied that the resident officer died at the Permanent Orientation Camp at Kano. Ibrahim said the officers tested positive for COVID-19 but died at Kano isolation center and not in the orientation camp. The NYSC DG said this in a programme on Channels TV, reiterating that all prospective corps members for the three-week course underwent the COVID-19 test. “First and foremost, it is not true that the resident officer died in the camp. “The staff concerned just like other prospective corps members and camp officials underwent COVID-19 test. “His result came out positive and he was taken away by the NCDC staff to the Kano State Isolation Centre. So, that’s where he (deceased officer) passed on,” Ibrahim said.
