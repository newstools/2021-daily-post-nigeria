Former Chelsea midfielder, Michael Ballack, has revealed why striker, Timo Werner, is struggling at Chelsea. Werner, one of Frank Lampard’s marquee signings, has struggled to adapt to Chelsea’s style of play since his move to Stamford Bridge from RB Leipzig last year. The Germany international has not scored in 14 Premier League games for Chelsea. But Ballack is now saying that Werner is struggling at Chelsea because he was used to playing differently at Leipzig. According to him, the 24-year-old had a lot more space in front of him during his time at the German club, while Chelsea is the kind of team that has a lot of ball possession. “Timo started off pretty well,” Ballack told Omnisport. “Of course, if you are not scoring as a striker, then it is hard on your self-confidence. “I believe that it’s very hard for him. Overall, as he was used to playing differently at Leipzig, he had a lot more space in front of him. “Chelsea is the kind of team that has a lot of ball possession, wanting to dominate the opponent. Maybe even more so with [Thomas] Tuchel. “Maybe he has to work on his playing style a little bit or try to get himself into better positions. “As a striker, you are depending on your fellow players to find you, and if the [goal drought] breaks, then he will be able to find his old form. “He used to have good phases with the national team, using his physical presence and power to break down on the wing. “So when the [drought] breaks, then things will go better again.”
