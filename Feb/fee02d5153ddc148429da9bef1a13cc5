Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has warned his players not to allow complacency set in, ahead of this weekend’s clash with Manchester United. Tuchel was speaking after the Blues’ 1-0 win over Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday. The win puts the Stamford Bridge side in good stead to qualify for the quarter-final. Chelsea will now return to Premier League action against United, hoping to extend their eight-game unbeaten run under Tuchel. But Tuchel has said they “cannot get comfortable or get lazy” ahead of a crucial four-game stretch in their top four ambitions. Tuchel said: “Honestly, we now play Manchester United, Liverpool, Everton and Leeds but this is good. We cannot get comfortable or get lazy.”
