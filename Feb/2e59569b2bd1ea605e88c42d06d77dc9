The O’odua Peoples Congress (OPC) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate the killings in Oyo State. Clashes between Yoruba and Hausa in Shasha community in Akinyele Local Government Area of Ibadan claimed lives after the death of a man on Friday. In a statement on Sunday, OPC Publicity Secretary, Yinka Oguntimehin, regretted that a minor disagreement degenerated into a tribal crisis. “It is unfortunate that a misunderstanding between two traders eventually led to killing and destruction. “President Muhammadu Buhari should investigate the circumstances surrounding the ugly incident, so as to bring the culprits to book and forestall further crisis”, he said. Oguntimehin also decried the shooting of an Amotekun operative by the Divisional Police Officer, Ile-Igbon Division in Surulere Local Government Area of Ogbomoso in Oyo State. The DPO, Adepoju Ayodeji, reportedly shot the security outfit member for arresting Fulani herdsmen who allegedly destroyed a cassava farm. Oguntimehin demanded the immediate probe and prosecution of the officer. OPC condemned the activities of kidnappers, bandits and criminal herders in Southwest and advised traditional, political, religious leaders and security agencies to collaborate to ensure peace and citizens’ safety.
