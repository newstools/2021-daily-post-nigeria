Amaq news agency has released footage of the attack on troops in Askira by Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP). In the video dated February 12, 2021, scores of fighters stormed the area with rifles, gun trucks, and a FV103 armoured personnel carrier. Many of them moved on foot as they approached a military base. Nigerian ground and air forces fought back; their counteroffensive left a number of insurgents dead. Troops of 28 Task Force Brigade and other units engaged the ISWAP members as Nigerian Air Force aircraft shelled gun trucks. An intelligence officer confirmed the operation was successful. He said aircraft were scrambled from Yola and Maiduguri within minutes after ground troops sent the signal. Senator Ali Ndume (APC – Borno) hailed the military after the battle. The lawmaker said it was “professionally executed as there was no loss of lives or property of the indigenes except the killings of the insurgents that attacked the town”. Amaq released a video showing ISWAP fighters inside of Askira. An FV103 can be seen and it appears to be facing little resistance. Apart from that, dozens of fighters and several vehicles storm the town. This is obviously before NAF did its job. pic.twitter.com/051FldFOY2 — Tomasz Rolbiecki (@TomaszRolbiecki) February 12, 2021
