Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment, has dismissed claims that President Muhammadu Buhari has marginalized people of the Southeast. Ngige said Igbos have held sensitive positions like the Inspector General of Police, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Finance and Economic Planning Minister, among others. He said despite holding sensitive positions in government, Igbo people have failed to use their position to develop the Southwest. Speaking in Anambra State on Monday, the Minister charged people of the Southeast to stop blaming the president for their failures in the Southeast. He said: “I am not saying that giving sensitive positions to Igbo under Buhari regime is not good. “I am saying that Igbo people have held sensitive positions such as the Inspector General of Police, Secretary to the Federal Government, Finance and Economic Planning Minister, etc, but did not use the positions for the welfare of Igbo nation. “Igbo people in the Diaspora are angry with Nigeria because of the kind of comments emanating from the South East over Buhari’s appointments. “It is not true there is no Igboman among the service chiefs. The Chief of Defence Staff, Lucky Onyenucheya is an Igbo. Chibuike Amaechi is an Igbo. It is not even proper to tell our brothers from the South-South that they are not Igbo people. “They fought on the side of the Igbo during the civil war, and they suffered casualties. Today, we are telling them they are not Igbo. It is not good.”
