A middle-aged woman, Habiba Muhammad, on Thursday told a Shari’a Court sitting in Rigasa, Kaduna State that her former husband, Umar Adamu refused to leave her house after divorce two years ago. She begged the court to order Adamu out of her house. Habiba who claimed that the property belongs to her late father accused the ex-husband of verbal assault. “I inherited the house from my late father. He has refused to move out of my house. He curses and calls me names in the presence of my children,” he said. However, in his defence, the defendant said Habiba was still his wife. ”We have 10 children together. Our first child is the owner of the house we are living in. She is lying,” she said. In his judgement, Malam Salisu Abubakar-Tureta ordered the complainant to bring her house documents on Feb 22 to validate her claim.
