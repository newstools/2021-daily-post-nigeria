Governor Bello Matawalle has vowed to continue dialoguing with bandits just as the council of traditional rulers in the state described the Jangebe incidence as an irony considering the tremendous successes of the peace accord. The Council of 17 Emirs who paid a sympathy visit to the Governor on Sunday morning over the abduction of the Jangebe female students praised the commitment of Governor Matawalle as well as his success in the last one and half years in curbing the menace of banditry in the state. The Emir of Anka, Alhaji Attahiru Muhammad Ahmad, who is the Chairman, state council of chiefs said ‘We note that just as you are doing your best, others elsewhere are doing their worst. We also know that you do not control the security architecture. If you did have their total control, we know such a thing will never happen in the state” the Emir noted. “As true representatives of our subjects, we are here to register out sympathy with you and to promise you that we are solidly behind you in your bid to secure our communities’ the Emirs added. The Council, therefore, called on the Governor to relieve his mind of heavy worry over what happened and prayed that God will return the girls back home safely. ‘We urge you to continue with your good work which we note is the best approach that is yielding results in our communities’. In his response, Governor Matawalle assured the Council that despite the setbacks, he will continue with the peace process as it is still the best option for peace in the process of finding lasting peace in the state. “Any sabotage to the efforts we are making in the state is sabotage to the efforts of the Federal Government. The world knows our boundaries and the world knows our successes’, Matawalle observed. He commended the Emirs for their concern and promised that his administration will do everything within its powers to rescue the innocent girls and return them to the warm embrace of their respective families.
