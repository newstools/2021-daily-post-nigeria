Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, has said he does not agree with those who claim Nigeria has “a new Buhari from Sudan” in Aso Rock. Obasanjo stated this while answering questions in a virtual interview with historian, Toyin Falola, on Sunday. He expressed his worry over the spate of insecurity in the North West of the country, where President Muhammadu Buhari is from. Obasanjo then urged the President to wake up and fight banditry and other crimes especially in the northern part of the country. He said, “I thought I knew President Buhari because he worked with me. But I used to ask people, is it that I have not read him well or read him adequately or is it that he has changed from the Buhari that I used to know? I am not subscribing to the people who say we have a new Buhari from Sudan and all that nonsense. “I know what I believed was his limitations and I have written about it – he wasn’t strong in economics, not all of us are strong in anything but you need to have sufficient knowledge of it for you to direct the affairs. He wasn’t particularly too strong in foreign affairs but I thought he was strong enough in the military. “But with what I have seen now, I believe that maybe he will be thinking of a legacy. Maybe he will also learn from what has happened in recent times. If you are the commander-in-chief and banditry is taking place in your backyard, then you have to wake up.”
