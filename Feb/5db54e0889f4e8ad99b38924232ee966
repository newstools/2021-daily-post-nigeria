Armed bandits terrorizing some Local Government Areas and communities in Niger State have expressed their anger with locals. They listed their grievances during a mediation chat with Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Abubakar Gumi. The parley followed the Tuesday night abduction of staff, students and relatives at the Government Science School in Kagara. Notorious bandits leaders including Dogon Gida, Kachalla, were in attendance. “The meeting took place at an isolated area inside a forest in the Niger State,” a security source informed PRNigeria. “They are not happy that several of their cows have been stolen by robbers. They alleged that their fellow herdsmen have been killed by some villagers. “They also let Sheikh Gumi know that vigilante members in some communities attack Fulanis and their family members, whenever they sight them going to markets and towns.” The bandits took Gumi round locations where bodies of their Fulani relatives and family members, killed in aerial bombardments, were dumped. The bandit leaders, however, told Gumi that they were ready to end killings and abductions. They expressed willingness to be part of any deradicalization exercise or programme that the government will unveil for “our boys”.
