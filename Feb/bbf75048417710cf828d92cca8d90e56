A day after a mobile policeman was shot dead in the city of Warri, Delta State, the Commissioner of Police, CP Ari Muhammed Ali has reacted angrily to the killing of policemen in the State. CP Ali said the State Command will no longer tolerate the senseless and devilish attacks on policemen who are doing their legitimate jobs. He warned killers of policemen to desist from such acts or be ready to ‘dance the music’ in accordance with the laws of the land. Speaking on the killing of the Mobile Policeman who was shot dead at Edjeba community yesterday, Ali said efforts were on to fish out members of the syndicate behind the killing. While noting that he is committed to the safety of the officers and men of the command, CP Ali said, “From the records of killings so far, we have come to realise that those responsible for the killing of policemen and carting away their rifles are members of a syndicate, especially that of cult groups desperately in need of arms and ammunition to gain superior advantage over other rival groups in a particular area. “We are not leaving anything to chances anymore as we have intensified our own internal security strategy and network aimed at curbing the excesses of these syndicates in some strategic locations in the state. “Just recently, we initiated a ‘Permanent Pin Down Checkpoints’ in some strategic locations especially within the Warri area and its environs where this crime appears to be on the increase in recent time and we have deployed more men for this purpose.” CP Ali admonished community leaders to partner the police in its fight against crimes by providing useful information that could lead to the arrest of criminals. He stressed, that its only with this kind of useful information that the police can work effectively. Ali also charged the officers and men especially those with service rifles to be at alert every time wherever they are so as to avoid being attacked and killed by criminals.
