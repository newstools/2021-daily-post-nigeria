Foremost economist and a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Abia State, Alex Otti, has cautioned against unnecessary scheming ahead of the 2023 general elections. Otti appealed to all members of the All Progressives Congress to dedicate more efforts to what would help impact positively on the people of Abia State. He gave the warning in his speech at a meeting with the members of the Abia State Executive Committee of APC-led by the chairman and a former State lawmaker, Hon. Donatus Nwankpa, during the weekend.  Alex Otti, a former two-time Governorship Candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance(APGA), in Abia, disclosed that he invited the leadership of the party for what he termed unofficial brotherly interaction that would give them the opportunity to share ideas on how to move the party and the state forward While restating that he joined the APC wholly and left nothing in his former party, APGA, Otti further cautioned against divisiveness and insisted that thereâ€™s only one APC in Abia State led by Honourable Donatus Nwankpa as the chairman, and enjoined all to queue behind him for greater work in the party, especially at the grassroots, where he said, the party needed to do more work. He disclosed his willingness to play critical roles aimed at ensuring that the party becomes far stronger than it is presently, and advised against internal bickering, advising members to practice forgiveness as a healthy ingredient for togetherness in the party.
