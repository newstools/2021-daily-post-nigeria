Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has backed Thomas Tuchel’s decision to remove Callum Hudson-Odoi during Chelsea’s 1-1 draw with Southampton on Saturday. Hudson-Odoi started the game from the bench but replaced the injured Tammy Abraham after the first half. Tuchel, however, removed the England forward and brought on Hakim Ziyech in his place. Wenger replaced a substitute only one time during his 22-year reign at Arsenal in 2008, when Emmanuel Eboue was hauled off at home against Wigan. And the Frenchman has admitted Hudson-Odoi badly struggled and was “not in the game” at all in the second half at Southampton. He told beIN Sports, “I’ve done it once in my life really because I was scared to lose the game because the guy was completely lost. “Basically, he [Hudson-Odoi] played in a Christmas tree, in that position behind the central striker which became Werner in the second half and he [Hudson-Odoi] never found the right position in there. “I see him more in a wide position and he was not in the game.”
