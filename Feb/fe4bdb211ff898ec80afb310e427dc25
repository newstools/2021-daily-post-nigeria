Marseille have suspended manager Andre Villas-Boas, after he clashed with the Ligue 1 outfit over the signing of Olivier Ntcham from Celtic and subsequently offered his resignation. The French club completed Ntcham’s signing on Deadline Day. The 24-year-old arrives on loan until the end of the season and the agreement includes a £4.5m option to buy him. But speaking at a news conference ahead of their game away to Lens on Wednesday, Villas-Boas said: “I submitted my resignation, saying that I did not agree with the sporting policy. “I don’t want anything from OM. I don’t want money. “We ended the transfer window with a new player [Ntcham]. He is a player that I had said no for.” Marseille have now announced Villas-Boas’ suspension and will also launch disciplinary proceedings. A club statement read: “Olympique de Marseille announces the pending disciplinary proceedings of Andre Villas-Boas. “This decision has become unavoidable given the recent and repetitive actions and attitudes that have seriously harmed Olympique de Marseille and its employees, who devote themselves to it on a daily basis. “The remarks made today during a press conference in regard to Pablo Longoria, general manager in charge of football, are unacceptable. “His exceptional achievements should not be questioned and, on the contrary, were welcomed by all during this winter transfer window, which was affected by an unprecedented crisis. “Possible sanctions may be taken against André Villas-Boas following disciplinary proceedings.”
