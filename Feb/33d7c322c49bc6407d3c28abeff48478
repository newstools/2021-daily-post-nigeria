Former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu has revalidated his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Saturday. He returned to Nigeria two weeks ago. The APC national leader was in London for weeks on vacation. Tinubu has remained silent since his return, despite tension in the South-West over the quit notice to herdsmen. Some say the politician is being tactical to avoid any form of confrontation with the North due to his purported 2023 presidential ambition. Meanwhile, in reaction to recent developments, ex-Senate President Bukola Saraki, accused some prominent citizens of refusing to speak out. “The deafening silence by key stakeholders, leaders and others who we think should speak out is worrisome. This silence is a dangerous tell-tale sign that things are wrong. “This is not good for our country. We must all speak out and talk about the solution to this twin-problem of insecurity and threat to national unity”, Saraki said in a statement. Insiders believe Tinubu was among the targets of the former Kwara State Governor’s veiled reference. Meanwhile, Tinubu’s ally and pioneer APC national chairman, Bisi Akande, has condemned the ongoing membership registration and revalidation exercise. The ex-Osun State Governor called it a waste of funds, arguing that no population census is repeated less than a decade and that voters are not re-registered at every election. “I see the present APC membership registration within less than a decade after the original register as an indefensible aberration leading to certain ugly perceptions”, he said.
