The Nigerian Police have placed N10 million bounty on some individuals. On its official Twitter handle, the police force said these persons were captured on CCTV at a crime scene. “Ten Million Naira (#10,000.000.00) awaits anyone with useful information on the whereabouts of the persons in the photo,” they tweeted on Thursday evening with pictures of the suspects attached.  Recall that a prime suspect in the series of killings that took place in Akinyele local government area of Ibadan, the Oyo state capital, Sunday Shodipe was rearrested after the state police command placed a bounty on his head. DAILY POST reported that Shodipe was earlier arrested and paraded in July 2020 He, however, escaped from police custody on Tuesday, 11th August 2020 after he has been charged to court. Oyo state police command then announced a reward of five hundred thousand naira as reward for anyone with useful information that will lead to his re-arrest. And after some days, Shodipe was rearrested.
