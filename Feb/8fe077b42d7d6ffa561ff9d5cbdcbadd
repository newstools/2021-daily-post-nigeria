Paul Pogba’s brother, Mathias, has warned Manchester United that they might need to look at selling him now if they want to get a transfer fee. Mathias claims Pogba could leave Old Trafford as a free agent. Pogba has consistently been linked with a move away from the Premier League outfit and has spoken several times in the past about taking on a new challenge. His brother, Mathias, who plays for Racing Murcia in Spain, has now hinted he might now commit to United beyond his current deal in 2022. “He is happy. He is improving his game,” Mathias told El Chiringuito. “He has a year left on his contract. I don’t know [if he will stay until then]. “The only thing I can say is if United want money, they have to sell him now. That is the only thing I can say. If not, he will go for free. “I haven’t heard anything about him renewing his contract.”
