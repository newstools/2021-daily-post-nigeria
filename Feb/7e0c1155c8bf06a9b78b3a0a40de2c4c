Manchester United have been dealt a major injury blow, as Paul Pogba was taken off injured after 39 minutes of their Premier League clash with Everton. Pogba has been in fine form in recent weeks, but now looks set for a spell on the sidelines. Towards the end of the first half, the France midfielder pulled up in discomfort after playing a simple pass towards Victor Lindelof. He pointed to his right thigh as he was treated on the pitch, before being replaced by Fred. United were two goals ahead through Edinson Cavani and Bruno Fernandes at the time. Everton struck back, equalising through Abdoulaye Doucoure and James Rodriguez. Scott McTominay looked to have won the game for United with a 70th-minute header. But Everton found a dramatic late equaliser through Dominic Calvert-Lewin, with the forward scoring at the death in a 3-3 draw. After the match, Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told MUTV: “Thigh, yeah. It looks like a muscle injury, so we’ve just got to check him up tomorrow and have a scan and get him treatment. Hopefully he’ll recover quickly.”
