Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has confirmed that centre-back, Thiago Silva, will not take part in his side’s Premier League clash against Manchester United on Sunday evening at Stamford Bridge. Silva had missed Chelsea’s last five games because of a muscle thigh injury. The Brazilian international sustained the injury during Chelsea’s 1-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur earlier this month. However, speaking at his pre-match press conference on Friday, Tuchel revealed that the 36-year-old would return to his squad next week. “He [Thiago Silva] did an individual session today, on the pitch, and felt it was big progress,” said Tuchel. “It’s a big step ahead for him, so I hope he will join the group next week.” Chelsea head to the game after beating Atletico Madrid 1-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday. The kick-off time for Chelsea vs Man United is 5:30 pm.
