Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has criticized Callum Hudson-Odoi’s “body language” and “attitude”, following their 1-1 draw at Southampton on Saturday. Hudson-Odoi started the game from the bench but replaced the injured Tammy Abraham after the first half. Tuchel, however, removed the England forward and brought on Hakim Ziyech in his place. “I wasn’t happy with his energy, attitude with the counter-pressing,” the former Paris Saint-Germain coach told BT Sport about his decision on Hudson-Odoi after the game. However, Tuchel said, “it will all be forgotten tomorrow”. Mason Mount’s penalty cancelled out Takumi Minamino’s first-half goal. On the game, Tuchel added: “Yes we had all chances and all possibilities to win. “We were very good in 80 metres of the pitch but the last 20, I wasn’t happy.”
