Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has provided the latest injury update on Defender, Thiago Silva, ahead of his side’s Premier League clash with Newcastle United next week Monday. Silva picked a thigh injury during Chelsea’s 1-0 victory against Tottenham Hotspur on February 4. The Brazilian centre-back has been a key player at the heart of Chelsea’s defence but he was forced off the pitch after just 36 minutes of the London derby with an injury. Providing an update on Silva, Tuchel said the 36-year-old feels better and he is getting the right treatment. The German also said that Silva would miss Chelsea’s FA Cup fifth-round tie against Barnsley at Oakwell Stadium on Thursday night. “Thiago is out for tomorrow [Barnsley vs Chelsea match] for sure,” Tuchel said at his pre-match press conference on Wednesday. “He feels better and better though, which is good and he’s getting the right treatment. “One thing we can be sure of with Thiago though is that he will be spending every minute available to him to speed up the process of healing. “It is a muscle injury though so we cannot force it and we will wait for Thiago.”
