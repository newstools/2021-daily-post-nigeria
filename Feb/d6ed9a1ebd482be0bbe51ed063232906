Chelsea billionaire owner, Roman Abramovich, has written to the squad, saying he is “appalled” by the racist abuse directed towards Reece James. The 21-year-old was the target of racist messages on Instagram last week. Abramovich has now written to every member of the squad and promised to provide more funding in order to tackle the problem. “Racism has no place in our club nor in our society. Our club is committed to fighting racism, antisemitism and all forms of discrimination. “I want you to know that as players you have my and the club’s absolute support,” the letter read in part. It added: “I have therefore directed the board to further increase the club’s efforts in this area and I will personally direct more funds towards this important work. We will be setting out our actions as a club in the coming days. “I want Chelsea Football Club to do more to challenge discrimination at our club, in our communities and in the world around us. “Rest assured that we will play a leading role in this vital work and demonstrate that football is a sport that is open to all.”
