The All Progressives Congress, APC in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja, has said it will commence revalidation and registration of its members come February 8th. The Minister of State for the Federal Capital Territory, Dr Ramatu Aliyu made the disclosure on Friday while presenting the revalidation and registration committee in Abuja. According to the Minister, the exercise would last for a period of two weeks to enable every interested, old and intending members participate. He warned the committee not to give room for internal wrangling capable of dividing the party. ”We are gathered here today to fulfil one of the constitutional rights as stipulated by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), that is, revalidation of membership and registration of new members. ”This shows that the party is open to new members and encourages the old ones to revalidate their membership. “There are so many reasons for us as a party not to disenfranchise anyone, but to give each other a voice and a very strong voice. ”This exercise shall be free and fair, devoid of any sentiments. We will not give room for internal wranglings to divide us. “Fortunately, even as much as we do not win the Senate and House of Representatives seats; we did not lose the entire territory because we have four of the six area council chairmen and a majority of councillors still with us. ”That tells us clearly that something very interesting might happen in the next elections,” she stated.
