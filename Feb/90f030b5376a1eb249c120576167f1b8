Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has blamed goalkeeper Alisson Becker, for Liverpool’s 3-1 defeat at Leicester City on Saturday. Mohamed Salah gave the Premier League champions the lead in the 67th minute, as they looked to get back to winning ways following defeats at home to Brighton and Manchester City. But Jurgen Klopp’s side capitulated, conceding three times in the final 12 minutes. It was Leicester’s second goal to take the lead though that will stand out. A high ball from Wilfried Ndidi saw Alisson rush out of his penalty box and collided with debutant Ozan Kabak, which allowed Jamie Vardy to tap the ball into an empty net. Ferdinand said on BT Sport: “That situation there, the keeper has to take control of that situation. That’s a lack of confidence. “I would be more concerned about the fact they concede and the team capitulates, that for me is a big concern. “This team was one you talked about leaders, mental strength, resilience, robust. They are anything but that at the moment. When that goal went in they became a soft touch.”
