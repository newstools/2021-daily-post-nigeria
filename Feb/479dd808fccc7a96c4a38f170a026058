A Kano Chief Magistrates’ Court, on Tuesday, ordered the remand of an 18-year-old housewife, Suwaiba Shuaibu, in a correctional centre. She was accused of stabbing her husband’s 17-year-old fianceé to death. Shuaibu, who resides at Gimawa village in Doguwa Local Government Area of Kano, faces a count charge of culpable homicide. NAN reports that the Police arrested the defendant on January 19. The Prosecutor, Asma’u Ado, told the court that Suwaiba committed the offence on January 1, at Gimawa village, Kano. Asma’u recalled that on the same date, at about 10:00 pm, Suwaiba called the deceased, Aisha Kabir, of the same address through her phone. “The defendant deceived and lured the victim into an uncompleted building, situated at Gimawa village, attacked and stabbed her with a sharp knife on her neck and chest. “On January 2, the victim was found at the uncompleted building by her father, one Kabiru Jafaru, and was rushed to Tudun Wada General Hospital where she was confirmed dead by a medical doctor,” Asma’u said.
