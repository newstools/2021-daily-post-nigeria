Son Heung-Min has debunked rumours that manager coach Jose Mourinho is losing the respect of the Tottenham Hotspur dressing room. Mourinho is under increasing pressure after Spurs dropped to ninth position in the Premier League following four defeats in five games. Their best chance of qualifying for the Champions League next season, increasingly looks like winning the Europa League. And on Thursday, they face Austrian side Wolfsberger AC in the round-of-32 first leg. On the rumours, Son said: “The mood went a little bit down when we had a couple of bad results but I think the changing room has not changed about these kinds of things. “Everyone is happy, everyone is having a laugh. Everyone is focused in every single game so what should I say? It is a bad rumour.”
