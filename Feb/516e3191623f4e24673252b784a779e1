Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has predicted Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side to beat AC Milan when both sides clash in the Europa League last-16 first-leg tie on March 11 at Old Trafford. Scholes believes Man United have the best team in the Europa League ahead of Arsenal and Tottenham and will cruise past AC Milan. Man United eliminated Real Sociedad in the last-32, while AC Milan knocked Crvena Zvezda out from the competition. “[Manchester] United have the best squad left in the competition [Europa League],” Scholes told BT Sport. “We thought that last year, but obviously Sevilla were around then, and we know what they are like in the EL. “Man United are much better than Arsenal and Tottenham. I think United would cruise past Milan.”
