Former French Secretary of State, Georges Tron has been sentenced to five years in prison for raping and sexually assaulting a colleague. The 63-year- old who is currently the Mayor of Draveil, was found guilty by the Paris Appeal Court late on Wednesday after originally being cleared of the charges in 2018. Prosecution Counsel, Vincent Ollivier stated that the rape and sexual assault of one of the plaintiffs who is also his client in November 2009 and January 2010 were ‘established by the constant and detailed statements of the victim. Oliver also said that Tron was forced to hand his resignation to Mr. Sarkozy when the rape accusations were first made public in 2011, but he consistently claimed it was all part of a plot by political enemies. He said Tron’s co-accused, Brigitte Gruel, a former aide in Draveil, was also convicted of aiding and abetting gang rape and sexual assault and given a two-year suspended prison sentence. However, after the conviction on Wednesday the Prosecution counsel revealed that judgement passed was a message of relief for his client. “It is also a message of hope for other women who find themselves in a similar situation,” Olliver said.
