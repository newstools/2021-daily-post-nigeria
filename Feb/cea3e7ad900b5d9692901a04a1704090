Imo State governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, has refuted claims that there were plans to assassinate his predecessor, Rochas Okorocha. Uzodinma told newsmen after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja that he has no personal issues with Okorocha. Uzodinma said, “You will recall that before I became the governor, the Ihedioha administration set up a judicial panel of inquiry to look into acquisitions and allegations of lands, converting government lands to personal property and then removing private lands from individuals and giving to other individuals. “The judicial panel of inquiry chaired by a judge met and they concluded our job and a white paper have since been raised. “You know institutions and agencies that are involved with implementation are doing their job. The Imo governor maintained that he is not directly involved and the decision was taken by the government, adding that the aggrieved parties should go to court to address the issue and not take laws into their hands.
