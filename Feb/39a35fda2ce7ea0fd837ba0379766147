The FCT Administration (FCTA) on Tuesday threatened to close the famous Bannex Plaza and EFAB Shopping Mall in Abuja if they continued to flout the COVID-19 safety protocols. Mr. Ihkaro Attah, Head, Media, Enlightenment and Publicity of FCTA Ministerial Task Force on Enforcement of COVID-19 Protocols, issued the warning on Tuesday , stating that the warning became necessary due to flagrant violations of COVID-19 Health Protection Regulations 2021. Attah warned that FCTA would not allow offenders to risk the lives of residents of the territory. “We went out on routine patrol where we looked at key areas like plazas, we also looked at the malls and traffic issues. “We observed that many people are getting relaxed and we are getting them to understand that the Presidential Executive Order on COVID-19 protocols is very much in place, “From the arrest we made today, we got too many people arrested from the EFAB Plaza at area 11 and Bannex Plaza in Wuse II. These two plazas need to as a matter of extreme urgency, put their plazas in order. He urged the management of the two business facilities to get all the washing points ready and ensure that those who come into the premises comply by wearing their face masks. ” We are going to close Bannex Plaza as well as the EFAB Mall if they fail to comply in the shortest time,” Attah warned.
