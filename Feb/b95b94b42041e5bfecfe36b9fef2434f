Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has condemned the ban issued to Financial institutions against having any crypto or facilitating payments for crypto exchanges by the CBN. The activist Omokri in a post on his Twitter account on Friday criticised the Buhari- led Government for constantly trying to frustrate innocent citizens. Omokori also wondered how the CBN could be so daft as to shut down a money market like the cryptocurrency which brings in millions into the economy. He, however, warned Buhari that making Nigerians poorer can never stop the next protest that may erupt in the country again. “How can you shut down a money market like cryptocurrency, that brings in tens of millions of dollars into your economy at the time when you are in a recession and need every penny you can get? “Buhari should know that he cannot stop another End SARS protest by making Nigerians poorer,” Omokri fumed. Recall that the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN on Friday, banned all Financial Institutions from having transactions in crypto or facilitating payments for crypto exchanges.
