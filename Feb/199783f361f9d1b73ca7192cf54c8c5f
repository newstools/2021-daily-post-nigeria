Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has said that he “feels sorry” for Tottenham Hotspur boss, Jose Mourinho, after Everton defeated Spurs 5-4 in the FA Cup fifth-round tie on Wednesday night. Ferdinand also criticised Mourinho’s men for “consistently” making individual mistakes. Bernard’s first half extra-time goal ensured Carlo Ancelotti’s side eliminated Tottenham from the competition after the match ended 4-4 after 90 minutes at Goodison Park. “I have to say I actually feel sorry for him [Mourinho] in some ways,” Ferdinand told BT Sport. “Because in recent weeks he’s changed quite a few times in the way they have approached games. The West Brom game was a bit different when Harry Kane was not playing, and now tonight was open and expansive. “But each and every one of those times recently they have been undone by individual moments, individual errors. ‘As a manager, you can prepare all you like all week for each game, but these individual errors are killing him. “In that sense, I feel sorry for him because sometimes it just derails his whole plan that he’s worked on all week. “I think it’s a quality thing [issue], yeah. I think there are too many players consistently making mistakes and it’s leaving them open, and they have to chase games some of the time. “Until they get that right and eradicate those types of mistakes they can never really consider themselves a team that is going to challenge consistently because mistakes lead to goals, which then means you chase and leave you open, it is a problem consistently.” Mourinho still has the chance to win silverware with Tottenham this season as they will play Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final. Tottenham are also in the Europa League knockout phase. They will face Austrian side Wolfsberg next week.
