Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State and Chairman Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress, APC, on Thursday, revalidated his membership status of the party. Buni revalidated his membership of the party at his polling unit in Buni Gari ward of Gujba Local Government Area of the state. Speaking shortly after the exercise, the Governor said that “the exercise will further strengthen and reposition the party for future victories.” He further explained that the registration process is being conducted successfully in line with the constitution of the party (APC). He assured that no APC member will be left out in the exercise, saying “no APC member will be left unregistered.” Recall that, on Saturday, the President of the Senate Ahmed Ibrahim Lawan had revalidated his APC membership status at his polling unit in Katuzu ward, Gashua. While briefing newsmen shortly after the exercise, the number three said APC is hoping to register at least one hundred million Nigerians into the party’s fold in the ongoing registration and revalidation exercise nationwide. He added that the exercise is further taking the ruling party to the grassroots, as Mr President recently said in Daura that, the party should be built from bottom-to-up. “People at the grassroots should have the party when it is time for them to take decisions on who they should vote for in congresses, they should take those decisions; when it is time for them to decide who should run for any political office, it should be their decision. “So, this is further democratizing the APC and I believe that this exercise is an exercise that APC should approach very positively. “We would not register nothing less than a 100 million Nigerians and we have every chance and indeed every reason to register more than a 100 million Nigerians in this exercise. And this exercise by the way of registration and revalidation does not terminate at the end of this month or first week of March”, Lawan said.
