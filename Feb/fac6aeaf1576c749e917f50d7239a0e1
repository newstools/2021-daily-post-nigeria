Former Arsenal boss, Arsene Wenger, has ruled Liverpool out of the Premier League title race. Wenger, speaking after the Reds’ 3-1 defeat at Leicester City on Saturday, branded their chances of catching Manchester City as “impossible”. The Frenchman won three titles himself while managing the Gunners and feels Liverpool cannot make up the gap after 24 games. When asked whether he feels Jurgen Klopp’s side are still in the hunt, Wenger told beIN SPORTS : “No, I don’t think so. “Man City is 10 points ahead, has one game in-hand, they look to be on a run and I don’t think with 14 games to go, you can catch 13 points against a top team. “I never seen it, 13 points. If it was eight to nine, yes, but if Man City win their game in-hand, 13 points – it’s impossible.”
