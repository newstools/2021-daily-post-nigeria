A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Makurdi on Wednesday, ordered that Jeremiah Nnamdi, a student of the Federal University of Agriculture be remanded in a correctional centre for killing a lecturer, Dr. Karl Kwaghger. Recall that Dr. Kwaghger, an Associate Professor in the Mechanical Engineering department of the same institution, was on Saturday murdered at the premises of the JS Tarka Foundation in Makurdi. DAILY POST reported that the police charged Jeremiah who was arrested in connection with the murder with criminal conspiracy, armed robbery and culpable homicide. However, Jeremiah was on Wednesday arraigned before Chief Magistrate Vincent Kor, for a hearing of the case. The prosecution counsel, Sgt Friday Kanshio told the court that Mr Victor Hemba, the Managing Director of JS Tarkaa Foundation, Makurdi reported the case at the ‘B’ Division Police Station, Makurdi on Nov. 28, 2020. Kanshio said the security supervisor discovered the corpse of the deceased, Dr Karl Kwagher, by the gate. The prosecution also said that Nnamdi was arrested in Abuja where he went to sell the car stolen from the deceased during investigations. He added that Nnamdi confessed to the crime and told police detectives that his initial intention was to threaten the victim with a make-believe gun and rob him of his Toyota Venza with registration number RSH 746 NY. According to him, Jeremiah also confessed that he committed the crime along with Osinachi Michael, who is at large. Delivering Judgement, Magistrate Kor who did not take Jeremiah’s plea for want of jurisdiction ordered that he be remanded in Correctional Service Centre, Makurdi. He adjourned the matter until April 5, 2021, for further mention.
