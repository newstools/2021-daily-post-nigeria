Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has condemned the alleged attempt by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) to arrest Yoruba freedom fighter, Sunday Igboho. Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Aviation Minister had raised the alarm that DSS operatives and policemen numbering 40 made an attempt to arrest the activist along the Ibadan/Lagos Expressway on Friday. Reacting, Nnamdi Kanu on his Twitter handle, warned that Sunday Igboho should not be touched. “I condemn in totality the pathetic attempt to arrest Sunday Igboho earlier today. “This is yet another deliberate act of provocation by the Fulani Caliphate. No #Fulani mass murderer, Miyetti Allah or bandit is under arrest. Nigeria is on the brink! Igboho should not be touched,” he warned. Meanwhile, the secret service in a statement signed by its Public Relations Officer, Peter Afunanya, distanced itself from the allegation. Afunanya stressed that the news was misinforming and should be disregarded.
