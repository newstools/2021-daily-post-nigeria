The Nigeria Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC) has denied appointing Tonto Dikeh’s as an Ambassador for Peace Building. The Nollywood actress had taken to her Instagram account on Friday to announce that she’s now a “proud Nigeria Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC) Ambassador for Peace Building.” She also urged her followers to pray for her as she embarks on peace building across the six geopolitical zones of the nation because peace is indispensable. The news, however, generated reactions from Nigerians on social media who were of the opinion that the controversial actress is not the right person for the position because of her lifestyle. Reacting, the NCPC in a statement released on Friday disowned the appointment. The statement read: “The Nigeria Christian Pilgrims Commission NCPC wishes to state that King Tonto Dikeh paid an official courtesy visit to the Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Christian Pilgrim Commission Rev Yakubu Pam on 25th February, 2021 at the corporate headquarters of the Commission in Abuja. “As the founder of Tonto Dikeh Foundation, she expressed her willingness and interest in partnering with the Commission in the area of peace building. “She equally cashed in on the visit to commend the NCPC boss for his positive and relentless peace initiatives across the country. “However, we are suddenly clouded with claims the actress that she has been officially appointed as Ambassador of peace by this great Commission. This claim has gone viral in the media. “The Commission frowns at this claim which is a clear misrepresentation of what transpired and wishes to state that it is a false information. “The fact remains that the Executive Secretary of NCPC never appointed Tonto Dikeh an Ambassador of Peace for NCPC. “Nevertheless, we appreciate her desire to partner with us in our peace building initiatives and in the area of pilgrimage sponsorship to the Holy Land.”
