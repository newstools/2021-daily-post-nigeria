Chelsea became the last team to qualify for this year’s FA Cup quarter-final, thanks to a narrow 1-0 win against Barnsley on Thursday. Tammy Abraham tapped in Reece James’ cross in the second half, to see off the battling Championship side. Thomas Tuchel made as much as 10 changes to his team from the Sheffield United win and they struggled to find their rhythm. Barnsley took advantage of that and created the better early chances. However, Tuchel changed his side’s shape after the break, bringing on James to replace Marcos Alonso and centre half Antonio Rudiger for Andreas Christensen, switching to four in defence. The win was the fourth in five games for Chelsea since Tuchel assumed duty Chelsea will now face Sheffield United for a place in the semi-final.
