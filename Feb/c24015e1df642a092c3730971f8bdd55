Nigeria’s Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, has hinted that the country might soon exit the second wave of COVID-19. Ehanire stated this on Monday, while speaking during a briefing by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19. According to him, the country has been recording a decline in the number of COVID-19 cases. He also observed a decreased positivity rate from sustained testing in states, which according to him is synonymous with global trends. “This trend in reduction compares with global observations of seeming decline in COVID-19 cases, signifying that the second wave may be receding,” he said. “On 21st of February 2021, 521 new infections and 8 deaths occurred in 20 states. The sustained testing in states has decreased positively. “We are, however, not drawing conclusions yet and certainly not declaring victory, but rather watching developments as they unfold nationally and internationally, ready to make use of comparative advantages that may emerge.”
