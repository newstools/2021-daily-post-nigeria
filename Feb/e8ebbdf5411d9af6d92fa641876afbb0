Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, has denied claims by Governor Yahaya Bello that he has joined the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. Recall that Bello while addressing members of the party on Wednesday said Fani-Kayode joined the party in good faith to add his positive energy. He said Fani-Kayode who was a founding member of the party and left due to misunderstanding, approached him that he would like to join the party. According to him Fani-Kayode, has seen the light and it is his mandate to sanitize, mobilize and educate Nigerians irrespective of their background. But reacting, Fani-Kayode said he has not left the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. He tweeted, “Though we have had meetings across party lines and we are in a season of political consultation I have not left the PDP.”
