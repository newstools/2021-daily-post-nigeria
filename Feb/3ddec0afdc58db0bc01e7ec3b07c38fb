Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted Sheffield United and Chelsea to play a draw when both teams clash in the Premier League on Sunday night. Berbatov also predicted Liverpool and Manchester City to play a draw at Anfield on Sunday, while Manchester United would beat Everton on Saturday night at Old Trafford. According to him, Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal would play a draw with Aston Villa at Villa Park on Saturday afternoon, while Tottenham will thrash West Brom on Sunday afternoon. Providing his predictions, Berbatov told Metro UK: “Liverpool vs Man City A massive game between two teams that are starting to hit top form. I have a feeling City could edge it but, more than anything, I want to see a top of the table clash where both teams go for it and goals are scored at both ends. Prediction: 2-2.” On the Tottenham vs West Brom game, Berbatov said, “If Spurs can’t beat West Brom then they are in real trouble. I think my old club will find a way past Sam Allardyce’s men and win comfortably. Prediction: 3-0.” Commenting on the Sheffield vs Chelsea match, Berbatov said, “It may be too late for the Blades to pull off the great escape, but at least they’re fighting now. I think they can cause Chelsea problems here and take something from the match. Prediction: 1-1.” Speaking on the Aston Villa vs Arsenal match, Berbatov said, “Arsenal’s impressive run came to a halt at Wolves in midweek, and Mikel Arteta will want them to put that behind them here. But Villa have been one of the best team’s this season, and Villa Park is a difficult place for any opponent. Prediction: 1-1.” On the Man United vs Everton clash, Berbatov said, “Man Utd vs Everton United are chasing City at the top of the table and need to make this their second win in a row. Everton are unpredictable, and I see United taking all three points. Prediction: 3-1.”
