Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said Harry Kane just needs to win one more match, to land the first trophy of his career. Kane has recorded double-digit goal tallies in seven straight seasons for Spurs, but has failed to win any silverware. It has led to speculation that the England captain is getting fed up with the drought and could consider leaving. When asked about the situation, Mourinho said beating Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final on April 25, would change the narrative. “To win a trophy, [Kane] just needs to win one game,” Mourinho told reporters. “I know that it is against probably the team that is going to win the Premier League this year, so I think it is a very difficult final that we will have to play. “But to win a trophy, we just need to win a match. You have to ask Harry, but I think ‘to wait’ is not the right way to describe it. Is to fight for it, is to fight for it.”
