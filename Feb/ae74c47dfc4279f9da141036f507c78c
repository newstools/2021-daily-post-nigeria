My first ball, my first team, my first goal… Time flies! “From Madeira to Lisbon, from Lisbon to Manchester, from Manchester to Madrid, from Madrid to Turin, but above all, from the bottom of my heart to the world… I have given everything I could, I never held back and I have always tried to deliver the best possible version of me. “In return, you gave me your love and admiration, your presence and your unconditional support. And for that, I will never be able to thank you enough. I couldn’t have done without you. “As I celebrate my 36th birthday and my 20th year as a professional footballer, I am sorry that I can’t promise you 20 more years of this. But what I can promise you, is that as long as I keep going, you will never receive less than 100 per cent from me! ‘Thank you once again for all your support and for your kind messages and initiatives during this day. It means a lot to me and you all have a special place in my heart.” Ronaldo has won an incredible 29 titles across a club glittering career with Sporting Lisbon, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus.
