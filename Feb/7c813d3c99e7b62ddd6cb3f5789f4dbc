Joe Willock and Ainsley Maitland-Niles have both left Arsenal on Transfer Deadline Day. Willock is heading to Newcastle, where he will spend the rest of the season on loan. The 21-year-old has made 16 appearances across all competitions this season, including seven in the Premier League. However, his last start came in the 2-1 home defeat to Wolves on November 29. Emile Smith Rowe’s emergence has limited Willock’s game time, while Mikel Arteta also brought in Martin Odegaard from Real Madrid this January. Maitland-Niles will also join Premier League basement boys, West Brom, on loan until June 2021. The England international has barely featured for Arsenal this season and will now help the Baggies fight relegation.
