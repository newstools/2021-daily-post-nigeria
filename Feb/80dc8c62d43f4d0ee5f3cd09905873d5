The Yoruba Youth Socio-Cultural Association (YYSA), on Thursday, expressed support for the move by the National Assembly to ban importation and production of bleaching cream in Nigeria. In a statement by its National President, Hammed Olalekan, the group said it was happy that the Federal Legislature “is intending to regulate the importation and production of creams, which people are using to tone their skins’’. “As part of its advocacies to instil right values, right attitudes and behaviours that are acceptable among youths across Nigeria, the YYSA is in full support of this move. “Bleaching is an act of immorality that has become a commonality in Nigeria. “This is because it is generally used by all classes of people in the society including elites. “It’s undoubtedly an epidemic in Nigeria and, if not curtailed, will later lead to an outbreak of cancer, not only among adults but children. “This is for the fact that nursing mothers too are now using it on their infants,’’ Olalekan said. According to the group, severe punishment should also be suggested during the enactment of the law. Recall that the senate, on Tuesday directed the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) to regulate importation, formulation, and sale of cosmetics within Nigeria. Senator Remi Tinubu raised the motion during plenary on Tuesday, urging NAFDAC to wake up to its responsibility of protecting Nigerians against harmful products, especially bleaching cream.
