The Lower Niger Congress (LNC) has demanded different constitutions in Nigeria. The coalition argued that this would put an end to activities of violent Fulani herdsmen. LNC is a union of self-determination organisations in Southern parts of the country. In a statement on Monday, Tony Nnadi, the Secretary General, condemned what he called deliberate antagonism and hostility of some Fulanis. Nnadi noted the people of the South and Middle belt have had enough of violence caused by “herdsmen and armed militias”. The scribe said killings and trespassing onto farms, forests and lands belonging to communities “would not be happening had indigenous people made their own constitutions”. “As things stand, the indigenous people of the Middle-Belt and Southern Nigeria (NINAS) having declared a Constitutional Force Majeure to decommission the illegitimate 1999 Constitution, Nigeria is now a Disputed Project. “It is the expectation of the LNC and the rest of the NINAS Alliance that an honest and timely engagement with the Five Demands of the Constitutional Force Majeure Proclamation will precipitate an orderly process for the resolution of the rapidly degenerating Nigerian Situation”, Nnadi said.
