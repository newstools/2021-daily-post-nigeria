Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, has dismissed claims of defecting to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Fani-Kayode said leaving the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, was never an option. He disclosed this during a meeting with members of the PDP National Working Committee, NWC, led by the party’s National Chairman, Uche Secondus in his residence in Abuja. He said: “We had a very extensive and fruitful meeting and I want to state here and now that, whatever issues there may have been, have been resolved. We are moving forward as one. I never left the PDP, I am in PDP and I am proud to be here. “Whatever the case may be, what is happening in the country now, the best thing for us to do is to build bridges across party lines, across regional, ethnic and religious lines. This is the only way we can be glad to have a country we can call our own.” Recall that Fani-Kayode had met Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and the interim Caretaker Chairman of APC, Mai Mala Buni. Shortly after the meeting, governor Bello had claimed that Fani-Kayode has joined the APC. Bello had said the former minister joined the ruling party to add his positive energy. Fani-Kayode, however, countered Bello’s claim, insisting that he was still a member of PDP.
