Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, has urged the federal government to recruit more security personnel to address the shortage of manpower. NAN reports that he spoke on Monday when members of the National Assembly representing the state paid a visit. The delegation commiserated with the government over the abduction of staff and students of Government Science College, Kagara. Bello noted that the security agencies had been overstretched with insufficient surveillance equipment to manage security challenges. “We have been making all efforts to ensure insecurity is curtailed but it’s being extremely difficult mostly because of manpower shortage and lack of equipment. “The strength of the Police in Niger is just about 4,000. It used to be 14,000 for the state alone. You can see the police are overstretched and I believe it is the same with the military,” he said. The governor called for a collective effort between the lawmakers and the state executives to make the Federal Government expedite action towards the recruitment of more security agents. Bello added that his administration was working tirelessly to secure the release of the captives bandits took last Tuesday night.
