Suspected Fulani herdsmen have reportedly kidnapped one Mrs. Ajoke Ishola on her way to farm along Igbo-Ori, Yewa North Local Government area of Ogun State. DAILY POST gathered that the incident happened around 11am on Monday, hours after four persons were killed at Agbon-Ojodu village in the same Yewa North. Our correspondent learnt that the commercial motorcycle conveying Mrs. Ishola and one other woman was accosted by the suspected herdsmen, who were said to be armed with guns and machetes. A son-in-law to the abducted woman, Engr Aremu Rafiu, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST on Monday. According to Rafiu, “The herdsmen shot the okada rider that carried my mother-in-law and the other woman. The bullet could not affect the okada rider, maybe he has some powers. “But my mother-in-law was taken away, while the other woman was butchered in the head. She is currently receiving treatment at Ayetoro hospital.” Rafiu explained that operatives of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) have begun a search for the abducted women in the bush. Asked if the police had been informed, he replied, “We have not informed the police but OPC members are already in the bush searching for her. “We don’t know why they took her away. Maybe they want to demand ransom or not, we don’t know. They have not contacted us for anything, but we are still searching, praying that she is rescued alive,” he narrated.
