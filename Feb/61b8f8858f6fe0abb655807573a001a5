Four-time NBA champion, LeBron James, has hit back at AC Milan striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, insisting there is no reason he cannot have just a big impact off the court. James has been a force for social change in America, focusing on fighting police brutality and racial injustice against African Americans. The basketball superstar was outspoken about the shooting of Jacob Blake, against Donald Trump and worked with other NBA players to try and get Black people out to vote during the 2020 US election that brought Joe Biden to power. “I am kind of the wrong guy to go at because I do my homework,” James said, after the Los Angeles Lakers beat Portland Trail Blazers 102-93 on Friday night. James was responding to Ibrahimovic’s comments earlier this week, that athletes should “stay out” of politics, mentioning James by name and calling him out over his political activism.
