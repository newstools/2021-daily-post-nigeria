Bashir Bolarinwa, Caretaker Committee Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara, has narrated how he and other party chieftains were attacked on Wednesday. The incident occurred at the Banquet Hall, Ilorin, venue of the membership registration exercise. Bolarinwa told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that they were invited by the Registration Committee headed by John Danboyi for a stakeholders meeting. He recalled that the venue of the parley scheduled for 12 noon was still under lock as at 1.30 pm. The Banquet Hall is a government-owned facility. “When it was around 1.30pm, I sent a message to the chairman of the Registration Committee (Danboyi), expressing surprise that the hall was still under lock and key as at 1.30 pm. “I did not know that some AA members loyal to Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq were already inside the hall. Outside, a lot of people were mobilised; a lot of thugs were outside too, but we were never bothered. “The hall was eventually opened at about 2 p.m; as we were about to enter, a female member of the AA group loyal to the governor came from nowhere and held my shirt and was trying to prevent me from entering the hall.” The chairman said persons around prevented her from causing any havoc and he entered. Bolarinwa explained it was after he entered the hall he noticed majority of the people were AA members. “Sen. Danboyi said he was not happy. But the whole thing had became uncontrollable as thugs had been mobilised. Some of the boys brought guns, they started to attack our people. Many of us sustained injuries, our vehicles were vandalised.” Bolarinwa said the cars of the state woman leader, party stalwart Wahab Adesina, among others were destroyed. Adesina was wounded. “The state Treasurer of the party was beaten to coma, they also took away his car. As I am talking to you now, we don’t know the whereabouts of his car because his car keys were collected from him”, he added.
