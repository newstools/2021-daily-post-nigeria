Batch B, Stream 2 corps members posted to Osun State have been charged to be good ambassadors of the National Youth Service Scheme (NYSC), and their family at their places of primary assignment. The NYSC Osun State Coordinator, Mr. Ayodele Adegoke gave this charge while addressing the corps members at a low-key closing ceremony of the orientation programme for the Batch at the NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp, Ede, recently. According to Mr. Adegoke, the best way to make impact in their various places of primary assignment is for them to have in mind that they are to be good ambassadors of the scheme, their family and Nigeria. In his words, “Be good ambassadors of your family, the scheme and Nigeria if you want to have a successful and hitch free service year.” He reminded them that the scheme has equipped them with relevant skills during their stay in camp as he encouraged them to impact positively on their host community using the skills and positive orientation acquired during the three week orientation. He equally warned against night travels and irrelevant journeys when they get to their places of primary assignment. “Do not travel at night and ensure you obtain written approval of the state coordinator through your LGI whenever there is a need for you to travel,” he added. Adegoke also reminded the corps members that they should endeavour to sensitise their host communities on the need to adhere to the COVID-19 preventive protocols in order to keep everyone safe and curb the spread of the deadly virus.
