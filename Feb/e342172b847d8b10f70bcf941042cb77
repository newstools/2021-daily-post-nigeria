The governor of Ebonyi State David Umahi has threatened to clampdown on stakeholders of Onitsha LGA, the hometown of the acting national vice chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Ali Odefa and other communities for their inability to resolve all communal clashes in their areas. Recall that there have been increased hostilities, killings and destruction of valuable properties by warlords in some communities of the state especially in Isinkwo and Abaomege, Ezza/ Effium communities. It was gathered that political leaders/ stakeholders of Isinkwo and Abaomege, Ezza/ Effium and other communities in Ikwo, Izzi and Abakaliki local government areas allowed warlords to kill and destroy many lives and valuable properties that worth millions of naira. Umahi made this known while briefing journalists shortly after an enlarged state exco meeting which took place at the exco-chamber old government house Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital. The governor who spoke to journalists through the Commissioner of information and State Orientation Mr. Uchenna Orji said political leaders/ stakeholders of the said LGAs will be dealt with by the government if there is further killings or destruction of properties by their stooges. According to him: “the government has looked at the Isinkwo and Abaomege crisis and a report was taken, the executive frowned at the situation and gave a matching order that if there is any further clash between the two communities in Onitsha LGA, the government will hold responsible the leaders of the two communities. “A matching order was given to the leaders of the two communities to stop the communal clashes. For Effium and Ezza Effium crisis, the government did consider the reports on the meetings held by the state government with the stakeholders of Ezza and Effium. “One may commend the stakeholders of the two tribes for commitment towards keeping the Peace of the community. And also ensuring the ceasefire of all hostilities.
