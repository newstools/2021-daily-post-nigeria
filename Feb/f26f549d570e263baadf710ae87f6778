Hundreds of women from Uzuakoli in Bende Local Government Area of Abia State, Tuesday, staged a peaceful protest at Uzuakoli office of the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company, EEDC, over outrageous bills being given to them. The protesting women expressed dissatisfaction with the current hike in the electricity bills and maintained that it is an irreconcilable fact on why people in Uzuakoli will be paying 14,000 and 20,000 Naira while people living in Umuahia, the state capital pay less. The women appealed to the relevant authorities including the EEDC Enugu head office to address the injustice and unwarranted alleged exploitation being meted out to them.  According to them, they are only peasant farmers and cannot afford the outrageous EEDC bills slammed on them even when they only use electric bulbs for light. This was even as residents of Umuahia, the Abia state capital, also cried out over the unholy activities of EEDC, lamenting that the electricity company has failed its responsibilities as the citizens are being subjected to total darkness.
