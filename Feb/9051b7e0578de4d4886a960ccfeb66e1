Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, on Friday, provided injury updates on Alisson Becker, Sadio Mane and Fabinho ahead of his side’s Premier League clash against Manchester City on Sunday evening at Anfield. Mane was ruled out of Liverpool’s last two fixtures against West Ham United and Brighton, while Fabinho has been sidelined for the last three matches. Becker, meanwhile, was unable to feature in the midweek encounter against Brighton due to illness. Speaking at a press conference on Friday afternoon, Klopp said: “Ali feels much better, good enough to have an individual session today. “Sadio and Fab will be in parts of team training today. Then we will see.” Klopp’s men head to the game following a 1-0 defeat against Brighton on Wednesday at Anfield. The Reds are currently seven points behind Premier League leaders Man City on the log. The kick-off time for Liverpool vs Man City is 5:30 pm.
