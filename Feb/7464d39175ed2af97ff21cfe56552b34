The federal government may be forced to close schools down again, as COVID-19 cases continue to spike. The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 National Incident Manager, Mukhtar Muhammed, stated this in a video posted on Twitter on Monday. Muhammed said, “The issue of school reopening is something that the PTF has discussed very extensively. The ministry of education decided to open the schools. Based on our own understanding, it was the states that actually wanted to have the schools reopened. “Now, the PTF is watching this very closely, we are monitoring what is going on and if we find out that cases continue to rise in the country and we start to have incidences in schools, certainly, we will have the schools closed. “In the first instance, we should have delayed opening of the schools but now that the schools are opened, the PTF will continue to monitor very closely with all the schools to ensure that they institute measures and ensure that people follow as much as possible.” Schools across Nigeria were shut down in December 2020 and reopened on January 18, 2021.
