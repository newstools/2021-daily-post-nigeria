Recall that Guinea’s Ministry of Health had reported that four people died of Ebola in a resurgence of the disease that first emerged five years ago. She said “WHO is ramping up readiness and response efforts to this potential resurgence of Ebola in West Africa, a region which suffered so much from Ebola in 2014,’’ Moeti said. Meanwhile, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) recorded a fresh case of Ebola in the North Kivu province of the country.
