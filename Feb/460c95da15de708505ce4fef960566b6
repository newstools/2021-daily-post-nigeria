Lawyer to Elijah Ode, the barber arrested for blasphemy in Kano, has withdrawn. Family sources disclosed that the barrister withdrew due to threats to his life. Kano State Hisbah Corps had arrested a Ode, a Christian and Benue State indigene. The young Nigerian, based in the Sabon Gari area, was accused of giving his customers haircuts that offend the Islamic faith. Ode’s matter came up at the Magistrates’ Court at Jedi Jedi, along court road in Kano. “He informed the court that he would no longer represent the accused citing the publicity the case had received and his personal safety”, rights activist, Leo Igwe said. The case was adjourned until February 16, 2021. There are concerns about Ode’s fate as he currently has no legal representation.
