Management of the Lagos State University (LASU), has postponed all outstanding 2019/2020 first semester examinations until further notice. Mr Ademola Adekoya, Coordinator, Centre for Information, Press and Public Relations, LASU, made this known in a statement. Adekoya said the postponement became necessary after the strike action by the Non-Academic Staff Union (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU). Part of the statement read: “Students, parents and other stakeholders are, hereby, informed of the postponement of all the remaining examination until further notice, pending the time the national industrial action is called off by the unions.” He added that the strike by these unions has affected all academic activities. “All concerned students are, however, advised to continue checking the university website, bulletin and other official information platforms of the university from time to time for a new date for the outstanding examination,” the statement added. Recall NASU, SSANU began strike on Friday to press home their demands, which include rectifying the inconsistencies in the Integrated Payroll Personnel Information System (IPPIS).
