Inter Milan star, Romelu Lukaku, has named Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski as the best player in the world currently. The Belgium international believes Lewandowski, who won the 2019/20 Ballon d’ Or, is a true professional. Lukaku made this known on Tuesday night during a Question & Answer session with fans on his official Twitter handle. He was responding to @sportbible who wanted to know the best player in the world presently. The Twitter user asked, “Who is the best player in world football right now?” And in response, Lukaku said: “Robert Lewandowski. I love his work ethic and his game! True professional.” Lukaku has been impressive for Antonio Conte’s Inter Milan so far this season. The former Manchester United and Chelsea star has scored 17 Serie A goals for Inter.
