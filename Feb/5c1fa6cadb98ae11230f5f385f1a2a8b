Chelsea striker, Timo Werner, has admitted that his team was scared of failing to qualify for the Champions League under Frank Lampard. Werner, speaking with Chelsea’s 5th Stand app, says Thomas Tuchel has already changed the mindset of the players. The Blues are one point behind the top four spots, after winning their last three fixtures in the league. After starting life under their new manager with a draw against Wolves, victories over Burnley, Tottenham and Sheffield United have followed. Chelsea had won just two of their previous eight matches with Lampard in charge before his sacking, which had left them sitting at the ninth place in the table. “If we go back three or four matches, when the manager was not yet here, we were nine or ten points behind the top four. “We watched the table and were like, ‘oh, it might not be so good at the end of the season’. “Now we are really good, back in shape, and I think if we keep going like this we can put more pressure on the other teams,” Werner said. —
