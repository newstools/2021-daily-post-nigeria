A governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State, Mr. Azuka Okwuosa, has said that the ongoing registration and revalidation of membership by the party aligns with the plan of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to test e-voting in the forthcoming governorship election in the state. Okwuosa stated this during an interview with journalists after revalidating his membership status of the party in his home town, Ekwusigo in Anambra State. He said, “In a way you could say that APC is equipping its members for electronic voting, because what this means is that by updating the membership register, the party is rekindling public confidence and ownership of the democratic processes. “Although the party has not decided whether the governorship primary would be by direct or indirect method, whichever way it goes, the choice of the people would reign supreme. Whoever is not comfortable with the membership registration should see the long-term benefits to internal party democracy.” He commended President Muhammadu Buhari, saying that his achievements in the country has made things easy for APC in Southeast, and particularly for Anambra State. He said “By embarking on a long list of infrastructure projects, especially the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway, Enugu-Port Harcourt Road and second Niger Bridge and standardization of the runway at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, the president has made it easy for APC to win in the South east.
