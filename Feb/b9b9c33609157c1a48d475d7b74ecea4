Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has dared Kogi West Senator, Smart Adeyemi to make uncomplimentary comments about him and expect an instant reaction. Wike threw the challenge in reaction to comments by Senator Adeyemi where he referred to Abia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu as a “drunkard”. Senator Smart Adeyemi had during debate on the confirmation of ex-Service Chiefs as Non-Career Ambassadors lashed verbal abuse at Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State, describing him as a drunk. But the Rivers State Governor during a meeting with the Senate Committee on Niger-Delta at Government House, Port Harcourt noted that Adeyemi’s disparaging comment was in utter disrespect to the people of Abia State. He said the Kogi Senator went overboard. “I watched the Senate plenary and even though you have immunity somebody will say a Governor is a drunkard. “I was just watching the Senate President. He should have condemned it. How can he do that to a Governor? How can somebody stand up in the Senate simply because he has immunity and say a Governor is a drunkard? “How can you stand-up and abuse a whole people that elected a drunkard. That was an insult. Anyways, that is Abia people. I wish he could say that to me one day. I will give it back,” Wike warned.
