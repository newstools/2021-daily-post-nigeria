The Ondo State Government has declared Wednesday a work-free day. A statement by the State Head of Service (HoS), Mr Dare Aragbaiye, said the work free day declaration was to mark the swearing in ceremony of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu for a second term in office. Recall that Akeredolu was re-elected governor of Ondo State on October 10, 2020, under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He defeated the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, and the current Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, who contested under the platform of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). The venue of the swearing-in ceremony will take place at the International Culture and Event Center, Igbatoro Road, Akure, the state capital. Meanwhile, the chairperson of the inauguration committee and deputy governor-elect, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, had told newsmen in Akure that the inauguration and all the ancillary activities would be low-key due to the prevailing economic situation in Ondo.
