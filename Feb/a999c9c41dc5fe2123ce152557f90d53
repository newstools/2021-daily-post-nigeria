The Seriki Fulani of Igangan, Saliu Abdulkadri has expressed how much he dreads Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho. Abdulkadri said he gets scared and cold anytime he hears the name of Igboho. He disclosed this during an interview with the BBC on Thursday. Abdulkadri narrated what he experienced when “Igboho and his boys stormed his residence was still fresh in his memory.” The Seriki said he had never experienced nor witnessed such in his life. Abdulkadri, who has relocated to his hometown in Ilorin, Kwara State, stated that the day he heard that Igboho has gone to Ogun State, he “could not sleep.” The Seriki while describing Igboho’s action as heinous, accused the activist of killing “his only brother during the attack on the Fulani community that fateful Friday.” He claimed that he would have been killed if not that he “escaped miraculously.” Recall that the 78-year-old Abdulkadir had accused a politician, Tunji Omolewu, popularly known as Janbele, of being responsible for the attack on him and his people. He disclosed that Janbele led Sunday Igboho to his residence. Abdulkadir had disclosed this while revealing why some people are after him.
