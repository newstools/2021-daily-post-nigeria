A Kwara State High Court sitting in Ilorin, on Thursday, ordered a 21-year old graduate of Kwara state University, KWASU, Malete, to pay N100,000 fine or serve six months jail term. Justice Sikiru Oyinloye, convicted the suspect over offences bordering on love scam. Ahmed, was arraigned before the court, by the Ilorin Zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, on one count charge of internet fraud contrary to Section 95 and punishable under Section 334 of the Penal code. The suspect, a mass communication graduate, pleaded guilty to the charge. The charge sheet read; “That you, Ahmed Bolaji, (Rose Mary) sometime in January 2021, in Ilorin, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, did attempt to cheat by personation, when you pretended to be one Rose Mary, a white female with Gmail account mrose5645@gmail.com, and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 95 of the Penal code and punishable under Section 324 of the same penal code.” Following his plea, an operative of the EFCC, Loveday Godwin, who was called to review the facts of the case, narrated how a reported case of internet fraud led to the arrest of the convict. Godwin, disclosed that Ahmed Bolaji, did not succeed in collecting money from his victims, but wanted to obtain money from one Mr Shawn Smith while fraudulently parading himself as Rosemary. Documents and two mobile phones used as instruments of the crime, were tendered and admitted in evidence. Counsel to the EFCC, Sesan Ola, urged the court to convict Ahmed Bolaji based on his plea and the evidence tendered. Delivering judgement, Justice Oyinloye, said, the evidence placed before the court has shown that the prosecution proved his case beyond reasonable doubts and pronounced him guilty as charged. Justice Oyinloye, however, ordered the convict to pay a sum of N100,000, failure upon which he would serve six months in jail.
