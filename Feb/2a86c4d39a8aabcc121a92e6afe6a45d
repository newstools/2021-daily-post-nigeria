The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has advised Nigerians to stop the panic-buying of Premium Motor Spirit. Suleiman Yakubu, the Public Relations Officer, spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria on Sunday. Long fuel queues have been recorded at filling stations in many states and Abuja. Some stations are refusing to sell petrol in stock, while some have run out of supply. Yakubu said the price of crude oil has gone up and affected the price of products. The spokesman assured that PMS would soon be available in excess as loading had already commenced at depots. “The government and marketers are doing everything possible to ensure that the products are available in every filling station within a few days starting from today,” he said.
