Gov. Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has said the tenure extension granted the Inspector General of Police, IGP, Muhammad Adamu was a huge blessing to the state. The governor expressed appreciation to President Muhammadu Buhari for giving extra three months to the IGP. Sule said this during a meeting involving stakeholders from Awe, Tunga and Ribi, all in Awe Local Government Area of the state, and management of the Dangote Sugar Refinery on Monday in Lafia. While thanking God for all the blessings coming to the state, the governor specifically thanked the President for extending the tenure of the IGP, a son of Nasarawa. Sule was particularly elated that at a time when other heads of security agencies were leaving, the President found Adamu worthy of a tenure extension. The governor also used the opportunity of the meeting to commend the IGP for being a good ambassador of the state as well as his exemplary leadership that earned him recognition to secure a tenure extension. According to Sule, the feat attained by the IGP is a blessing to the state and its people, hence the appreciation to the President for the gesture. “I think this is a huge blessing that has come to us and we should be grateful for that and thank the almighty Allah,” he said.
