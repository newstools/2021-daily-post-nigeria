Tunji ‘Teebillz’ Balogun has placed 1 million dollars reward for anyone, who can go head-to-head against his estranged wife, Tiwa Savage in a music battle. The talent manager made this known on his Instagram page on Wednesday. Sharing a photo of Savage, he wrote; “I respectfully have $1M on mama jamjam on a verzuz from 1900 to 2021. Whoever can challenge her! Just waiting? In a follow-up deleted post, Teebillz said the likes of Davido, Wizkid and Burna Boy cannot challenge Tiwa Savage in a song battle. “I’ve been very quiet on my baby, your David, Burna and Wiz cant top mama ‘On God’,” the post read. TeeBillz and Tiwa Savage alongside their son, Jamil spent Christmas holiday in December 2020 together in Dubai. Recall Savage and Teebillz got married in 2013 in one of the most well-attended celebrity weddings of the decade. However, things changed in 2016 after the couple went on social media to call each other out over infidelity.
