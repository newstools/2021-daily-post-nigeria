A Magistrate Court sitting in Port Harcourt has sentenced a young lady, Joy Olaka-Nwogu to twelve years imprisonment with hard labour after being convicted of child trafficking. 22-year old Joy was sentenced to four years in each of the three counts of child trafficking, conspiracy and theft which is expected to run concurrently. Joy Olaka-Wogu was reported to have stolen and sold the first child in the sum of thirty thousand naira but was caught in her attempt to steal twin children in 2018 before she was arraigned in court. She had initially pleaded not guilty to the charges but thereafter changed her plea to guilty after informing the court of her repentance. Chief Magistrate Amaka Amanze in her judgment Thursday said the facts available proved that Joy has been in the business of stealing and selling babies for a while. Speaking to newsmen outside the court, Prosecution Counsel, Esther Achor who is a representative of the International Federation of Female Lawyers, FIDA said the judgment will serve as a deterrent to those who may want to indulge themselves in such activities. “Well, we are satisfied with the judgment of the court because she was remorseful. You heard when she told the court that she has repented and regrets her actions. “And the judgment is fair enough because she was sentenced to four years in prison that will run concurrently. She’s been remanded for almost two years now, meaning she has just about two years more to serve. “As you know, this case of child trafficking is on the increase across the country. We hope that this will serve as a deterrent to other child traffickers that the law will always catch up with them. The convict, Joy Olaka-Wogu was 20 years old as of 2018 when she was first arrested.
