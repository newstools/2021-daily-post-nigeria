Eyewitnesses said the bandits shot sporadically into the air to scare residence without help from the police and carried away three persons. Confirming the attack, the local government chairman, Hon. Mohammed Baba Nna said the bandits invaded the town in an operation that lasted three hours. He also explained that presently the whereabouts of the three people abducted were still unknown. “They came with very sophisticated weapons and I am sure that’s why the Policemen were afraid to come to their rescue during the incident.” It was further gathered that the bandits came in a large number allegedly armed with AK 47, magazine and rocket launcher to the town. When contacted for confirmation, the state Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Wasiu Abiodun promised to revert with details from its station.
