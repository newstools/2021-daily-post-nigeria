Chelsea have reached an agreement to sign Bayern Munich defender, Jerome Boateng, according to Todofichajes. Boateng will join the Blues at the end of this current season. The Premier League have agreed a deal in principle with agents of the 32-year-old Germany international. He is now set to move to Stamford Bridge on a free transfer when his contract expires in the summer. Boateng, who has previously featured in the Premier League with Manchester City, has played 17 Bundesliga games for Bayern this term. The defender will work under compatriot Thomas Tuchel, who recently replaced Frank Lampard.
