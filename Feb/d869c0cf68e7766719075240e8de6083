Arsenal have opened an investigation to determine if their captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, breached the club’s COVID-19 protocols. The club’s chiefs will speak with the 31-year-old, after a footage of him getting a new tattoo, appeared on social media. There are suggestions that Aubameyang, who scored a hat-trick as the Gunners beat Leeds United 4-2 on Sunday, may have broken lockdown rules. In the video, Aubameyang could be seen getting new inking on the Instagram account of Spanish tattoo artist, Alejandro Nicolas Bernal. Neither Aubameyang nor Bernal were wearing masks. Current UK Government regulations stipulate that all tattoo parlours must remain closed. A statement from Arsenal said: “We will speak to the player about this matter and establish what has taken place.”
