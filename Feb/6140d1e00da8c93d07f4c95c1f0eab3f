The National Working Committee (NWC) of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is reportedly divided over zoning of the 2023 presidency. Some NWC members were said to have voiced opposition to the party’s direction. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, has denied any split. He spoke to reporters on Wednesday in Abuja after the NWC meeting. “We have no issue in NWC, we are not aware of what is being put out. The NWC is one united and indivisible body. “We have a responsibility given to us by members of the party to ensure that we lead the party to victory in 2023. The party is walking in that direction,” he said. Ologbondiyan assured the party was working underground to make sure it came out better. The spokesman added that PDP was yet to take decision on zoning for 2023 presidential election.
