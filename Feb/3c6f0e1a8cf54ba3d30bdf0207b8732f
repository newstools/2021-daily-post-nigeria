Four persons were on Sunday burnt to death in an accident involving a 14-passenger commercial bus at Atoyo, inbound Ogbere on Ijebu Ode -Benin expressway. The Public Relations Officer, Ogun Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), Mr Babatunde Akinbiyi, who confirmed the incident to NAN said the accident occurred around 11:50am. Akinbiyi said the accident was caused by brake failure and disobedience on the part of the driver of the bus. “A tanker loaded with black oil inbound Benin through the Ijebu Ode-Benin expressway, spilt its content on the road due to leakage from the tanker and had to stop when the attention of the driver was called by other drivers driving in the same direction. “However, when TRACE, Federal Road Safety Corps and the police got to the scene, they had to divert and re-route traffic, so that inbound traffic to Benin could join the outbound traffic section. He further stated that the driver of the commercial bus disobeyed the warning at the diversion point and drove on the black oil. ‘The driver experienced a brake failure, lost control and ran into the bush hitting a tree in the process before the vehicle was engulfed in fire, burning four passengers to death out of the 14 onboard the bus. “The whereabouts of the remaining 10 can not be ascertained as at the time of filing this report,” he said. He said the deceased were burnt beyond recognition, adding that the number plate of the vehicle could not be ascertained. The TRACE spokesman called on drivers, particularly, commercial vehicle drivers to cooperate and show understanding with traffic managers to make the road safe for all users
