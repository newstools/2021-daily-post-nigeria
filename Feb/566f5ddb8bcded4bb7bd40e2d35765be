The Chidi-Ibeh-led faction of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo said Igbo deities were now “in charge” of the national headquarters of Ohanaeze Ndigbo. Kalu Uduma, spokesman to the faction apex Igbo group, gave the warning in a a statement on Monday. Uduma recalled that the Chidi ibeh-led faction shutdown the Igbo headquarters due to the dilapidated buildings and deplorable state. “We discovered with rude shock that Igbo deities had taken over the Enugu secretariat. A section was buried with charms and shrines erected with fetish substances in one the dilapidated hall.” Uduma said the development was the “evidence of desperation of people who had illegal election in Owerri”. He noted that Chidi Ibeh declared February 20th as Igbo day of atonement “to cleanse the land”. “Ohanaeze Ndigbo secretariat remained shutdown until after the cleansing, anyone who trespass without fortifications, the gods of the land might strike”, the statement added.
