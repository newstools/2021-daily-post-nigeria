The former Governor of Borno State and a chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC), Ali Modu Sheriff, has begun meetings with state governors over his national chairmanship ambition. Speaking to reporters shortly after meeting with the Jigawa State Governor, Muhammad Badaru Abubakar, Sheriff said he cannot fully kick off his campaign for the party chairmanship race without consulting state governors. According to him, “No doubt, governors of our great party – APC are the engine room of the party and one cannot do anything tangible without consulting them.” Sheriff said, “Today, our party needs a resilient leadership that knows what it takes to salvage it and I’m a more committed person that would do just that.” The former governor hinted that he was meeting with the Jigawa State Governor because he is one of the top respected chieftains of the APC, who is known for his dogged commitment to the betterment of party loyalists. He added, “Whatever one is doing as far as APC is concerned in Nigeria, you have to consult Badaru because of his position among leaders in the nation and my ambitions could only be achieved if I consult governors.” Sheriff, who held two hours meeting with Governor Badaru behind a closed-door, insisted that he is the best material to be the chairman of the APC.
