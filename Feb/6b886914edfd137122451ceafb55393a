However, despite being a well known actress, she is not known for flaunting her spouse on social media. Nse Ikpe-Etim while appearing on TVC, said her life as an actress had been criticised by everyone and she does not want that to happen to her husband. “Love makes me keep him away. My life because of my profession as an actress has been criticised and i’ve come to live with him but I don’t want my husband to have that. “It is a personal choice, I want to be selfish with him. “I do not criticise those who put out their relationship on social media and don’t think mine is perfect. It is not for you to see it’s perfect but I am comfortable with the fact I have something I can call mine and not share with anyone,” she said.
