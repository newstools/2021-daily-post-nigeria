Unknown persons detonated dynamite at the secretariat of the People’s Democratic Party on Aba road, in Rivers State; venue of the councillorship primary election for the party, ahead of the local council polls in the state. Reports say the dynamite was detonated by some men who drove in an SUV, leaving party supporters who were at the venue of the primaries to scamper for safety. “There was panic as two dynamites exploded during the councillorship primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party. I was at the party secretariat. The dynamite was detonated by suspected bombers in an SUV car along the Aba road office of the party secretariat at about 3pm,” an eyewitness said. Another eyewitness, who pleaded anonymity, said, “Some people are desperate about this council elections in many local government areas. We just saw an SUV zoom off after the explosion. We don’t know the Local government area they came from.” The Rivers State Police Command is yet to react to the development. State Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Tambari Sydney Gbara, failed to receive telephone calls put to him to comment on the matter. Meanwhile, calm has so far returned to the PDP secretariat after the re-enforcement of security agencies. Rivers State is heading for another round of Local council elections in April, as the tenure of the incumbent LGA administrators expires in June this year.
