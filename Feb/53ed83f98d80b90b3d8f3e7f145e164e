Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, refused to blame David Luiz and Bernd Leno for the red cards they received during a 2-1 defeat to Wolves on Tuesday night. The Gunners took the lead in the first half, thanks to Nicolas Pepe’s fine solo goal. However, it went downhill from there. Luiz was sent off for a last-man tackle in the dying minutes of the half and a penalty was awarded. Ruben Neves stepped up to make it 1-1. Leno was then sent off for handling the ball outside the area, as he rushed off his line to stop an attack. When asked about Luiz’s sending off, Arteta said after the game: “I’ve just seen the replay ten times in five different angles and I cannot see any contact.” The Spaniard also defended Leno, saying “I imagine he makes the decision in a split of a second and naturally he tries to stop the ball. There’s nothing he can do.”
