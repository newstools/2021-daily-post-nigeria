Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has identified two areas his team must improve after beating Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 in the Premier League on Thursday night. Tuchel, who was delighted after securing a win over Jose Mourinho’s men, said Chelsea must improve more on their ‘killer instinct’ in front of goal and aggressiveness in the box. The former Paris Saint-German boss picked up a second win from his first three matches as Chelsea coach, thanks to Jorginho’s first-half penalty at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. “Every experience we make is a step forward if we are opening to learning from it,” Tuchel told BT Sport. “The whole first half we totally controlled the game, very high up the pitch. Maybe we lost confidence in the second half because we lost the ball possession. “We never lost our belief or structure. If it is necessary to suffer, you have to suffer. “A bit more killer instinct and more aggressive in the box, it would have been nice to decide, and there were chances we lacked a bit of determination in the box. “It was a big win in an away game, and I am very happy.” He added, “It is not only about tactics, about how we play and live it. “They lived it 100 per cent with full power and intensity. We never lost the belief, faith or courage to push high and for that, you have to be brave, and we were and the winners in the end.” The results mean Chelsea are now in the 6th position on the Premier League table with 36 points from 22 matches.
