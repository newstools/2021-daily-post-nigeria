Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, will wait until this season ends, before deciding on Jose Mourinho’s future as manager of the club, ESPN reports. Mourinho is under increasing pressure at the North London side after they slumped to ninth place in the Premier League. The Spurs have lost four times in their last five games. It is believed it would cost Levy around £30 million to sack Mourinho since he has a contract without a break clause until the summer of 2023. But it is not just the financial situation that is delaying a decision over the 58-year-old. Tottenham faces Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final in April and Mourinho can continue to fend off criticism, by insisting Spurs have a chance of winning silverware for the first time since 2008.
