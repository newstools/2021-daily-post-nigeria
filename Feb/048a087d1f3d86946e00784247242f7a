Two Nigerian players, Victor Moses and Semi Ajayi, were given marching orders while featuring for their respective clubs on Saturday. Moses was sent off as Spartak Moscow lost 2-0 to Dinamo Moscow in Russia. With nine minutes left, the Chelsea loanee was given a second yellow card by referee Kirill Levnikov. The 30-year-old had already been cautioned in the 15th minute of the encounter. That is the third time the former Wigan Athletic, Liverpool and Inter Milan man would be given his marching orders in his professional career. Ajayi received his first red card in the Premier League, after blocking a possible goal with his hand against Burnley. The West Brom defender was judged by the VAR to have blocked Matej Vydraâ€™s potential goalscoring opportunity in the 34th minute by the use of his hand. Initially, referee Mike Dean waved play on, but a protest from the Burnley players forced him to visit the video review by the pitchside, which subsequently found the 27-year-old guilty of a foul.
