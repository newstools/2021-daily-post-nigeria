The Presidency has asked the Nigeria Police Force to publish the names of Fulani herders undergoing trials across the country. The Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, stated this while speaking on Channels Television’s ‘Sunrise Daily’ programme. Shehu insisted that Buhari, who is also of the Fulani ethnic stock, is not complicit in the herdsmen crisis that is rocking many parts of Nigeria. He said, “The president is more than concerned regarding the ongoing situation. He is fully conscious of the fact that it is the responsibility of his government to work with Nigerians to secure lives and stop the ongoing crisis whether they are kidnappings or the new line of ethnic violence. He condemns it and he does not support it.” Shehu also claimed that many criminal Fulani herders are being prosecuted. “I hope the headquarters of the police will take responsibility and publish the full list of Fulani herders who are undergoing trials in various states, particularly in Benue State. “Trials are going on, convictions have been made and the president cannot be complicit. It is very uncharitable. The president cannot be complicit in the kinds of things being said of him,” he added.
