World War II veteran, Capt. Sir Tom Moore is dead. Moore passed away on Tuesday after he was placed under care for coronavirus. He was 100 years old. It is believed the late ex-soldier was not vaccinated against the virus due to the medication he was receiving for pneumonia. “The last year of our father’s life was nothing short of remarkable. He was rejuvenated and experienced things he’d only ever dreamed of”, the family said. “Whilst he’d been in so many hearts for just a short time, he was an incredible father and grandfather, and he will stay alive in our hearts forever.’’ In 2020, Capt. Sir Tom Moore planned to raise 1,000 pounds for Britain’s National Health Service by walking 100 laps of his backyard. His act during the first wave of COVID-19 raised over 33 million pounds through donations from around the world. Moore was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for the charitable campaign.
