Former Liverpool midfielder, Graeme Souness, has blamed Chelsea striker, Timo Werner, for the sack of manager, Frank Lampard. Souness said Werner’s lack of form in front of goal played a role in Lampard’s departure at Stamford Bridge. He added that the Germany international, who has not scored in 14 Premier League games for Chelsea, is too “timid” for the English top-flight league. Recall that Lampard was sacked last month by Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, after he guided the Blues to beat Luton Town 3-1 in the FA Cup fourth-round tie. The Chelsea legend was replaced by former Paris Saint-German coach, Thomas Tuchel. “At no time does he [Timo Werner] look, so he does not know Mason Mount is coming, so he gets lucky there,” Souness told Sky Sports when analysing Chelsea’s first goal against Sheffield United on Sunday night. “If you watch him at no time does he look to see Mason Mount coming into the middle, he’s just played it into an area. “I think he will find our football difficult – he’s finding it difficult. “I think the aggression and intensity, I think he is a little timid for our football. “If he is going to be a success in our football that has to come. It’s alright saying, ‘he keeps missing chances, he’s getting there’. “I look at him and I am yet to be convinced. Chelsea is a team full of really good players, high technique, they get into the last third and attacking third time and time again, they need more than what he is giving them. “If he had done the business Frank [Lampard] would still be in a job.”
