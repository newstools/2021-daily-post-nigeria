Southwest governors and traditional rulers have met to appraise the security situation of the zone. The meeting was held in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, on Saturday. Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State and Chairman of the Southwest Governors Forum spoke at the end of the meeting. He said though the parley was at the instance of the presidency, the Chief of Staff to the President, Ibrahim Gambari, the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu and the Director-General of the Department of State Services could not fly out of Abuja due to bad weather. Akeredolu said governors and the traditional rulers, however, decided to continue the meeting to appraise the security situation in the zone. A statement by Governor Seyi Makinde’s spokesman, Taiwo Adisa, indicated that Akeredolu read a three-point communique. “That the meeting supported the decision of the National Economic Council (NEC) on forest management; that the nation’s borders need to be fully secured and protected; that open grazing must be checked and that media practitioners must assist the country to end fake news,” he said. In attendance were Governors Makinde, Akeredolu, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, Gboyega Oyetola of Osun and Dapo Abiodun of Ogun. Others were the Deputy Inspector General of Police (South-West), David Folawiyo and security chiefs serving in Oyo, Chairmen of Council of Traditional Rulers in each of the South-West states and some first-class monarchs.
