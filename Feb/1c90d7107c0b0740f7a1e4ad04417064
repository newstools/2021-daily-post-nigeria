The federal government says Nigeria is making efforts to get the coronavirus vaccines by the end of February. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, made the disclosure to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. He said Nigeria was expecting vaccines from China. “What we are engaging with China is in the area of vaccines for COVID-19. We are also looking to import, to acquire significant vaccines from China and other partners too. “I think in the short immediate time, that is an area we will need China. They have cooperated with us with regards to personal protective equipment and other things in our COVID response.” Noting that Nigeria is exploring all options, Onyeama said the country was similarly considering the bilateral way. He added that the African Union (AU) was collectively working to receive the vaccine. On Saturday, the World Health Organization (WHO) refuted reports that Nigeria had been disqualified from receiving doses.
