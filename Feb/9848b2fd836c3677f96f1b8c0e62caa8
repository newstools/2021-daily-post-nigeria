This directive was confirmed by the command’s spokesman, Muyiwa Adejobi, on Monday. According to Adejobi, the police officers have also laid siege to five other locations in the state. “Our policemen are still at the tollgate, it is a deployment and we are working with an operation order and until there is a stand-down order of the operation from the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, the men will still be there. “We have not arrested anyone today, there was no breakdown of law and order, no gathering or procession, everything is normal in the area. “But we are still maintaining our ground there and we have deployment in about five places aside from the Lekki tollgate and our men are still on standby at these strategic places. “We have police deployment in Unity Park, Gani Fawehinmi Park, Ogombo Junction, Adeniran Ogunsanya Junction, among others,” he said. Policemen were initially deployed to the Lekki tollgate, ahead of the #OccupyLekkiTollGate and #DefendLagos protests scheduled for February 13, 2021. They arrested over 40 protesters at the tollgate including popular comedian, Mr. Macaroni.
