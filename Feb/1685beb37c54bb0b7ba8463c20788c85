The Osun State Government has shut down the Riverside Lounge in the Oke-fia area of Osogbo, for failing to observe COVID-19 guidelines. The facility was shut by officers of the Osun State Joint Task Force on COVID-19 while monitoring compliance with the government’s guidelines on the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Recall that the government had released some non-pharmaceutical safety protocols some weeks ago, as part of measures to manage the second wave of COVID-19. The government had warned through the guidelines that any hotel, event centre, mall, joint or business outlet found flouting the safety directives would be sealed and only reopened upon the payment of a fine of N 250,000. Part of the guidelines directed eateries, restaurants, joints and bars to only operate at 50 percent capacity and ensure adequate physical distancing of customers. It also warned that the “No face mask, no entry” policy be observed in every eatery, restaurant, joint and bar, while operators and attendants must also wear their face masks at all times. Recall that DAILY POST had reported that the State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu had said the state task force on COVID-19 would soon inspect venues who contravene the stipulated guidelines.
