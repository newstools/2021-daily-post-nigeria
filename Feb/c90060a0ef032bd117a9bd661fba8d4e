Shehu Sani, a former Kaduna Central Senator, has condemned the attack on Fulani herdsmen and their cattle in Abia State. Sani lamented that government should not allow any group or individual to take the laws into their hands. Nnamdi Kanu, the acclaimed leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, had shared a video of the group’s Eastern Security Network, ESN, chasing and slaughtering cows belonging to herdsmen in Abia State. ESN had invaded a camp of the herdsmen in Isiukwuato, Abia State. Sharing a video of the incident, Kanu wrote on his Facebook page: “Video of men at work last night across all the towns and villages of the old Bende Division, especially Isiukwuato.” Reacting, the former Senator urged the federal government and Northern states to set up a ranching program that would resettle herdsmen in the North. In a post on his Facebook, Sani wrote: “The unprovoked attacks on the Fulani cattle rearers and their cattle in Abia State is unreservedly a condemnable act. “No group of individuals should be allowed to take the laws into their hands for the sake of peace, unity and stability of the country. “The Federal Government and the Northern states must step up action and commence the grazing or ranching programs that will resettle the herdsmen and their cattle in the north.”
