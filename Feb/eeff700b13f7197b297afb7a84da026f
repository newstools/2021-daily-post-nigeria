Former Arsenal Manager, Arsene Wenger has said that both Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi need better teammates in their respective clubs. The legendary manager noted that both Juventus and Barcelona are overly reliant on the two superstars. While Juventus fell 2-1 to FC Porto in Portugal, Barcelona suffered a 4-1 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last 16 with both Ronaldo and Messi leading their various teams. Messi fired Barcelona into the lead from the spot-kick, but a Kylian Mbappe-inspired hat-trick sealed a successful comeback for the French side. Speaking on beIN SPORTS, Wenger pointed out that Juventus’ reliant on Ronaldo showed that the “players around him just aren’t good enough. “It’s a problem that [Juve] are only relying on Ronaldo. “It’s the same for Messi. If the team is overly reliant on Messi, it’s because the players around him are not good enough.” Juventus will welcome Porto to Turin for the second leg on March 9 but before then, they will play four Serie A fixtures. In the same vein, Barcelona will have to play four La Liga matches and their second-leg Copa del Rey semi-final clash with Sevilla before travelling to Paris for the second leg tie on 10th March.
