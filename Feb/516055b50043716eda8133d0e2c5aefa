Asensi explained that people are disrespecting Messi, adding that they want him to retire early. “People are disrespecting Messi,” Asensi told Radio MARCA. “They want to make him retire early. “I can’t understand how you can be against Messi and how someone at Barcelona can question him after being the best player for ten years. “You have to build him a monument, and the day Messi leaves Barcelona, many will cry because they are treating him badly, and he doesn’t deserve all this.” Messi has won six Ballon d’ Or awards in his glittering career so far at Barcelona.
