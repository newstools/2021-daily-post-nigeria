A group of persons believed to be bandits on Monday stormed Gidan Goga Community of Maradun Local Government Area in Zamfara State, killing three persons, kidnapping eleven persons and injuring so many others. An eyewitness from the community, Musa Lawali of Gidan Goga, said the armed bandits stormed the village at the wee hours of Monday without any intervention from any security operatives. The eyewitness explained that as soon as the bandits entered the community, they unleashed terror on residents who ran away to save their lives. “Everyone was perplexed as they started shooting. There was no security operative to challenge them, even though the operation lasted for several hours” he lamented. Gidan Goga said the armed bandits moved to the residence of one Alhaji Yusuf Gidan Goga and kidnapped him, his two sons and their wives who were said to have gotten married only a few days earlier. He lamented that since after the deadly operation that lasted for hours, the villagers have since deserted the community as they were afraid that the armed bandits may return for another gory attack. Gidan Goga appealed to the state and federal governments to do something serious about the banditry issue in the state, pointing out that it has gone out of hand. When contacted, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Abutu Yaro who spoke through the police, Public Relations Officer, SP Mohammed Shehu confirmed the incident. SP Shehu said the command has deployed teams of Anti-terrorism squadron to the axis to fish out the perpetrators and ensure the security of the area.
