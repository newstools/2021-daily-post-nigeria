Nigerian Disk Jockey, Obianuju Catherine Udeh, also known as DJ Switch, has reacted to the ban on crypto currency transactions or crypto exchanges in Nigeria by the Central Bank. CBN on Friday in a circular signed by Director of Banking Supervision, Bello Hassan instructed all financial institutions in the country to close accounts of those engaged in crypto transactions. The apex bank also warned that a breach of the directive will attract severe regulatory sanctions. However, Dj Switch while reacting to the development on her Twitter page alleged that Nigeria is run by ‘ill-informed and backward promoting dinosaurs’ She advised the government to rather use its time in investigating accounts of sponsors of terrorism in the country rather than make such decrees. Her tweet read: “If the ban on crypto by CBN is true ehn, it points yet again to the ill-informed, backward, poverty promoting dinosaurs leading us. “Use your time to investigate and close accounts sponsoring terrorists in the country if you don’t know what to do!
