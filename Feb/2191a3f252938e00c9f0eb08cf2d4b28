Suspected hoodlums on Monday attacked a police checkpoint at Ikpe Annang junction in Essien Udim Local government of Akwa Ibom State killing one Police Inspector. According to an eyewitness, Nsibiet Idiong, the attack could be a reprisal as hoodlums on motorcycles fired gunshots randomly at the officers who scampered for safety leaving the Police Inspector inside the van. He explained, “The attack we believe is a reprisal case because Police operatives have been terrorizing hoodlums, armed robbers and other categories of criminals in the neighbouring Local Government Areas of Essien Udim, Ikot Ekpene and Obot Akara. “When the other Policemen escaped, the gunmen set the Hilux van on fire with the Policeman inside and perhaps, he must still have been sleeping when the armed men suddenly launched the attack.” Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Odiko Macdon assured that swift investigation had since been ordered by the Commissioner of Police (CP), Mr. Amiengheme Andrew. Macdon said: “The Command has confirmed the news of the unfortunate incident at Ikpe Annang junction, which led to the death of one of our personnel. “While the CP is saddened by this development and condoles with the deceased’s family, he has ordered a discreet investigation and vowed to bring perpetrators to book”.
