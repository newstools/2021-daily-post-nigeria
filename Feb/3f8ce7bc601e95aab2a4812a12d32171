Bala Mohammed, the Governor of Bauchi State has said that bandits terrorising the North are not only from the Fulani ethnic group. According to him, there are the Igbo, the Yoruba and the Hausa who are the real beneficiaries of the illicit trade. Speaking on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily on Friday, the Governor said, “These bandits are not only Fulanis. “In fact, they are terrorising the Fulanis but they have Fulani miscreants within them; they have Hausa, they have Igbo suppliers; they have Yorubas. They’re people really benefitting from the illicit trade.” Speaking further, Mohammed said he has not changed his mind on his recent comment that herders have no option but to carry AK-47 for self-defence because they are being attacked and killed by cattle rustlers. “I have not changed my opinion on the issue; I was not defending herdsmen,” he said. The Governor also said that “It seems the security agencies have thrown in the towel; are mesmerized,” on the security situation in the country.
