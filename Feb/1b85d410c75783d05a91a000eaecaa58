Senator Kabiru Garba who was leading a faction of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Zamfara State has explained to his loyalists the reason behind his reconciliation with former Governor Abdul Aziz Yari. Marafa assured that he was very much ready for genuine reconciliation to pave way for the progress and development of APC and the state in general. This was contained in a press statement signed and made available to newsmen in Gusau, Zamfara State capital by the senator, saying that the meeting was held in Kaduna with some members of his faction. According to the statement, Senator Marafa noted that the purpose of the meeting in Kaduna was to brief members of his faction about their recent meeting with the leadership of the APC in Abuja and the next line of action which is surely genuine reconciliation. It could be recalled that the chairman of the caretaker committee of APC, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State had on Monday in Abuja met with Senator Kabiru Marafa and other stakeholders of the party from Zamfara State to address the lingering crisis that had created cracks on the walls of the party in the state. He said during the Abuja meeting, they all agreed to come together and work for the benefit of the members of the party in the state. “It is in fulfilment of that pledge that I convened the meeting with some critical stakeholders of my faction, from all the 14 Local Government Areas of the State to actualise the reconciliation and peace movement initiated by the party’s national headquarters in Abuja” he added. Senator Marafa noted that as peace-loving and loyal party members, they were ready for a genuine reconciliation where all would be carried along. He expressed hope that the two factions of APC in the State have now come together under one united All Progressive Congress (APC).
