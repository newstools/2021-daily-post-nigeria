President Muhammadu Buhari has reportedly asked Inspector General of Police, IGP, Mohammed Adamu to hand over, according to the Nation. The Nasarawa-born Adamu, who was appointed on January 15, 2019, completed his 35 years service on Monday. Adamu, the 20th Inspector-General of Police, was expected to have handed over to the most senior officer at the close of work on Monday. However, there are insinuations that Buhari may extend his service as he did with the service chiefs before they were finally dismissed last week. The retiring Adamu was at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport to receive President Buhari who returned from his hometown, Daura, Katsina State after a four-day trip. The Nation reports that Adamu was told of his fate after Buhari’s arrival, quoting a top source at the presidency. “The IGP has been asked by the President to handover,” the source said. “Adamu was waiting for the presidential directive. He would have left on Monday but it will be discourteous to have exited without a clear-cut directive from the President and Commander-In-Chief. “He may likely hand over to the most senior deputy inspector-general of Police. I am aware Adamu was yesterday putting finishing touches to his handover note.” There were speculations on social media last night that AIG Zanna Ibrahim might be appointed the new Inspector General of Police.
