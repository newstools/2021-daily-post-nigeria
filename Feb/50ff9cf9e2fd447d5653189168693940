The leadership of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, NSCIA, has expressed worry about the security alert issued by the Department of State Services (DSS). NSCIA urged DSS to arrest and prosecute those threatening violence in Nigeria. DSS spokesman, Peter Afunanya had raised the alarm over the alleged plot by some persons to incite religious and ethnic violence in the country. Reacting, the Islamic group in a statement by its spokesman, Ibrahim Aselemi, called on Nigerians to expose criminals and their hideouts. The statement reads: “We fervently appeal to these faceless yet-to-be-identified persons planning to subvert public peace and order in the country to sheath their swords. “On our part, we shall continue to advocate for respect for the religious beliefs of all and peaceful religious coexistence in Nigeria. We sincerely believe that we are greater together. “The Council will like to use this medium to applaud the majority of Nigerians for their tenacity in the defence of the unity and diversity of the country. “We hereby call on the security apparatus especially the DSS to fish out these enemies of the State and deal with them according to the law. This is because it is only when criminal elements are punished that we can effectively give potency to deterrence. “We call on Nigerians to help the security apparatus with credible information on criminals and their hideouts . We cannot leave security matters to security agencies alone. If you see something, say something.”
