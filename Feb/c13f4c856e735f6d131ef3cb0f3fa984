Simeon Eze, an ex-Personal Assistant to former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Security and Protocols, has joined the All Progressives Congress (APC). Eze, from Echara/Isiagu Ward in Igboeze-South Local Government Area of Enugu State, joined the APC on Tuesday. NAN reports that he registered at the local government party secretariat in Ibagwa-Aka. Jonathan Zwingina, the Chairman of APC Registration and Revalidation Committee in Enugu, attended the event. Also present were Ben Nwoye, State Caretaker Committee Chairman and some executives and party chieftains. The APC also received some Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) youths from Unadu Ward of the LGA. “I decided to join the ruling party at the centre because President Buhari has done very well especially in his war against corruption. “I will support APC to change the narrative in Enugu state. A situation where PDP wins all the elective positions in the state will longer be possible in 2023,” he said. Eze, who was PA to Obasanjo from 1999 to 2007, said it was his first time joining a political party.
