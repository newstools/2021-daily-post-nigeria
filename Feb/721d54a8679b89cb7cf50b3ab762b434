Electricity consumers have bemoaned the power outage recently experienced in some parts of Osogbo, the Osun State capital. DAILY POST reports that during the weekend, most parts of the state capital experienced electricity outage which affected business activities and households.

While speaking with DAILY POST, the spokesperson of the Osun District of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC), Kikelomo Owoeye, confirmed that there was a long outage only on Saturday and Sunday in Osogbo township.

On the overnight power outage experienced in Ogo-Oluwa, the IBEDC spokesperson also revealed that “Only Gbongan road was affected over the night due to an explosion at the control room which affected an up riser cable”.
Ogo-Oluwa said the IBEDC technical team was already at the control room to rectify the fault and that power will be restored as soon as the fault is cleared.
