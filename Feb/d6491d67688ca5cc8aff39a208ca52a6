The Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, Kayode Fayemi, on Tuesday, said that Nigeria is witnessing terrorism. Fayemi disclosed this when he paid a visit to Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State. The Ekiti State governor made the declaration amid the abducting of students and some members of staff of Government Science College, Kagara in Niger State by bandits last week. Fayemi said, “At the level of the governors’ forum, we met last week, and we came out with some specific ideas we have shared with the federal authority, but for us, our visit is in commiseration, solidarity and in identifying with you, the government, and the good people of Niger State. “We want to reassure you that even this difficult time shall pass, but we must put our heads together, put all our efforts together, demonstrate resilience, reassure our people not to give up hope because ultimately we can only defeat terrorism collectively, not in isolation. “What we are witnessing is terrorism. There is no other name for it. We may call it banditry, kidnapping. These are the remnants of the actors in the North-East that have found themselves in other parts of the country. Whether they’re known as ISWAP, Shekau faction, they are remnants of what we’re still dealing with in that part of Nigeria. “That is why we must not treat the North-East in isolation of this problem. We are all victims as long as any section of our country is ravaged by this problem. “On behalf of all your brother governors, I want to assure our people in Niger State that we’re all for Niger State. We shall not rest until we resolve the challenges we’ve here as we have in other states.”
