Former Imo State Governor, Ikedi Ohakim, has responded to inquiries about his purported defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC). On Thursday, Ohakim said he was yet to decamp to the APC or another party, adding that such a decision would be made public. A statement on his behalf by Austine Otuokere, noted that Ohakim understood that the current political atmosphere in the country gives room for speculations. “Camp changing by a person of his caliber and pedigree is not something he could smuggle into the internet”, it read. Otuokere said Ohakim was aware of the sweeping enthusiasm of Nigerians across the different states to join the ruling party. “Any moves by him in a similar direction must be in the full glare of all Nigerians and with the full participation of members of his political family, thus offering a photo opportunity for a reliable communication of his current political preferences. “Dr. Ohakim, therefore, wishes to seize this opportunity to enjoin his political associates, supporters and numerous admirers alike to disregard this rumour and await any further possible directives and communication from him”, the statement added.
