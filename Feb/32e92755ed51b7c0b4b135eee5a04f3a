Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has issued a serious warning to Fulani herdsmen in the South Eastern states. The IPOB leader also called on former Governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu to, as a matter of urgency, make public, the boundaries of the settlement he gave to Fulani herdsmen during his tenure. According to the IPOB leader, a few years ago Kalu allegedly gave out a sizeable chunk of Igbo land at Lopka for free to those we now know to be Fulani herdsmen. “We are not in any way questioning the validity of this singular treacherous transaction but what we are demanding from the Senator is to please kindly tell us where the boundaries of this illegal settlement are,” Kalu said in a Facebook post on Monday. “It would be in the interest of peaceful coexistence of all parties concerned was he, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu to, as a matter of urgency, publish the original survey plan of the size and dimension of the acreage he gave to his Fulani friends because the settlement continues to expand at an alarming rate to the detriment of surrounding villages.” Kanu lamented that families in the affected area are their ancestral lands to the Fulani, adding that all enquiries directed at the Abia State Ministry of Lands has gone unanswered. In a separate post, Kanu warned that his security outfit, the Eastern Security Network, ESN, is now out to deal with killer herdsmen in the region. “In less than two weeks #ESN will commence the full enforcement of Nigeria’s Anti-Grazing Law in the East. “The era of Biafrans crying and lamenting to EU and UN has come and gone. “The Dragon Flag has been raised! If you don’t know what it means go and ask. By the time what is about to happen is concluded, you will see Somalia as paradise on earth. “
