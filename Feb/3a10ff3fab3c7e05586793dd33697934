Maj. Gen. Samuel Adebayo, Nigeria’s new Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI) has assumed office. He took over leadership of the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) from Air Vice Marshal Muhammed Usman. The Deputy CDI, Maj. Gen. Gbolahan Oyefesobi acted for a few days after Usman’s retirement. On Friday, Oyefesobi handed over to Adebayo at the agency’s headquarters in Abuja. The CDI thanked God, President Muhammadu Buhari, and promised to build on the achievements of his predecessor. Adebayo noted that the DIA has raised the bar in intelligence statecraft. “I know that the task ahead is daunting but clearly achievable. I solicit your support and suggestions as we settle down to work”, he told personnel. Noting that leadership is about teamwork, transparency and integrity, the Army officer assured the DIA had the capacity to deliver its mandate to the Nigerian people. He said security agencies were doing their best but that more efforts were required. Adebayo disclosed that he would improve on technical capacity and prioritise core intelligence in support of ongoing operations and other engagements. The General pledged human capacity development with focus on staff specialisation for optimal output and enhancement of the agency’s specialist centres. Adebayo was a former director at the DIA and was Chief of Military Intelligence (CMI) at the Nigerian Army before his appointment.
