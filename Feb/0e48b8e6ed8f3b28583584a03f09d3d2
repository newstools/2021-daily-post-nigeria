Chelsea star, Mason Mount, has revealed why he took the penalty in his side’s 1-1 draw against Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday. Mount’s penalty and Takumi Minamino’s strike ensured both Chelsea and Southampton shared a point each at St Mary’s. Jorginho has been a regular penalty-taker for the Blues, but the Italy international was off the pitch, while Tammy Abraham, who was ahead of Mount in Chelsea’s queue of penalty-takers, was replaced at half-time. But Mount is now saying that he took the penalty during Chelsea’s clash with Southampton on manager, Thomas Tuchel’s advice. “Tammy was actually taking the first one but obviously he went off at half-time, so it was either me or Timo [Werner],” Mount told Chelsea’s official website. The manager said it should be whoever feels confident on the pitch, so I just stepped up. I missed my last one at Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, so I wanted to make it right,, and I was confident in scoring as well. “I’ve said before that it does mean a little bit more to me [to score against Southampton],, and I scored here last season as well, so it’s a nice ground for me to play at. “But the most important thing is to get the three points,, and we didn’t manage to do that,, so it’s obviously a disappointment.” Chelsea’s next match is against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday.
