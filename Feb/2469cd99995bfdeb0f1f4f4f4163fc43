Nigeria’s Defence Minister, Bashir Magashi, has advised citizens to defend themselves. The retired General told Nigerians to stay at alert at all times. Magashi addressed reporters on the banditry and attacks in some parts of the country. The minister said people should not be cowards, adding that bandits sometimes possess few rounds of ammunition. He said, “It is the responsibility of everybody to keep alert and to find safety when necessary. But we shouldn’t be cowards. “At times, the bandits will only come with about three rounds of ammunition, when they fire shots everybody runs. In our younger days, we stand to fight any aggression coming for us. “I don’t know why people are running from minor things like that. They should stand and let these people know that even the villagers have the competency and capabilities to defend themselves.” On firearms, he said even in developed countries, they are debating whether to continue or not. “But I don’t advise Nigeria to start issuing firearms for personal use”, Magashi said.
