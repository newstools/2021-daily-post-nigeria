Ebonyi Governor, David Umahi, on Wednesday said the people of South-East desire to join the All Progressive Congress (APC). Umahi noted that President Muhammadu Buhari had performed well in the region. He made the remark after a meeting with the APC Caretaker Chairman and Yobe Governor, Mai Mala Buni, on Wednesday. Umahi hailed the party for the ongoing membership registration and revalidation exercise. The governor disclosed that he complained to Buni about the number of forms allocated to Ebonyi. “The hundreds of forms at the polling units is a far cry from what we expected. Everybody in the South-East wants to belong to the APC. Mr. President has actually helped the South East so much. “In every of my broadcast or media chats, I always enumerated what Mr. President has done for our people. Ebonyi State is a shining example of the intervention by Mr. President. The narrative is changing. “When I went to Jigawa State and saw what they are doing like Yobe, Kebbi and other APC governors, I shouted that we are so much under-reported. Because the only way evil can thrive is for good men to keep quiet. “The South-East is very appreciative of the efforts of Mr. President in the development of the South-East. Everybody is interested in the APC membership registration, revalidation and update exercise. We want the Chairman of the party to take note of this. “He has assured me how he came about the shortage of forms. He has also assured me of the expectations of the national leadership of APC in terms of the number of Nigerians we are going to register”, Umahi said.
