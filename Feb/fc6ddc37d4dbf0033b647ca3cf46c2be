Mike Dean will be back to refereeing in the Premier League this weekend. Last weekend, Dean stood down from duties after receiving death threats online. He has now been appointed to take charge of Burnley vs West Brom at Turf Moor. The 52-year-old and his family received the threats on social media, after Dean had been involved in two controversial incidents. The referee showed a red card to West Hamâ€™s Tomas Soucek for catching Aleksandar Mitrovic with his elbow during a 0-0 draw at Fulham. Dean also sent off Southampton defender Jan Bednarek in the 9-0 defeat at Manchester United. Both of the decisions were later overturned following an appeal. Dean was however in charge of the FA Cup fifth-round tie between Leicester and Brighton last Wednesday.
