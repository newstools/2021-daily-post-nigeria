Former Real Madrid defender, Oscar Ruggeri, has urged Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, to leave Camp Nou immediately his contract expires this summer. Rugger, a fellow compatriot with Messi, alleged that Barcelona have mistreated the Argentine captain, adding that the Catalan club is not respected any more by opponents in Europe. According to him, Barcelona kicked Messi’s close friend, Luis Suarez, out of the club last summer. Speaking ahead of Barcelona’s La Liga clash with Cadiz on Sunday, Ruggeri told ESPN: “Messi has to leave the club [Barcelona]. “He’s still the best, but all the teams have lost respect for Barcelona. “It is over. He has to go, they did a lot of things to him, and we have come to this. “They kicked out [Luis Suarez] and forgot he’s [his] friend, [part of] the family. Suarez is a scorer. You can’t kick him out. Not many players are at Suarez’s level nowadays. “Now Messi wants to come to Argentina before it was the other way around. Now he would shoot [someone] to come to the national team before he escaped from it. He’s lost respect for Barcelona.”
