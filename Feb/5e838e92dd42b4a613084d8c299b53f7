Mr. Boss Mustapha, Chairman of Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, on Monday, disclosed that Nigeria had recorded a total of 13 of the B117 variant of COVID-19. At a briefing on COVID-19 in Abuja, Mustapha, who is also the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, said that six of them were detected in the last one week. He stated that all of them came out of samples collected from November to January. “The PTF, through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, is working with the Africa Centre for Disease Control on genomic surveillance. “The PTF wishes to report that shortage of oxygen for case management is gradually being overcome. “The private sector (Coalition Again COVID-19 (CACOVID) is supporting provision of oxygen nationwide, and allocations have been made to states.” Mustapha frowned at violation of COVID-19 prevention protocols. He urged passengers arriving in Nigeria to ensure compliance with international travel protocols and observe non-pharmaceutical intervention measures. Mustapha said: “The process for accessing vaccines and plans for getting it to the last mile is progressing. “The PTF wishes to appeal to all Nigerians, particularly the media, to recognise that humanity is at war with an unseen enemy. “Nations are also struggling to take positions to access the same commodity which is in obvious short supply. “We must, therefore, play our critical complementary roles of educating the public on the benefits of the vaccines in overcoming the pandemic.”NAN quoted him as saying.
