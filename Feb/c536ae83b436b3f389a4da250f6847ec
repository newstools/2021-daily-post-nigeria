The Imo State Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Ogubundu Nwadike has accused the State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma of desecrating the traditional institution by gradually converting the ‘Eze Imo palace’ to APC Secretariat. Nwadike laid the accusation through a release issued on Saturday. He said that the Government House and Eze Imo palace which were supposed to be mainly for Imo people, have been converted to rendezvous for APC functions by the Governor. The PDP scribe said that the Governor, in his ‘I don’t care attitude’, has hosted the Southeast APC stakeholders at the sacred palace during the flagging off of the party’s membership registration and revalidation exercise. The Government House, according to him, was also used for the hosting of an executive meeting of the party recently. This, he argued, has redefined those two places as ‘APC’ and ‘Eze APC palace, describing it as totally wrong and unacceptable by the people of Imo state. “There are even places like Dan Anyiam stadium, Heroes Square, Freedom Square, Imo Concorde Hotel and several others where APC get-together could be held. “Bringing such exclusive meetings to the government house and Eze Imo palace is pure desecration of the political and traditional emporiums of Imo people. “In fact, those places require cleansing and sanctification by a proven man of God for being contaminated. “Governor Hope Uzodinma should stop seeing Imo people as fools because we all know that he came through the back door”, he added.
