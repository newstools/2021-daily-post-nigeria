Southampton has made a special request to the Premier League, after falling foul of another refereeing decision, according to Radio Solent. Mike Dean took charge of their 9-0 hammering at Manchester United on Tuesday night. Dean showed a red card to Saints’ midfielder Alexandre Jankewitz after just two minutes. While there were no complaints about that incident, his handling of a penalty appeal later in the game has caused controversy. Dean pointed to the spot after Anthony Martial went down under close pressure from Saints’ defender Jan Bednarek. Even after consulting the VAR, the decision was upheld and Bednarek was given his marching orders. It is understood the club have now asked that neither Dean nor Lee Mason be appointed for any of their matches in the near future. Mason missed a clear penalty in Southampton’s match against Aston Villa on Saturday. A shot from Stuart Armstrong struck Villa defender Matty Cash on the arm on its way to a goal, but both Mason and the VAR – who happened to be Dean in that fixture – decided against awarding a spot-kick.
