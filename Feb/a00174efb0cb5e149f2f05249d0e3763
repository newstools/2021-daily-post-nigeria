Odion Ighalo scored his first goal for Saudi Arabian club, Al Shabab, during Saturdayâ€™s 4-0 win over Al Nassr. The 31-year-old who joined the club after his loan spell at Manchester United, failed to find the back of the net on his debut against Al Raed. However, he stroked the ball past goalkeeper Bradley Jones in the 90th minute, after replacing Fabio Martins. Ever Banega and Cristian Guanca (twice) had already put Shabab in control of the game with three goals. The result saw the White Lions extend their winning streak to four at the King Saud University Stadium. Moroccan forward Abderrazak Hamdallah was presented with a chance to reduce the deficit, but his penalty kick was saved by Zaid Al Bawardi. Al Shaba stay top of the Saudi Pro League table with 38 points from 18 outings so far in the 2020-21 campaign, four points clear of closest challengers Al Ahli.
