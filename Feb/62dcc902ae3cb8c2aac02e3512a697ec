The Federal Government has threatened to suspend flight operations from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and The Netherlands. The government gave the hint in reaction to new COVID-19 protocols the countries announced for incoming travellers. Director-General of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Musa Nuhu, spoke at the Presidential Task Force briefing on Monday in Abuja. Both countries recently requested that passengers from Nigeria must carry out a PCR test four hours before departing the country. “For us, passengers do the test 72 hours before departure and then the PCR test and the PTF recognises the rights of all countries to put in measures to protect their citizens just like Nigeria has done. “If they insist on having these additional tests being done, then PTF has decided that their operations will be suspended into Nigeria,” Nuhu said. The NCAA boss noted that UAE, Netherlands, other countries or airlines would not determine for Nigeria, who to approve or how these test would be done.
