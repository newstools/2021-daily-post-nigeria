Two persons lost their lives in a fatal accident, which occurred on at a village between Kafin Madaki and Ningi on the Ningi-Bauchi road on Thursday in which several others were seriously injured. DAILY POST learnt that the accident occurred when a commercial bus hit a motorcycle rider. A villager, who simply identified himself as Adamu, informed journalists in Bauchi that the bus driver, who was said to be coming from opposite direction on top speed, hit the motorcycle rider while he was trying to cross the road. According to him, as much as the bus driver tried not to hit the motorcyclist, he could not avoid hitting him in his bid to save the lives of the people in the bus. Adamu informed that the motorcyclist died on the spot, while his passenger gave up on the way to Kafin Madaki General Hospital. Those who sustained injuries in the accident, according to him, were rushed to the same hospital, where they are currently receiving treatment. When contacted, the Public Relations Officer (PRO), Bauchi Sector of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Rilwan Suleiman, confirmed the accident but declined to give further details. According to him, “I heard about that (accident) but I cannot give you details. Let me confirm and get back to you.” As at the time of filing this report, the PRO was yet to call back.
