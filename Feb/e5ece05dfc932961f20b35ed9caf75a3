The abducted students of Government Science College, Kagara, in Niger State, have been released. Their relatives and staff also taken are now out of captivity. They all regained freedom Saturday morning. It is unclear if ransom was paid for their release. DAILY POST gathered that the victims would be taken to the Government House in Minna. The bandits had threatened to hold them as long as they wished if the government failed to meet their demands. The bandits, dressed in military uniforms, stormed the school last week. They seized 27 students, 12 relatives and 3 staff members. On Friday, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) had condemned recent abductions. The opposition lamented the latest incident at the Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe in Zamfara State. PDP said kidnapping by bandits had become a making-making venture under President Muhammadu Buhari administration. Kola Ologbondiyan, the spokesman, in a statement, said the party earlier alerted of a link between the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the outlaws. “It is unpardonable that the APC has failed to rein in their bandits, who they brought from neighboring countries to help them to muscle the 2019 election.” Ologbondiyan said instead, APC allowed them to continue to invade communities and wreak havoc on Nigerians. The party noted that acts of terrorism validates concerns that the ruling APC and its administration have become bereft of solutions. The PDP said kidnapping of school children and other vulnerable people for ransom turned lucrative due to “the lethargic approach and compromises under the Buhari administration”. The party told President Buhari to step out of the Aso Rock presidential villa and ensure the immediate rescue of more than 300 schoolgirls abducted.
