The Theatre Commander (TC) of Operation Lafiya Dole (OPLD), Major General Faruk Yahaya, has charged Nigerian troops to sustain the military offensive against Boko Haram. The TC’s encouragement followed the elimination of the sect’s commanders and fighters. Since Operation Tura Takai Bango commenced in January, more than 50 terrorists have been killed. During his operational tour of formations on Friday, Yahaya hailed soldiers for their victories in Bama axis, Pulka, deep into Boko Haram and ISWAP camps. He was accompanied by the Theatre Logistics Component Commander, Major General P. I. Eze; Commander 37 Artillery Brigade, Brigadier General M. Bashir; Colonel G. E. Archibong and other senior officers. The General urged troops to remain courageous and more determined to clear the remnant terrorists in the general area of Sambisa forest. “You must imbibe the right attitude as professional soldiers, you must not give room for laxity and assumptions. When you see the terrorists, deal decisively with them. Pursue them, don’t spare their lives”, he said. Yahaya also commended the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) involved in some of the operations. The TC was received and briefed by the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 7 Division, Major General Abdul Khalifa Ibrahim. Ibrahim assured that troops were in high spirits to sustain the war against insurgency. Yahaya also visited the Shehu of Bama, Umar Kyari Umar El-Kanemi in appreciation of his support and cooperation of the emirate.
