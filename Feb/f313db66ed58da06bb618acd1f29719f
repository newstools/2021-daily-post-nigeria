Pastor Tunde Bakare, the Serving Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church in Lagos, has declared that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration has not met Nigerians’ expectations. Bakare explained that there is a general feeling of disappointment among Nigerians who expected change under the Buhari government after rejecting the PDP and embracing the APC’s change. He said it appears the citizens have been shortchanged. The outspoken cleric stated this on Tuesday night, during an Instagram Live session with media mogul, Dele Momodu. “We are praying hard that the country will survive and become strong again, this is not what we all call the Nigeria of our dreams,” Bakare said. “Nigeria will survive and will become the Nigeria of our dreams, but right now, things are not together, especially with the drum of disintegration, which is louder than before. “Nigeria is better together. If we go back together to the basics of how we came together, looking at 1960 and 1963, we can still be together. We are not there yet, but we are getting closer. “The truth of the matter is it is still the same Buhari, in the midst of many competing interests, we respond differently. The President is still himself. Some have even asked me if he is not somebody else. “Power changes people, has power changed him or is he making the best situation of the circumstances? He will be the one to answer it. “The expectations of Nigerians, including everyone who woke up to say we need a breath of fresh air, has not been met. There is a feeling of disappointment. “Citizens have the right to demand for good governance. People deserve the government they get.” He added: “We rejected PDP and embraced APC’s change, but it appears we have been shortchanged.”
