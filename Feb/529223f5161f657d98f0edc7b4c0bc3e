Doyin Okupe, a former aide to ex-Presidents, Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan, has declared that he will be joining the race for the presidency in 2023 if the security situation in the country lingers on. “I will run for President in 2023 if banditry, kidnapping, herdsmen ravaging the South West and Boko Haram, all continue unabated,” he tweeted. According to him, bandits terrorising the country will be stopped dead on their tracks. The politician noted that the situation where bandits operate unchallenged for 3 to 4 hrs will no longer be possible during his government, adding that any major mass movement in the forests will be detected by satellite and ground forces will be mobilised instantly. “I will also submit a post dated letter of resignation from office by myself and the vice president to NASS. It will be dated 30th September 2025,” he continues “It shall be activated by a vote of 2/3 majority of the joint seating of the NASS, who would have satisfied themselves with the fact that my admin has not done enough or anything vividly substantial in the war against the above listed 4 scourges that have plagued this Nation. “I say all this with great and profound sense of responsibility considering the gloom and perplexity that these menaces have brought on our Nation while we all appear helpless and hopeless and we have a raging internal war pervading dear of insecurity and lack of safety, severe inter ethnic hatred and strife tending to tear the nation apart. “I sincerely believe that things do not need to be the way they are.

I am convinced within myself that I have the knowledge, the intellect, the exposure and experience that will be required to lead this nation out of its present predicament , if no other seriously minded person is willing to offer themselves. “As a teaser I will elaborate briefly but not in too much detail on what the government can do to curtail this rampaging menace. “As President I will declare a state of emergency in the affected states. I know politicians will not like this. But without security the nation and its politics will neither survive nor exist. “Governors will not leave their political offices but their duties and functions shall be strictly limited to administrative matters while the state of emergency is in place.

People do not have to agree with what I have proposed. “If I am the Nigerian President this will be my brief to my security council. They will give their input and we will swing to action.”
