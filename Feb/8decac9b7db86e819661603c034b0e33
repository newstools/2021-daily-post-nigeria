The Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore has alleged that Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State created Amotekun to kill the Fulani and Northerners residing in the Southwest. Saleh Alhassan, the National Secretary of the group made the allegation in a statement he signed. Alhassan warned that Akeredolu would be held responsible for anything that happens to Northerners and herders residing in the Southwest. The statement reads partly: “Akeredolu created an ethnic militia (Amotekun) that is now unleashing terror and mayhem on innocent herders and northerners living in the south-west against unconstitutional and blanket eviction notices for herders to vacate places where they earn their livelihoods. “Akeredolu will be held accountable for the ongoing genocide against innocent pastoralist and northerners living in the south- west.” Alhassan also accused the governor of being “the brain behind the creation of ‘Amotekun’ allegedly unleashing terror on herders and Northerners in the Southwestern states of Ondo and Oyo.” Meanwhile, Akeredolu had said any cattle found along the streets of Akure the state capital would be arrested. The governor gave the directive while insisting on ban of open grazing in the State. Following alleged criminal activities of suspected herdsmen in the Southwest, some youths of the region had vowed to chase herders out of the Southwest. Popular Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho had issued a seven-day ultimatum to the Fulani community in Igangan, a town in Ibarapa Local Government Area of Oyo State to vacate the area. He attempted to carry out his to evict the Fulani in the area when he gathered hundreds of his supporters, stormed the community and confronted the Seriki Fulani.
