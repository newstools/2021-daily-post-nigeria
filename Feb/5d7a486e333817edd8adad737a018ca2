Afenifere, Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) and other Yoruba groups have warned President Muhammadu Buhari to stop the country from attaining full-blown anarchy. They met on Friday under the aegis of Southwest Security Stakeholders Group (SSSG). Agbekoya, Egbe Isokan Oodua, Egbe Olode Ibarapa, vigilance groups, hunters and prominent individuals attended the meeting. Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, the convener, urged stakeholders in the the Southwest to collaborate to tackle security challenges in the region. Adams said insecurity was a matter of life and death, adding that all hands must be on deck to strategically address the nationwide tension. In a communiqué, the organisations expressed concern about violence in different parts of the country. “The Defence Minister’s advice to Nigerians to defend themselves was clearly official endorsement of self-defence”, it read. “We are worried that the situation, if not addressed, signals a grievous national crisis. We call on the government to quickly arrest the apparent descent into anarchy. “President Muhammadu Buhari should prove his innocence in the carnage being perpetrated by herders by not only unambiguously condemning the nefarious acts but also take clear steps to exterminate it.” Afenifere Publicity Secretary, Yinka Odumakin, said the meeting had the endorsement of Reuben Fasoranti, Ayo Adebanjo and other Yoruba leaders. He added that the Yoruba nation would not fold its arms and allow the killer herdsmen to send prominent sons and daughters to early graves. Odumakin faulted the current political structure, noting that a multinational setting like Nigeria must be built on respect for different human components. The parley reiterated its support for the Southwest security network codenamed Amotekun. A strategic committee was inaugurated. Members are Yinka Odumakin, Olumuyiwa Okunowo, Sola Lawal, Gboyega Adejumo, Diran Bangbopa, Yinka Oguntimehin, James Udoma, Akin Osuntokun and Babajide Tanimowo.
