Thomas Tuchel has named his captains at Chelsea. The German says he is pleased to have Cesar Azpilicueta, Thiago Silva, Jorginho, and Ngolo Kante as Chelsea captains. He also compared Azpilicueta with former Blues captains John Terry and Frank Lampard. Azpilicueta who fell in the pecking order during Lampard’s reign as manager, has seen himself back playing regularly under the new manager. The 31-year-old Spaniard is one of several Chelsea players who have featured in each of the five Premier League games under Tuchel so far. “I strongly believe in the power of captains in football teams,” Tuchel told Chelsea TV. “I had the pleasure to have Thiago Silva as my captain in Paris, together with Marquinhos, and now I have Azpi, Thiago, Jorginho and [N’Golo] Kante [at Chelsea]. “You cannot wish for more. “When I watch Chelsea on TV, like Frank Lampard, like John Terry, Azpi was the guy that makes total sense that he plays in blue and is the captain — it’s logic.”
