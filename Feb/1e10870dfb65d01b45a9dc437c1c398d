President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the death of Chief Chibuzo Nduwueze Ziggy Azike. The late member of the Body of Benchers was his close political associate. In a statement by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, Buhari recalled that Azike contested for a seat in the Senate in 1999 on the platform of the All Peoples Party (APP). He also contested for the governorship of Imo State under the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) in 2007. Buhari described the death as a “painful loss,” adding that “the nation has really lost a patriotic citizen.” He prayed that the Almighty will repose the soul of the deceased and grant the bereaved family and friends the fortitude to bear the loss. Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, will represent Buhari at Azike’s funeral on Friday. The burial will be held at St. Michael’s Anglican Church, Okohia, Isiala Mbano in Imo State.
