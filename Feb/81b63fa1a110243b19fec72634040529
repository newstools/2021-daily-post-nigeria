Former Liverpool defender, Dejan Lovren, on Thursday, backed forward Mohamed Salah to remain at Anfield despite rumours linking him with a move away from the Premier League champions. Recall that Bayern Munich CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, had said earlier this week that it would be “an honour” if Salah joined the Bundesliga champions. Salah had since hinted at a desire to play for either Real Madrid or Barcelona in the future. However, Lovren, who remains close friends with Salah, feels the Egyptian international could even see out his career with Jurgen Klopp’s side. “I’m still in communication with Mo Salah,” the Zenit Saint Petersburg defender told talkSPORT. “We are still the best buddies, even outside football, and we talk about everything. “Individually, when you look at the amount of goals he’s scored, he’s doing amazingly at the moment. “Mo is in the best age of his football career at 28. “Maybe he looks a bit older, but he’s in the peak of his form so why not stay another four, five, six years?”
