The immediate past Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshall Sadique Abubakar on Tuesday said he was leaving the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fulfilled. Sadique made the assertion during a Fly Out parade organized for his exit by the Nigerian Air Force at NAF Base in Abuja. Sadique who acknowledged God for his help while in service, said in the last five years, the Nigerian Air Force, has been repositioned and restructured into a highly “professional and disciplined force.” He expressed optimism that with the 15 aircraft and eight unmanned combat aerial vehicles provided recently, NAF would be able to address the current security challenges in the country. Sadique also expressed confidence that the current Chief of the Air Staff, Air-Vice Marshal I.O Amao would deliver on his job. “As I exit the Nigerian Air Force, I am leaving the service fulfilled because I have substantially achieved what I set out to achieve. I want to thank all my family members especially my aged mother for their support, prayers and understanding.” DAILY POST recalls that President Muhammadu Buhari, last week, approved the resignation of the nation’s Service Chiefs including Chief of Defence Staff, General Abayomi Olonisakin; Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen. Tukur Buratai; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok Ekwe Ibas; and Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar.
