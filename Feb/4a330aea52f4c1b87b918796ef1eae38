Former Nigeria Military Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, has cautioned state governors to watch their words when making statements on the growing crisis involving herdsmen in parts of the country. Abubakar, who is also the Chairman of the National Peace Committee advised governors to make sure there is law and order in their states. The former head of state in his comments forbade Nigeria to go back to 1960 when the country had problems that resulted in a civil war. Recall that herdsmen have continued to be bolder in their attacks on Nigerians from different parts of the country, especially the South-West, where there is growing apprehension over continued attack on innocent people, majorly in rural communities. However, Abubakar, while appearing on Arise Television’s Morning Show, said, “The governors have found themselves in a difficult situation. It is their responsibility to guard their states regardless of who and who is in their states. “Ethnic disharmony is rearing itself all over the place. You could see where the herders are being chased from some of the parts of the Southern states and their cattle are being killed. Certainly, there is heightened tension in the country. “Some people are also migrating from one part of the country back to their states where they feel safer. God forbid this is taking us back to 1960, where we had a problem that resulted in a civil war. “That’s why I and the peace committee are calling for caution so that we do not go back to that road.” He added, “They (Governors) must make sure there is law and order in their states, and they should watch their utterances because what they say, people will take it as an order. “They as governors should be aware of what they say; they shouldn’t say anything that’ll be misread that they’re fighting people who are not of their state origin.”
