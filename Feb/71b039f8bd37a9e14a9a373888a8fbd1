The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged the United States and other countries to prevail on President Muhammadu Buhari to take decisive steps to protect Nigerians. PDP expressed concern over escalated violence, terrorism and banditry ravaging the country. National Chairman, Uche Secondus, spoke at a meeting with the Political Officer at the United States Embassy in Nigeria, Jerry Howard. The chairman accused the Buhari administration of failing to demonstrate the capacity to protect the citizens. Secondus disclosed PDP’s plan to organise a non-partisan national conference on security. “Everyday, our nation is confronted with reports of gruesome killings, kidnapping and unrestrained destruction across all parts of our country. As a party and patriotic citizens, we can no longer continue to watch”, he said. The opposition leader expressed anxiety over an impending food crisis in Nigeria due to insecurity. Secondus advised Buhari to respond to calls for credible elections by making personal commitment towards accelerated amendment to the Electoral Act. In his remarks, Howard assured of the continued support of the United States towards the deepening of Nigeria’s democracy.
