Manchester City striker, Sergio Aguero, has admitted he does not know if he will stay at the club beyond this summer. The 32-year-old’s current deal expires at the end of the 2020/2021 season. Aguero has become a legend at City since he moved from Atletico Madrid in 2011. He has gone on to become the club’s record goalscorer, winning the Premier League title four times. Aguero was asked about his plans in an interview with YouTuber Inai Lanos and replied: “I finish my contract at the end of the season and I don’t know what to do yet. “The first thing I want to do is play and at the end of the season we will see.” Aguero is back from injury and is set to feature against Arsenal on Sunday, as Pep Guardiola’s men continue to tighten their grip on the top spot.
