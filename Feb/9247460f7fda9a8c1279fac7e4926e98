A member of House of Representatives from Oyo State, Tolulope Akande-Sadipe has said that the All Progressives Congress (APC) has learnt its lesson. Akande-Sadipe, who spoke with journalists on Thursday, stated that the party had learnt its lesson after it failed to win the gubernatorial election in 2019. DAILY POST reports that APC lost the gubernatorial election to Governor Seyi Makinde who contested on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Akande-Sadipe, however, noted that the party is back on its track to dislodge Makinde in 2023. Akande-Sadipe, who represents Oluyole federal constituency, noted that the party had learnt its lesson after its failed attempt to win the gubernatorial election in 2019. She noted that the party was poised to take back Oyo State, to restore the development legacy of the immediate past Governor, Ajimobi Ajimobi who died last year. Akande-Sadipe added that she was proud of the reconciliation among their party members in Oyo State. She said “The renewed, re-energized APC for the change Oyo needs is here, yesterday was a day of pride for our dear party. “We are on track to change the narrative, we have learnt from the lessons of the past. “We are builders. We will continue the development of the modern Oyo state spearheaded by our leader Late Senator Abiola Ajimobi. “We women of APC would play our part in this registration drive, hold our own and prove our worth to the party. “The party in turn should take note and ensure that a better male to female ratio is achieved. 50/50 would be nice but 60/40 in 2023 will do.”
