Andrea Pirlo has blamed his inexperienced players for their 1-1 draw against Hallas Verona in their Serie A game on Saturday. Juventus missed the opportunity to close the gap and mount pressure on Inter and AC Milan who take each other later today. Pirlo said after the game that his side lacked the experience required to close out the game with Verona. Addressing the press after the disappointing draw, Pirlo said that Juve are in an “emergency situation” when asked if they are too reliant on Cristiano Ronaldo for goals. Ronaldo netted his 19th goal of the Serie A season to fire Juve ahead, but the Old Lady were pegged back by an Antonin Barak header in a 1-1 draw on Saturday. The draw leaves Juve seven points adrift of leaders Inter, and Pirlo pointed to a lack of experience in his side. “It’s disappointing, as we knew it would be a difficult and hard-fought game,” Pirlo told DAZN. “We managed to take the lead, which was the most difficult part, then didn’t keep hold of it. “There are these small details that unfortunately young players don’t understand can make the difference and lead to points. “When you are in front, you must try to bring these games home. We were missing a lot of experienced players, so the younger elements didn’t understand the way the match was going. “I asked Cristiano and Alex Sandro to speak to them and make their voices heard, but it wasn’t enough.”
