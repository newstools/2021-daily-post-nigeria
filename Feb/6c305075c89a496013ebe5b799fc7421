An Abuja based cleric has cautioned Christians and non-christian comedians to refrain from using Christianity or any other religion for entertainment. Sarah Omakwu, Senior Pastor of Family Worship Centre (FWC) in Abuja, gave the caution on Sunday. Omakwu noted that part of loving God is to defend the gospel of Jesus Christ and all He represents. The Pastor said making jokes about Christianity is provoking and a mockery to God and to those who believe in God, in Jesus and in Christianity. “Comedians should stop throwing jokes about the word of God, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Communion, anointing oil, deliverance and powers. “Christian comedians, especially, ought to be telling the world about God and not making Christianity look like a joke to those whom they ought to be evangelising to.” The cleric also warned against posting ‘silly’ comedy about the gospel of Christ and about pastors and men of God. “If other religions do not joke about their religion, why should Christians joke about theirs. If comedians must tell jokes, they should use the things of the world to entertain the world”, she added.
