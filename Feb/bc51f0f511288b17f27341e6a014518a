Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) government of playing game with Nigerians in the fight against insecurity in the country. He alleged that competence and genuine efforts at fighting criminality and insecurity in the country are often undermined by political inference in the posting of Commissioners of Police. The governor made the accusation when he led the Chief Whip of the Nigeria Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, former Minister of Works, Mike Onolememen and other dignitaries on project inspection tour in Port Harcourt and Obio-Akpor Local Government Areas of Rivers State on Thursday. Governor Wike said it is very disappointing that the Inspector General of Police (IG) will compromise competence in posting a Commissioner of Police (CP) to Rivers State because a favour seeking politician had approached him for such patronage. According to the governor, such handling of touchy issues like insecurity makes it difficult for him to partner with the Federal Government often, especially because they are not committed to solving the insecurity plaguing the country. Otherwise, he stated, why should the Inspector General of Police grant such demand of posting a CP to compromise competence. “There is so much insecurity in Nigeria. There are killings everywhere and they (APC) told Nigerians that they will solve the problem. But the problem is not being solved. “They appoint a Commissioner of Police (CP) based on patronage. A politician from my state will go to see the Inspector General of Police and ask him to give him a CP. “And the IG will not post CP based on competence to fight crime but based on the fact that the man in the party says he wants so and so person. “When the person comes, will he fight insecurity? No. That’s the problem we have in this country today. How can I partner with such a government. A government that will not do things based on competence”, he said.
