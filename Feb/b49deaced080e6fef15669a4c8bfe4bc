Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has praised Nicolas Pepe for his current patch of form but has warned him that consistency will ensure he keeps his place in the team. Pepe has blown hot and cold since his £72million from Lille 18 months ago. The Ivorian has played mostly on the right-wing, but the 25-year-old scored for the third successive away Premier League game during Tuesday’s defeat against Wolves playing from the left. It is a position that captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has made his own during Arteta’s time at the club. With Aubameyang back in the squad after his mother’s illness, Arteta now has a big decision to make ahead of the Aston Villa game on Saturday. On whether Aubameyang would replace Pepe at the weekend, Arteta told a media conference: “At the end of the day, we have to play the players who are in the best form and everybody has to earn the right to play and participate in the games. “That’s what everybody’s doing, pushing each other to raise the level. You can see that the level has been raised because everybody is playing at their best. There’s still room for improvement so everybody has to keep pushing.”
