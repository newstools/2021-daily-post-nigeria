He said: “I have been agitating in the last five years that it is time to end open grazing in Nigeria to put an end to the herders crisis that has now snowballed into a major threat to national security. “By the grace of God we will get there and we will all be happier for it. And like I said at the time, our agitation for ranching will one day be celebrated like we did June 12 because it is the best global practice to enthrone peace in our dear country. “As far as I am doing the right thing to save our country, I owe no one an apology particularly those in positions of authority who would rather choose to remain silent and watch our country head towards anarchy. “We will continue to do the right things as far as my people are with me and majority of Nigerians know that I stand for the truth and nothing more in order to save our country.”
