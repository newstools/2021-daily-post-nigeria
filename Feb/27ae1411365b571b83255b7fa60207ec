Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said their 20 straight wins in all competitions, may be the best thing they have ever achieved. Ruben Dias and John Stones scored either side of a Michail Antonio finish to give City a 2-1 victory over West Ham yesterday. It was their 14th in a row in the league and leaves them 13 points clear at the top of the table, having played a game more than Leicester and Manchester United. But having been written off for the title in early December, Guardiola’s side have been devastating since. “In this period, in this era, with this situation, to be able to do 20, maybe it is one of the greatest achievements we have done in our careers, for sure. “That doesn’t mean a title win, of course, but this period in time, the toughest period in England, the winter time, [to have] no one week of rest for three or four months, every three days a game, with the COVID-19 situation, injury situations. To be on this kind of run – winning, winning, winning – means mental strength,” Guardiola said.
