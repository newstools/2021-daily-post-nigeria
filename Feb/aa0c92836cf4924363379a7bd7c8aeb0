Governor Yahaya Bello on Wednesday confirmed that Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has joined the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. Recall that Fani- Kayode had said he had a fruitful discussion on how to move Nigeria forward during his meeting with Bello over the weekend Although he did not debunk reports that he had defected, Bello while addressing members of the party on Wednesday said Fani-Kayode joined the party in good faith to add his positive energy. According to him, Fani-Kayode who was a founding member of the party left due to misunderstanding and has now seen the light. He said, ”I have the mandate to sanitize, mobilize and educate and woo Nigerians into the party, irrespective of their background. ”Our Brother Chief Femi Fani-Kayode has joined our party in good faith. He is joining our party to add his own positive energy and make a contribution to ensure that APC is a party to beat. ”Remember that Fani-Kayode was a foundation member of this great party but due to misunderstanding, he decided to port elsewhere. Now he has decided to join our party. He approached me and by the mandate given to me by the party, I must not segregate or discriminate against any individual even if he has a different opinion about the governing party before and he has seen the light, the reality and the need to join the All Progressives Party. ”It is just nice, important and very sweet to accommodate and welcome Fani-Kayode to join the party. Remember that this party does not belong to one individual, it belongs to all Nigerians. ”You are free to join if you feel otherwise and you cannot understand what is happening before and now you understand and want to join we will welcome you with our arms wide open. So Chief Femi Fani Kayode you are welcome to our party, come and make your own contribution.”
