Nigerian Rapper CDQ has accused organisers of the 14th Headies award of “playing politics’ with the choice of winners. CDQ said this on his Twitter page after Mayorkun won the Best Street Hop artiste category at the event on Sunday night. Mayorkun defeated Naira Marley, Rudeboy, Zlatan, Reminisce to clinch the award in that category. According to the rapper, Naira Marley deserved to win that category. CDQ attributed Mayorkun’s win to industry politics. His tweet read: “Headies you have started this obvious industry politics things again. How the hell una go carry Best Street Hop give someone else at the expense of Naira this year and conscience no judge una? “Everyone in that category na family but ooto oro o ni ka ma so ohun (We should speak the truth).”
