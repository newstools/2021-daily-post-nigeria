Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has ruled Ilkay Gundogan out of their Premier League match at Everton on Wednesday. Gundogan has been in fine form for the leader, with 10 goals in as many fixtures games. The midfielder picked up a groin problem during Saturday’s 3-0 win over Tottenham. Kevin De Bruyne has resumed training with City, while Sergio Aguero, who tested positive for Coronavirus during his recovery from a knee injury, will be on the bench at Goodison Park, as he was at the weekend. “Ilkay is much better, but I don’t think he’s available tomorrow. “Kevin is getting better; he was training with the all of the group and feeling much better. “Sergio has been one year injured; he can’t start from the beginning. But he is ready to come back, and he’ll be on the bench again,” Guardiola said.
