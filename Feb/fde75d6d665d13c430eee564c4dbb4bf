Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has predicted that Chelsea will finish outside of the Premier League top four this season under their manager, Thomas Tuchel. Chelsea currently sits in the fifth position on the Premier League table with 39 points from 23 games, but Ferdinand believes Tuchel’s side will not qualify for next season’s Champions League, adding that Leicester will finish ahead of the Blues. Last season, Chelsea finished in fourth position ahead of Leicester City, have kept their place in the top four so far this season. “I think there is a bit to much to do maybe,” Ferdinand told BT Sport at the weekend when asked about Chelsea’s top four chances. “Leicester are still a fairly consistent team and I think the other teams will just be able to stay ahead of them. “I think Tuchel will get it right there, I do like him as a manager. I think the players have taken to him immediately but I think there will be a little bit to do maybe to get in there. “I would not be surprised if they did, but that is what I have gone for. I think the remit is 100% Champions League football at a minimum once he’s gone in there. We will have to see with the way that regime is run he could get the sack. “I think Frank’s [Lampard] sitting at home saying I could have got that team in the top four.”
