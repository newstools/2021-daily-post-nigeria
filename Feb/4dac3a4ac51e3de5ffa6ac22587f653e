The Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) said over 60 percent of teachers in Nigeria’s public primary schools lack digital literacy to participate effectively in any e-learning environment. Executive Secretary UBEC, Dr Hamid Bobboyi disclosed this at the commissioning ceremony of basic education projects at the Federal University Dutse, in Jigawa State. He said this was discovered during the Covid-19 lockdown of 2020. Boboyi explained that as part of the commission’s effort of ensuring development of basic education in Nigeria, digital literacy is another area the commission focused on. He said the commission is building seven zonal and state model schools to actualize its vision of a robust digital basic education in Nigeria. “Nigeria is building seven zonal and state model schools which are purely digital with state of the art facilities for e-learning. “Digital resource center is also being constructed in Abuja to coordinate digital learning in the basic education sub-sector,” he said. He said when completed, it would put the sub-sector on the digital map of the world. He commended the outgoing vice Chancellor of the Federal University Dutse, for all achievements in the last five years of her tenure.
