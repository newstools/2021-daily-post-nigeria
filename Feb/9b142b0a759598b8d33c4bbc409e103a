Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) is again trending in the news over a sex tape. It is still unclear if any of the individuals in the viral video is a lecturer or student of the school. However, in the video, a man alleged to be a lecturer of the institution was having sex with a lady said to be a student of LAUTECH. In the 44-seconds video, the lecturer was left in shock after he turned during the sex romp with the lady and saw someone filming him. The Management of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology LAUTECH, is yet to react to this, but the news has generated reactions from Nigerians. Recall that few weeks ago, a sex tape emerged online involving three individuals linked to LAUTECH. The management at the time in a statement, denied claims that the female participant is one of its students. ”We do not have anything to do with the lady you mentioned in the video.There are so many of them who did not even complete secondary school education but would go on social media to claim they are LAUTECH students. “We don’t know her. LAUTECH is a school for only serious-minded students and staff and not her type,” it had said. However, they are yet to confirm if the man in the recent video is a lecturer of LAUTECH.
