The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) asked President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to settle their “mercenaries”. The PDP gave the advice to reaction to bandits’ kidnap of staff and students of Government Secondary School, Kagara in Niger State. The spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement on Wednesday, lamented that while Nigerians were under attack, the APC was carrying out membership registration and revalidation exercise. PDP said the stance of the APC administration towards the fight against banditry further validates reports that the bandits are enjoying cover under the ruling party. The opposition said it explains why the APC never raised a strong voice against what has become a national calamity. Ologbondiyan noted that instead, APC leaders are patronizing the bandits and making excuses for them. “The public space is awash with reports that many of these bandits terrorizing Nigerians were political mercenaries brought in by the APC from neighboring countries to help it enforce the rigging of the 2019 elections, but which the APC and its leaders failed to settle after the elections, leaving them to unleash their frustrations on innocent Nigerians. “Our party charges the APC to speak out on these reports and take immediate steps to settle their political mercenaries, return them to wherever they brought them from and bring an end to these gruesome attacks on Nigerians.” While commiserating with the victims of the Niger attacks, the PDP urged the security forces to go after the bandits and rescue the Kagara school children before any harm comes upon them.
