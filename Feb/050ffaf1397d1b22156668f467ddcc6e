American rapper, Kanye West, has given an idea as to why his marriage to reality TV star, Kim-Kardashian crashed. Recall that Kim Kardashian on Friday filed divorce proceedings against Kanye West after seven years of marriage. DAILY POST reports that their marriage hit the rocks in 2020 while Kanye West was campaigning for the US presidency. Also, Kanye in a Twitter thread called out the Kardashian and Jenner family as he described his life living with the Kardashian’s similar to that of the ‘Get out’ movie. However, People’s Magazine on Saturday revealed that a family source who spoke to newsmen said Kanye has been “texting people” and “talking things through. According to the source, the American rapper is in that place of ‘if only. “He is currently in a place of “If only I had done this if only I hadn’t done that.’ “He equally thinks that the Presidential run was the straw that broke the camel’s back. “Before that, there was hope. After that, all hope was gone. He thinks his involvement in politics cost him his marriage because Kim had opposed the idea from the beginning. “He knew it was coming but that doesn’t make it any easier. “This is a sombre day for him.” “Kanye is very aware that she has been a good wife. He still loves her very much. But he understands,” “The couple are “being adults” about the split and Kanye is currently seeing counsellors and advisors to help him through this spot,” the source said.
