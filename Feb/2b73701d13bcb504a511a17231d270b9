A Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the former National Publicity Secretary of the defunct New Peoples Democratic Party (nPDP), Chukwuemeka Eze have condemned the alleged smear campaign and blackmail by the Prince Uche Secondus-led Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, against Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi. Eze, in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Tuesday, said it is widely obvious that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party in Ebonyi State is still reeling from the pains inflicted on them by the cogent exit of Governor Umahi from their fold. He admonished the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party, PDP, to employ modesty and be constructive in their approach to issues by steadily conducting proper assessments ahead of any media engagement. Eze tasked the party to shelve its alleged self-serving and crafty scheme of misleading the reading public with malicious myths that only distorts and misshapes facts and history. He stressed that the role of the opposition requires an appreciable degree of tact, skill and sensitive mental perception and not their spiteful tantrums that contradict the minutest locally recognized standard of civilized behaviour, ethics and decorum. The APC chieftain reminded the PDP that the overwhelming endorsement and love showered on Umahi by the people of Ebonyi State and which resulted in his electoral victory especially during the 2019 election was as a result of the general assessment of the socio-economic drive, legendary achievements and sound policies of governor. The former PDP national spokesman appealed to Governor Umahi never to give in to the antics of opposition elements who are poised to smear his track records with their venomous and hostile bushwhacks. Eze called on Ebonyians to continue to show maximum support to the Governor in his desire to turn the once backward state into the development haven and investment hub of the African region.
