Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said it will be “difficult” for Kieran Tierney and Bukayo Saka to face Wolves on Tuesday night. However, Arteta expects Alexandre Lacazette to play. Tierney (calf) and Saka (hip) both missed the 0-0 draw with Manchester United on Saturday. But it was hoped they would return for the midweek trip to Molineux. “They haven’t been able to train yet with us, so I think it will be really difficult for them,” Arteta said. “I don’t know, we are going to try until the last minute – see how they are feeling.” One player who should be available, however, is Lacazette. The Arsenal forward had to go to hospital after Saturday’s game, having suffered a heavy landing in the closing stages following a challenge with Harry Maguire. “We have to follow the protocols,” Arteta said, when asked why Lacazette went to hospital. “We have to test him and take an x-ray. He was completely fine after the game, he was fine yesterday [Sunday] and he has slept well, so I expect him to be available.”
