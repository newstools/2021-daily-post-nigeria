Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai , has renewed calls for state police as security situation worsens in the country. El-Rufai, one of the speakers at a programme called ‘Radio Now’s Urgent Conversation’ on Channels TV on Friday, said the nations’ state proves that centralised police has not worked. “Give us state police, vest all minerals in the state, and decentralised our judiciary now, not tomorrow, not later. “Banditry is a national problem, with victims from all parts of Nigeria, and we should address it with a common resolve.” The governor noted that Nigerians live in fear of their lives and the country in one of its most difficult times. “It is an understatement to say that Nigeria is in one of its most difficult moments. The genuine fears for their lives and properties are felt by many citizens across the country need to be assuaged.” The governor urged all responsible persons to show compassion to those affected by the situation. The governor also called for devolution of power between the Federal Government and all states in the country. “I will dwell on three of the issues that I believe are critical to the immediate needs for Nigeria to pull back from the brink. “The first, it is imperative for Federal, state, and community policing. We do not have enough police. One centralised police for the country just has not worked,” El-Rufai said. El-Rufai also called for the amendment of the constitution for the state to control resources and a less unitary judiciary. “Secondly, the constitution must be amended and relevant laws to ensure control of oil and gas, mines, and minerals in the states that already have control over land under the land use Act with royalties and taxes payable to the Federal Government and the Federation Account “Number three, we must rectify the anomaly of a Federation that has a more or less unitary judiciary,” the governor added.
