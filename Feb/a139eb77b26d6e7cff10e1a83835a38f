The Governor Dapo Abiodun-led government in Ogun State has ordered the arrest of operatives of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), DAILY POST reports. Government told the Ogun State chapter of the NURTW and its operatives to stay away from all parks and garages in the state to avoid incurring the full wrath of the law. In a statement issued in Abeokuta on Sunday by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, AbdulWaheed Odusile, it was said that security agencies have been directed to arrest and prosecute any operative of the NURTW. DAILY POST learnt that the state government had gathered intelligence reports from security agencies that the NURTW is planning to resume collection of dues and revenues on its behalf at motor parks and garages in the state. This, Odusile said, was against a decision of the government banning the activities of the NURTW in the state. “It will be recalled that following the crisis in the leadership of the NURTW in the State that threatened security of lives and properties, particularly public transport in the State, the House of Assembly in June 2020 passed a resolution suspending the activities of the union in the State. “The government subsequently banned the activities of the union in all motor parks and garages in the State,” “Security agencies have been given firm directive to arrest and prosecute any operative of the NURTW or indeed anyone, group or association that has not been approved by the government to act on its behalf that attempts to defy the decision of the government or test its resolve to maintain peace and security in all parts of the state, including the motor parks,” he said.
