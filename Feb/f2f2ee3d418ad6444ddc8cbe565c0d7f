The Cross River State Sector Commander of Federal Road Safety Corp (FRSC), Cyprian Offordu, has confirmed that 12 persons died in two fatal motor accidents that occurred in the state. Briefing newsmen at the Ernest Etim Bassey Press Centre in Calabar, Cross River State on Monday, the Commander regretted the accidents and blamed it on drivers’ recklessness. He said, “The rate of accidents which we thought we have handled during the ember period just from nowhere started reoccurring. Last Thursday, we had two fatal accidents that claimed 12 lives. To us, it’s not acceptable, I am not happy with what is happening despite all the efforts we have put in place. “I thought that after taking care of the ember months and the end of the year, the rate of accidents will not go up again, given what we have put in place but what we had last Thursday surprises us and it’s not acceptable. “We appeal to drivers to be more careful as the recent accidents were caused by them. The drivers were desperate. We talk to transport companies and educate them but the drivers who convey passengers on the roads cause most of these problems, they don’t obey traffic rules,” he stated. DAILY POST gathered that one of the accidents occurred on Thursday at about 9.55am in Okurikang in Odukpani Local Government Area of the state while the other occurred at Okuni near Ikom Local Government Area. The Sector Commander said that 9 persons, including seven men and two women died at Okurikang while three persons lost their lives in the crash that occurred at Okuni. Three persons survived the Okurikang accident while five persons survived the Okuni auto crash. “The Okurikang accident involved a MAC truck and a passenger Hiace bus.”
