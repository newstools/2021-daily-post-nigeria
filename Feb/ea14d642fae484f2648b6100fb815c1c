He announced that the House will not read the Letter from the President on the nominated service chiefs. Speaking on Mr Prestige, Gbajabiamila disclosed that “Prestige had been sick for a while, since the summer of last year. He was in a hospital in the UK, I went there to see him before he was later transferred to Germany. “When I visited him in the UK, he narrated how he travelled to the UK, what happened during the flight, it was pathetic.” The House will also be announcing a new COVID-19 guideline.
