The decomposing body of Victor Becker, 72-year-old veteran Nollywood actor, was found at his apartment in Abuja on Monday. His neighbours discovered the body on Monday evening. The sad news was shared by Jesse Nazareth, Mayor of the Actors Guild of Nigeria, Abuja on Tuesday Nazareth confirmed that Decker’s neighbours broke down the door to his apartment and found his lifeless decomposing body in his sitting room. “Yes, Victor Decker is dead,” She said. “I am in the mortuary where they want to embalm him. I am not aware of the cause of his death. “I just got a call that his neighbours did not see him for days so they got concerned. “They went to his house, knocked on his door but got no response so they had to break down the door. That was when they saw him sitting on his chair lifeless. “He was already smelling as he was decomposing. I rushed down there to arrange the necessary things.” Nazareth said she had to obtain a police report and car to carry the body to a hospital, adding that most hospitals rejected the body of the late actor. According to her, they were referred to a private hospital in Bwari, Abuja, where the body was finally accepted on Tuesday morning. She said the hospital will first reduce the size of the swollen body before they embalm him.
