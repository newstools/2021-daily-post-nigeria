Uche Secondus, National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Thursday, warned the All Progressives Congress, APC, against poaching its members, ahead of 2023. Secondus said APC should focus on fixing Nigeria’s broken economy and security, rather than poaching opposition members. The PDP National Chairman stated this during a meeting between former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode and the party’s National Working Committee, NWC, in Abuja. According to Secondus: “We advise our brothers on the other side, especially some of these governors and leaders of APC that they should face the business of governance. “Jumping around and looking for critical stakeholders of our party to poach will not resolve the issue of security or economy. “They are aware that security has broken down, the economy has broken down. They should face that business for which they were elected. “Our brother is firm and a man of his word. There is no amount of trick that will make him sway otherwise. He is firm with PDP and we are back to business while will prepare for 2023.”
