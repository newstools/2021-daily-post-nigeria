The Osun State Government has announced that 11,068 candidates made the cut-off points for the ongoing teachers recruitment in the state. Recall that about 27,000 applicants across designated centres in the state sat for the Computer-Based Test conducted by the state government. In a statement released on Monday by the Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Funke Egbemode, after the week’s State’s Executive Council Meeting, said 13 persons with special needs were also included. The statement reads in part: “Contrary to the faulty statistics that had been in circulation on the social media, the government has released the official result of the qualifying examination for teachers. “A total of 5,216 candidates made the cut-off mark for post-basic schools, being 40% and above, while a total of 5,852 candidates made the cut-off mark for primary schools, being 35%. “This brings the total qualified candidates to 11,068 after the first round of the recruitment exercise. “Those who qualified after this round will proceed to the stage of proficiency interview and micro-teaching in areas of specialisation at a date that will be communicated soon. “The government has shown generosity and understanding with its benchmark, but will not fail to uphold professionalism and merit in the recruitment process. “Candidates who make the shortlist after the CBT screening are advised to upscale their preparation for subsequent rounds of interviews and give a good account of themselves to make the merit list. “The teaching profession is a very crucial one that has a strong implication for the future of a society. Teachers are very important in building a society and securing the future of a nation,” the statement added.
