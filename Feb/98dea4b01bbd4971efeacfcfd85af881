The federal government has ordered the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) ensure television stations deploy sign language interpreters during news airing. Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, gave the directive on Monday when he received
executives of the Centre for Citizens with Disabilities. “I can assure you that a directive will go out to television stations pointing their attention to the relevant provisions of the Broadcasting Code.” Mohammed added that the order will take effect in a few weeks. He said the ministry will collaborate with the Centre to implement Section Two of the Discrimination Against Persons With Disability (Prohibition) Act to promote the awareness of the rights and capabilities of persons with disabilities. Mohammed said government’s Social Intervention Programmes, including the Survival Fund, earmarked 10 percent of benefits to people with special needs. Executive Director of the Centre, David Anyaele, commended President Muhammadu Buhari for signing the Disability Act and the establishment of the National Commission for Persons with Disability. He urged ministries, departments and agencies to comply with the provision on reservation of at least 5 percent of employment opportunities for persons living with disability. The Disability Act prohibits all forms of discrimination on ground of disability. It imposes a fine of N1million for corporate bodies and N100,000 for individuals or a term of six months imprisonment for violation. The law, among others, prohibits discrimination in public transportation facilities and directs service providers to make provision for persons with physical, visual and hearing impairment.
