A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, has disclosed that the south would block oil supply to the north, if the northern states stop the supply of food to the south. There are reports that some northerners have decided to stop the transportation of food items, including cows to the southern part of Nigeria. This, it was gathered, was as a result of the crises between southerners and northerners, especially the Shasha market riot in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital as well as the herders-farmers clashes in different parts of the region. According to Fani-Kayode, if the north blocks food supplies to the south, the south will in return block the supply of oil, refined products and oil money to the north. The former Aviation Minister said this in a post on his social media handle on Saturday night. He said: “If the north blocks food supplies to the south, the south will block the supply of oil, refined products and oil money to the north. You touch me, I touch you! You do me, I do you! You Tarka me, I Daboh you! “It’s called the law of reciprocity. Never start a dance you can’t finish!” Recall that the oil producing states are in the southern part of Nigeria.
