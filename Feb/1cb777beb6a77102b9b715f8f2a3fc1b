A young housewife in Kaduna, Marwanatu Muhammad has asked a Shari’a court sitting in Rigasa, Kaduna State, to dissolve her 10-year-old marriage to Iliyasu, on the grounds of infertility. Marwanatu told the court on Monday that her husband, Iliyasu has been unable to impregnate her since their marriage in 2011. “He was married before now but the wife left him due to his infertility issues. I thought my case would be different but I was wrong. ”I am okay and have no health issue. I am no longer interested in the marriage. I am ready to return the N20, 000 dowry he paid,” she said. Meanwhile, Iliyasu while defending himself said his wife, Marwanatu was owing him N17, 700. He begged the court to assist him to recover the money from his divorce-seeking wife. However, the judge, Malam Salisu Abubakar-Tureta held that the union had been dissolved through Khul’I (redemption) and adjourned the matter until Feb. 24 to enable the complainant to produce the N20, 000 dowry and to swear.
