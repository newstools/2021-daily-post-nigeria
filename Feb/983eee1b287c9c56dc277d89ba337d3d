Thomas Tuchel has revealed that he told forward Callum Hudson-Odoi that subbing on and off again during the second half of their 1-1 draw with Southampton on Saturday was no big deal. The German said that other Chelsea players should expect such decisions and hinted that the England winger could start against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday evening. Hudson-Odoi came off the bench for Chelsea at half-time during our 1-1 draw, before being subbed off again 15 minutes before the end. “It is not a big thing at all for me,” Tuchel said of the decision to sub Hudson-Odoi, according to Chelsea official website. “I have spoken to Callum, and I’ve spoken to the whole group. Sometimes, these things happen in football and it was just my decision. “For me, this is absolutely not a big thing and only becomes one if people want to talk about it. “He has started a lot of games for me and in this instance; he has taken a hard decision. Now he must swallow it and come into training ready to work ahead of Atletico, a game which he has every chance of starting.” Going into the first leg last 16 tie against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, Chelsea remain unbeaten under Thomas Tuchel’s over one month’s reign at Stamford Bridge.
