An Ekiti State Chief Magistrate Court sitting in Ado Ekiti has ordered that one Ajibola Odebo , 40, be remanded in the Nigerian Correctional Centre, Ado Ekiti, for allegedly raping a minor. Ordering the accused person to be remanded in Correctional Centre, magistrate Dolapo Fasuba, frowned at the incessant and increasing offences of rape and sexual assault in the society. “I call on all stakeholders in the administration of criminal justice not to relent in their efforts in protecting girl’s child rights and nipping the offence of rape in the bud. According to the police prosecutor, Inspector Oriyomi Akinwale, the offence was committed in Ado Ekiti when the accused raped a 12-year-old girl. The case was adjourned to 18th March, 2021 for mention. It was believed that before then, the office of the Department of Public Prosecution must have given legal advice in respect of the case.
