Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has confirmed that centre-back, Rob Holding, will miss the Gunners’ Europa League last-32 second leg tie against Benfica on Thursday. Arteta also provided the latest injury update on Midfielder, Thomas Partey ahead of Arsenal’s clash with Benfica at the Karaiskakis Stadium. Arteta said Partey is ‘very close’ to a return from the treatment room. According to him, the Ghanaian international is in contention for the upcoming fixtures against Benfica and Leicester City on Sunday. Recall that Partey picked up an injury during Arsenal’s Premier League 1-0 defeat against Aston Villa at Villa Park earlier this month. “Thomas [Partey] is very close, he’s got a final test today in training, and if he is feeling good, he will be available,” Arteta said on Wednesday morning. “Regarding Rob [Holding], he is not available. He had a concussion. We used that [substitution]. He is completely fine, but obviously, now we need to follow the protocols, and he won’t be able to travel.” He added, “I cannot wait to have our fans back in the stadium. All the players are desperate to have them back. The energy they can create, the passion they can show for our players is something we have been really missing.” Arsenal played a 1-1 draw with Benfica in the first-leg encounter last week.
