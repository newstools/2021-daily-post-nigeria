Yobe State Police Command has cautioned citizens of the State to be more vigilant following the influx of large number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) into the State. ASP Dungus Abdulkarim, the Command’s Public Relations Officer, in a statement released on Thursday, indicated that the new arrivals are mostly from Gubio, Magumeri, Kaga, as well as Kunduga local government areas of Borno State. The PPRO believed that the IDPs relocated from their ancestral homes due to incessant attacks by unknown gunmen terrorizing their communities while in search of food items and other valuables. “In a proactive move, over two thousand (2,000) IDPs so far have been profiled by the command for security reasons, while the influx of persons into the state is yet ongoing. “The new arrivals have so far settled in areas which includes Geidam, Tarmuwa, and Gujba LGAs of Yobe state as well as Isori, Kukareta, Kasesa and Kalallawa villages around the state capital, Damaturu”, Abdulkarim noted. He added that the Command had since commenced investigation with regards to the causes of the displacement, while placing necessary strategies to ensure public safety and prevent criminal elements from taking advantage of the situation. The PPRO, however, on behalf of the Command urged the good people of Yobe State “to be vigilant and report all suspicious person(s), object(s) and vehicle(s) to the nearest Police Station or formation.”
