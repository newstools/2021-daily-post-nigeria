Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu has mourned the passing of former Minister of Information and Culture, Prince Tony Momoh. The Governor described Momoh’s death as a colossal loss to Nigeria and the All Progressives Congress, APC. A statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Gboyega Akosile, on Monday, said Nigeria would miss the rich experience and knowledge of the former Daily Times Editor, especially his contributions to national issues through politics and his editorial contents. Sanwo-olu urged family, friends and colleagues of the deceased to work towards immortalising the late Momoh. He said: “As a democrat, he played active roles in the formation of various political platforms at the transition stage of Nigeria from military dictatorship to civilian rule. He led his former party, the Congress for Political Change (CPC) to form the APC with other political Parties and contributed positively to the party’s victories in the 2015 and 2019 general elections.” He prayed that God will grant Momoh eternal rest and give the immediate family and friends the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.
