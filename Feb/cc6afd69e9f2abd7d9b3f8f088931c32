On Tuesday, a farmer, Abdulahi Onilari, told a Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan that his wife, Rofiat, was still romantically involved with her ex-husband. In a divorce petition, Onilari told the court to dissolve the 5-year-old marriage. “My wife holds romantic meetings with her former husband,” he alleged. “Rofiat is also arrogant. She disobeys all my instructions and family guidelines. “She dresses provocatively. Rofiat stopped covering her head with veils and vowed not to observe the five daily prayers. She sends and receives romantic messages from her former husband, Lord.” On her part, Rofiat consented to the suit. She said,” He is a pathological liar. I saw my former husband over ten years ago. I do not have anything to do with him.” However, delivering his judgment, the court’s President, Chief Ademola Odunade, dissolved the union in the interest of peace. Odunade granted custody of the two children to Rofiat and instructed Onilari to pay N10,000 as monthly feeding allowance.
