Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has slammed Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho for making “excuses” following his side’s Premier League 1-0 defeat to Chelsea on Thursday night. Jorginho scored from the penalty spot following Eric Dier’s clumsy challenge on Timo Werner in the first half to give Thomas Tuchel’s side all three points against Spurs. Mourinho had decided to focus on Chelsea’s penalty decision rather than finding fault with Tottenham’s performance, even though he did choose to criticize striker, Carlos Vinicius for lacking ‘understanding on how to press properly’ during the game. However, after watching Mourinho’s interview, Ferdinand slammed his excuses and said that Mourinho’s Tottenham had no game plan against Chelsea, adding that they lacked direction during the match. “I just hope that his conversation and the way he talks to the team is very different from what I just saw there,” Ferdinand told BT Sport. “Because that was an excuses-filled interview more than anything. I understand the manager coming out and dressing down your players in public may not be the way to do it in today’s game, but you really do hope those players are getting the message that’s very different to that. “We can talk about [Heung-min] Son, and we can talk about Kane, but that doesn’t come away from the fact there doesn’t seem to be any game-plan, even getting out from the back. “There’s no movement. There’s no game plan. There’s no direction with this team. I just see people playing off the cuff, hoping to get it to Ndombele at the moment who is going to do something to get Son in if that happens. “They had one shot all game, and that was in the 89th minute.” The result means Tottenham are now in the eighth position on the Premier League table with 33 points from 21 games.
