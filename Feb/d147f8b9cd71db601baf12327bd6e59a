A Senior Magistrates’ Court in Kano, on Wednesday, ordered the remand of a 30-year-old housewife, Hauwa Auwal, in a correctional centre. She allegedly poured hot water on her co-wife and daughter. Auwal, a resident of Sheka Sabuwar Abuja Quarters, Kano, faces one-count charge of attempt to commit culpable homicide. The Prosecutor, Amina Yahaya, told the court that the husband, Babangida Ibrahim reported the case at Sheka Police Division Kano on January 22. At about 8:21p.m. on that day, Auwal, the second wife, had a misunderstanding with the first wife, Sha’awa Isma’il. In the process, Auwal poured a full bucket of hot water on Sha’awa and her four-year-old daughter, Halima Khalil, according to Yahaya. The victims were rushed to Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital, Kano, and are currently receiving treatment. Auwal pleaded not guilty to the charge. The prosecutor opposed the bail application made by her lawyer. The counsel, Hassan Umar, made an oral bail application citing Sections 172 and 175 of Kano State Administration of Criminal Justice Law. “The defendant is pregnant and could give birth any moment. If granted bail she will not jump bail,” he said. Senior Magistrate Talatu Makama dismissed the application. Makama said the offence was capital in nature and the court has no jurisdiction to grant her bail. She ordered the remand of the accused in a correctional centre and directed her counsel to seek bail in the State High Court. The matter was adjourned until March 8.
