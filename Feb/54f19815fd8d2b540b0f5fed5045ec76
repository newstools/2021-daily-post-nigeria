Commercial activities in Iloko-Ijesa, a town in Oriade local government council area of Osun State were today disrupted as youths took to the major streets of the town brandishing different placards and calling on the state government to look into the matter of approving a traditional ruler for them. The youths, who were numbered in their hundreds, stated that Iloko, being a peaceful community has been without a traditional ruler for eight years, adding that the situation has held back development in the town since 2012 when the last monarch, Owaloko of Iloko-Ijesa, Oba Oladele Olashore died. The coordinator of the youths in the town, Chief Kehinde Odeyemi, told DAILY POST that all they wanted was for the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola to do the needful and announce the choice which the kingmakers have chosen among the princes presented as the Owaloko of Iloko-Ijesa. He stated that the town which has been without a king has been suffering and been on a stand still since 2012. In pleading with the state government to approve the nominated prince as king for them, Odeyemi explained that the people of Iloko-Ijesa were law-abiding and peaceful but were not happy with the situation on ground. Another youth, Jacob Omojola, noted that some towns which lost their traditional rulers after 2012 have had their kings installed. “Ooni of Ife, Oniwoye of Iwoye, Elegbero of Ijebu-Ijesa, Olomo of Omoo-Ijesa, Oluwo of Iwo and so many kings that died after ours have been approved and installed by the state government.” The representative of Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in the local government while addressing the protesting youths urged them not to allow their peaceful protest to be hijacked by hoodlums as it will send the wrong signal to those in authority. He also commended the way the protest was held in compliance of the COVID-19 guidelines.
