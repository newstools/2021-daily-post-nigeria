Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said that Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has done really well at Stamford Bridge since he took over from Frank Lampard last January. Solskjaer said that the current Chelsea squad under Tuchel has the ability to keep teams away from their own goal. He also said that his job is to end Tuchel’s unbeaten run at Chelsea so far. The Norwegian spoke on Friday during his pre-match press conference ahead of Man United’s away Premier League clash with Chelsea on Sunday. Tuchel has won six of his last eight matches in charge of Chelsea since his appointment last month. “You can see in the results, stats and possession they have had, the ability to keep teams away from their own goal, he’s done really well,” Tuchel said. “It is never easy coming into a season halfway through, and he must be pleased as well, but hopefully, we can stop that run. That is my job now.”
