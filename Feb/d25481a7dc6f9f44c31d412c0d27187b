A House of Representatives member, Benjamin Kalu says pressure from constituents for various needs is killing Nigerian lawmakers. The All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain in Abia spoke to newsmen after the House adjourned sitting to mourn Rep Ossy Prestige (APGA-Abia). Prestige, 56, passed away in Germany during an illness. Kalu said that members of the National Assembly were under pressure for various needs. He said this had deteriorated the health conditions of many of his colleagues. “These guys here are suffering, they are under stress that is why most of the sickness they are passing through is heart attack and failure of organs due to stress for their constituents. “That is the truth and the truth must be told, whether you want to understand it or not, let the press know that the pressure from constituents is killing members of the National Assembly. “That is the truth, the pressure is too much, people are receiving pressure from constituents on issues that is way out of the scope”, NAN quoted him as saying Kalu regretted that lawmakers were asked to build roads, hospitals and others. The lawmaker said most members who do not know how to explain to their constituents carry the pressure with them.
