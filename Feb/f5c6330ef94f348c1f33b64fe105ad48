President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad, on Monday, debunked reports that he has been appointed as a manager of the Department of Petroleum Resources, DPR. Reports had emerged from an online news blog that President Buhari silently appointed Ahmad as a manager of the DPR. However, reacting to the development, Ahmad in a tweet via his Twitter handle said the report was false. He tweeted, “A friend sent me a link to a concocted story from an online news blog that the President has quietly appointed me as a manager of the DPR, Department of Petroleum Resources, for those who want to know the truth, the story is 100% FALSE. I am not a staff of the DPR.” Meanwhile, Mr Paul Osu, Head, Public Affairs of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), had disclosed last week Monday that President Buhari will virtually inaugurate the National Oil and Gas Excellence Centre (NOGEC), Lagos, on January 21, in a bid to boost the operations of the nation’s petroleum sector. Osu, in a statement in Lagos, quoted the Director of DPR, Mr Sarki Auwalu, as saying that the centre would afford the oil and gas industry the critical elements for competitive advantage, in a changing global energy landscape.
