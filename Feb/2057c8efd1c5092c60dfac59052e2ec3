The Rivers State Police Command has disbanded one of its Tactical Units, Eagle Crack Unit over the illegal activities of its men. The E-Crack Unit became the new Special Anti-Robbery Squad because of their notoriety especially with regard to the violation of human rights. The E-Crack Unit also currently occupies the building of the defunct F0 SARS at Rukpokwu, Obio-Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. The latest incident involved the extortion of three undergraduate students of the University of Port Harcourt where E-Crack officers led the students to an ATM to make cash transfer of N150,000. “The cash transfer was traced to one of our officers,” the spokesman of the State Police Command, SP Nnamdi Omoni said. However, in a swift reaction to the several complaints of residents of Rivers State, the new Commissioner of Police, CP Friday Eboka disbanded the E-Crack. CP Eboka said the decision was taken Friday morning after a meeting with his Management Team. The Command in a statement said, “The dissolution is coming on the heels of complaints of unprofessional conduct exhibited by personnel of the unit. “Recall that the CP in his Maiden Press Briefing on Tuesday promised to address all cases of infractions by the Police and increase supervision of the men, with a stern warning to deal with erring officers and hold DPOs/HODs vicariously liable. “The dissolution is with immediate effect and all personnel attached to the unit are to report to the headquarters for redeployment. ”The public is hereby enjoined to rekindle their trust in the police, as the command is committed to giving them improved policing services that will stand the test of time.”
