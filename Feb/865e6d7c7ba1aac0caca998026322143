Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has insisted that the Nigerian constitution allows every citizen to reside in any part of the country, adding that Nigerians do not need to seek permission from any authority to dwell in any state. Recall that following the recent crisis between herders and residents of some parts of the South-west, Governor Akeredolu of Ondo State had ordered all herdsmen to vacate the state’s forest reserves or register with the state government. But tge Bauchi State Governor while speaking on Channels Television’s programme, ‘Sunrise Daily’ on Friday, claimed that those who choose to live in the forest have the backing of the law. He said, “Land is in the hands of the state and federal governments in trust but Nigerians don’t need the permission of governors or the federal government to settle anywhere. You don’t need the permission of the governor of Bauchi or the governor of Ondo to be in the forests of Ondo if you choose to live in the forests because under Section 41 of the constitution, you are free to settle anywhere.” While speaking on self-protection, the governor who recently said that herders have the right to bear AK-47 rifle, said, “when we mention AK-47, it is a figure of speech, the issue is protection, self-help, you must protect yourself. “The Fulani man is so exposed, dehumanised and demonised. He is being seen as a bandit and so anywhere he goes, his commonwealth which I call his cows are being taken and rustled and sometimes they are fined beyond your imagination and then he has no option than to protect himself,” the governor added.
