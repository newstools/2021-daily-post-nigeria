Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, on Thursday, revalidated his membership status within the All Progressives Congress, APC. Akeredolu revalidated his status alongside his wife, Betty at his Ijebu 2 ward 5, polling unit 6 in Owo Local Government Area of the state. During the exercise, the governor declared that APC has come to stay in the state, adding that it is the only party known among residents of the state. While urging members and leaders of the party to bring more members into the party, Akeredolu said they must ensure that only quality people who will be committed to the party are attracted. “I know some of us have registered before, I have registered before too and that’s why I can contest under the party. “We are here to revalidate our membership. If you haven’t registered before, do it afresh. Bring your passport size photograph. We are here for revalidation and registration.” Earlier, the Secretary of the Registration Committee, Taiwo Olatunbosun, said there will be no proxy registration, stressing that individuals who wish to register or revalidate membership must be physically present. Olatubosun further explained that the essence of the revalidation and registration exercise was to enable the party to have a reliable document that would contain the actual number of party members which will also help in its empowerment programs.
