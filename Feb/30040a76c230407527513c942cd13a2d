The Adamawa State Police Command has confirmed the lynching of a youth suspected to be one of the young gangsters known in the state as Shila Boys. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Suleiman Nguroje, said Sunday that the mob action was carried out in Jimeta, the part of the state capital, Yola, most affected by activities of the Shila Boys. Sulaiman Nguroje said the Shila boy was burnt to death by an angry mob for allegedly robbing and stabbing a lady at a busy spot in Jimeta called Mubi Roundabout. According to the PPRO, the incident occurred in the evening of Saturday. He disclosed that the crowd found that the suspects were three but two escaped. “The lady being robbed shouted for help and immediately, individuals around the place gathered, chased the three suspects and succeeded in catching one and burning him alive,” he said. He added that the corpse was evacuated by the Jimeta Police Division. Shila Boys were a raging crop of young gangsters up to the coming of Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, but Fintiri came in with an apparent resolve to tame them and they eased off, until the government and the police began to count it as a huge achievement, and then they rose once again, harassing Yola residents day and night.
