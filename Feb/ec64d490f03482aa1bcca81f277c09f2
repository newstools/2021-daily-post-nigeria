Former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Chelsea to beat Sheffield United when both teams clash in the Premier League tonight. Owen also predicted Liverpool to play a draw with Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City on Sunday evening at Anfield. Providing his predictions, Owen told BetVictor: “It’s two wins and three clean sheets for Chelsea under new boss Thomas Tuchel. The Blues have certainly looked more solid since the German has arrived, with Thursday’s win at Tottenham testament to that. “They travel to the Steel City to take on a resurgent Sheffield United side. The Blades are putting in a late run to escape relegation, although they’ve probably left it too late. “United have been impressive in recent weeks, however, Chelsea are growing in confidence, and I think Tuchel may be the man to unlock the potential of fellow countryman Timo Werner. I reckon the German could notch here in an away win. Sheffield United 0, Chelsea 2.” On the Liverpool vs Manchester City game, Owen said, “This is a must-win for Liverpool. Anything other than a victory would be a real dent in their aspirations to retain the title. “City arrive here in great form, although I do think that deep down, Pep would happily take a point home. “With that in mind, I think City could give up some territory. From their point of view, if they get one on the counter, then great. If not, a point is not a bad result. “Usually, in these types of matches, a noisy Anfield crowd would play a huge part. With that missing, I think it only plays further into City’s hands. “So, I can see this being cagey, and I would not be surprised if it ended all square. Liverpool 1, Manchester City 1.” The kick-off time for Sheffield vs Chelsea is 8:15 pm, while that of Liverpool vs Man City is 5:30 pm.
