Recall that Kachalla was killed late December 2020, during a clash between his gang and a rival group of bandits, which occurred in a forest around the boundaries of Kajuru-Chikun Local Government Area of the state. The clash was triggered by a dispute over a large herd of rustled cattle According to a statement by the state Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, in a statement, the weapons were recovered with the aid of local human intelligence sources. The statement said Kachalla and his gang were involved in several crimes, including high-profile kidnappings, killings and banditry on the Kaduna-Abuja road and also in the Chikun/Kajuru general areas. Governor Nasir El-Rufai noted the report with thanks, and commended the security agencies for recovering the weapons. He urged them to pursue all available leads towards exposing more arms caches used by bandits. Efforts to recover more of such weapons are in progress.
