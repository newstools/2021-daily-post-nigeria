Real Madrid midfielder, Casemiro, has said that Zinedine Zidane’s side believe they can win the La Liga title after his goal earned a 1-0 win at Real Valladolid on Saturday evening. Casemiro’s goal against Valladolid narrowed the gap with leaders Atletico Madrid to just three points on Saturday. The result came after title favourites Atletico Madrid were beaten 2-0 by Levante earlier on Saturday for their first home La Liga loss since Dec. 2019. “It is not just because Atletico Madrid lost. We believe [we can win] the league,” Casemiro said at a post-match press conference. “I think there are still 42 points left. That is a lot of points. “We know there’s a lot of league left. We know it’s difficult, but we believe in the league.” Real Madrid’s next game is against Atalanta in the Champions League round of 16 first-leg on Wednesday.
