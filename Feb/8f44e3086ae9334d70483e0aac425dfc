The All Progressives Congress (APC) has called for a tighter security around schools in order to curb kidnapping in the country. The party said this in a statement issued by Sen. John Akpanudoedehe, National Secretary of its Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC)on Saturday. Akpanudoedehe welcomed the release of the Kagara schools children, teachers and their family members. Part of statement read: “It is truly heart-warming that the abductees have reunited with their families and loved ones. “We appreciate the government’s efforts at all levels including non-state actors, which ensured the safe release of the abductees. “While President Muhammadu Buhari government’s resolve and capacity to end cowardly attacks on soft targets, is not in doubt, we must collectively do more to end the scourge, particularly tighter security around schools.” Akpanudoedehe gave assurance that the government was focused on the safe release of students abducted by bandits from Government Girls Junior Secondary School Jangebe, Zamfara.
