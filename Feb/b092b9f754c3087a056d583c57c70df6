The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has joined the family, friends and political associates of a former Minister of Information, Prince Tony Momoh, to mourn his death. Lawan, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Ola Awoniyi, condoled with the government and people of Edo State and the All Progressives Congress(APC), where he was a highly respected leader, on the loss. He also prayed for divine comfort for his loved ones and for sweet repose of his gentle soul. “Prince Tony Momoh as a journalist made indelible contributions to the development of the noble profession in Nigeria. “As Minister of Information, Prince Momoh, through his ‘Letter to my countrymen’ series, professionally and effectively disseminated and managed public information in a manner that was unique to him. “As chairman of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), he helped nurture the party to a very strong showing at the polls within months of its formation. “The APC will miss this principled political leader particularly in this period that the party is repositioning as a grassroots-based political party and for improved performance of its leadership of our great country,” Lawan said.
