He added that Suleiman was a tenant in the building, adding that based on intelligence, police had kept watch on the building before it was eventually raided to recover the ammunition and other weapons. The PPRO disclosed that two of the suspects arrested, Muhammed Sanusi and Abba Sa’idu, were the agents who brought the main suspect, Adamu Suleiman into the house.
