Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, hopes to have three of his injured players back in the squad to take on Chelsea this weekend. The Red Devils qualified for the last 16 of the Europa League on Thursday night after a 0-0 draw against Real Sociedad at Old Trafford, having won 4-0 in the first leg last week. The downside was Daniel James being subbed off with a hamstring problem. But Solskjaer does not believe the injury is serious and is hopeful that Scott McTominay, Donny van de Beek and Edinson Cavani will all be fit to take on Chelsea on Sunday. “Hopefully we’ll get a few players back in and Dan tonight was hopefully not too bad,” Solskjaer told BT Sport after the match. “He felt a tweak so we’ll have to check on him tonight. “Then Scott, Donny and Edinson we hope that they can be available for the weekend, I’m not sure. Paul [Pogba] is still out a few weeks unfortunately.”
