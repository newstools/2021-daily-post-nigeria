Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has hit out at referee Stuart Attwell for checking Video Assistant Referee (VAR) monitor, after Callum Hudson-Odoi’s handball in the first half of their 0-0 draw with Manchester United. Attwell decided not to award a spot-kick after consulting the on-pitch screen. Hudson-Odoi touched the ball with his hand in the penalty area, while fighting with Mason Greenwood for possession during the first half. Tuchel, speaking to the media after the game, insisted that the incident was not worthy of a review. He said: “How can this be a VAR intervention? The player in red plays the ball with the hand and then we are checking for a penalty? Why does the referee have to see this? “I’ve seen it on the iPad, I don’t understand why the referee has to check it but I’m glad it was no penalty. That would make it even worse.”
