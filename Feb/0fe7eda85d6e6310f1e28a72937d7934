The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has declared Kogi State a high-risk state for refusing to acknowledge the existence of the virus. The federal government said the Kogi government had failed to report testing, lacked isolation centers. The PTF warned Nigerians against visiting the state. National Incident Manager (NIM) of the PTF COVID-19 pandemic, Mukhtar Muhammad, spoke on Monday in Abuja at the PTF briefing on COVID-19. “We have states where data is not coming forth. If we don’t test, your data will not be analysed and if your data is not analysed, we won’t know the level of the pandemic in your state. “Notable among the states are Yobe, Jigawa, Zamfara and Kebbi and of course Kogi that have not been reported at all. “States that are not testing are probably at much higher risk than the states that are currently known as high burdened states. “A state that is not testing at all is an absolute high risk for Nigerians to visit because there is no testing facility and even if you fall sick, there is no isolation center and they don’t even acknowledge that the disease exists. So for that reason, we put that state at the top of high risk states.”
