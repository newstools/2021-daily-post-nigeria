Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has identified one area his team needs to improve after their 2-0 defeat against Everton in the Premier League on Saturday. Klopp said Liverpool needs to improve in their ability to be ‘decisive’ in crucial moments in both defence and attack. Two goals from Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson gave Everton all three points against Liverpool at Anfield. “We conceded a completely unnecessary first goal, and we should not forget that,” Klopp said. “That’s a big part of the game. There were two big parts. You have to defend and we have to score.” Klopp added: “In the decisive moments, we have to be calmer. Like in the finishing situations, and I don’t mean now the headers from Sadio, which were really tricky with circumstances we had tonight, or the chance from Mo where it was super played with Shaqiri and Trent when Mo is alone and that’s then really difficult because Pickford is in front of him, a short distance. “But we had other situations where we had really finishing opportunities, and we didn’t finish the situations off. “But to change a football game, results, to get the result, you have to be decisive in the right moments defensively and offensively – and that’s what we are lacking.”
