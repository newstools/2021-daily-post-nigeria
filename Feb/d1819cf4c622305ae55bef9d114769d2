Samuel Ani, a community leader in the crisis-ridden Oruku community in Nkanu Local Government of Enugu State, has been murdered. NAN reports that he was shot dead on Wednesday by gunmen. Until his death, Ani was the Vice Chairman, Oruku Caretaker Committee. The killing occurred nine weeks after Oruku traditional ruler, Igwe Emmanuel Mbah was gunned down while addressing his subjects. The December 26, 2020 incident triggered a disorder that led to destruction of lives and property in the community. The state government constituted a Commission of Inquiry to look into the matter. Ani was expected to appear before the panel this Friday. The Police Command in Enugu confirmed the assassination in a statement. Public Relations Officer, Daniel Ndukwe, said a report was received at about 7.30 a.m on Wednesday. Residents said hoodlums, suspected to be among the warring factions of Oruku Community, shot Ani at his residence. The spokesman assured that the command will apprehend perpetrators of the fresh crisis. Ndukwe said Police Commissioner, Mohammed Aliyu, urged law-abiding people in the area to remain calm.
