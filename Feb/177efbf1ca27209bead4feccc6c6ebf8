Manchester United executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, “had tears in his eyes” as he showed former Anderlecht chief, Michael Verschueren, the criticism he received from fans. Woodward replaced David Gill at Old Trafford in 2013, but has been unable to carry on United’s success. He has hired and fired the likes of Louis van Gaal, David Moyes and Jose Mourinho, while also sanctioning many big money signings that have flopped. It left fans furious, with many of them taking to social media to express their dissatisfaction. “Two years ago, I was accompanied by Ed Woodward, the CEO of Man Utd, who was going through a slump at the time. “He showed me tweets from supporters: ‘Look Michael, how cruel the fans can be’ – the tears were in his eyes. “Today Manchester United are the leader [second] in the Premier League,” Verschueren told Het Laatste Nieuws. United host Everton on Saturday night, firmly in the Premier League title race.
