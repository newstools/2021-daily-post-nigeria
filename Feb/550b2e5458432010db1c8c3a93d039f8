The Osun State Ministry of Education has called on the public to regard as fake the statistics trending on social media regarding the just concluded teachers recruitment examination in the state. In a press release signed by the Commissioner, Folorunso Oladoyin Bamisayemi and made available to DAILY POST, the statistics was described as fake and the handiwork of alarmists and negative propagandists whose sole aim was to create an atmosphere of confusion. The Commissioner disclosed that he would give a comprehensive analysis on the outcome of the exercise to the public after briefing the State’s Executive Council tomorrow, Monday, 15th February, 2021. The reason for this he noted was in line with the standard practice as obtained in other parts of the world. “It is standard and best practice to first report to one’s principal and his management team before addressing the press.” While observing that the performance in the recruitment examination compared favourably with what was expected in a standard examination of such nature, he assured that the overall performance was not as woeful as the fake reports had intended. The breakdown of the fake statistics in circulation on the social media according to the press release issued is thus:
50% and above = 3.5%
40% to 49% = 7.5%
30% to 39% = 39%
29% to zero = 50%. Recall that a teachers’ recruitment test was held in Osun State between Tuesday, 9th February and Wednesday 10th, February, 2021.
