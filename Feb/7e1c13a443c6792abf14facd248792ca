Former presidential aide and senator representing Anambra South senatorial zone, Senator Andy Uba has reiterated his interest in the growth of the All Progressives Congress, APC in Anambra state. The former lawmaker said this while denying recent reports that he hijacked the membership revalidation and registration exercise in the state, insisting that he had nothing to gain from such. In a press statement issued by his media office on Wednesday, the former lawmaker said, “As you can see, the APC in Anambra has been having a seamless registration exercise where citizens of the state owing to the numerous successes of the Federal Government in the state are daily registering in their hundreds with the party. “Part of this success can be attributed to the efforts of Senator Andy Uba who mobilized every ward in the party with funds and logistics to encourage the people to identify with the party in this current registration exercise. “It is surprising to see news stories running wild with frivolous allegations on an attempt by our principal to hijack the process. Such stories had even accused supporters of the senator both imaginary and real of attacking the state party chairman, Chief Basil Ejidike but they are all false. “We wonder why any right-thinking human should make such wild accusations, and what Senator Uba, our principal, stands to benefit from derailing the registration process as alleged by these mischievous few. We, therefore, urge party members and the public to kindly disregard such allegations.” The release quoted Uba as being genuinely interested in the growth of APC in Anambra State and has demonstrated so, severally. It said what was focal to Senator Uba was to unite the party so that whosoever got the party ticket in the primaries would defeat every opposition to claim victory come November 6, 2021.
