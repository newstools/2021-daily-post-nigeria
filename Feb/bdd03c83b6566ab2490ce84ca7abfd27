Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has revealed his conversation with Winger, Callum Hudson-Odoi, ahead of his side’s Champions League last-16, first-leg tie with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday night at National Arena in Romania. Tuchel also said he urged Hudson-Odoi to be more “reliable” for Chelsea’s squad when he comes on from the bench. Recall that Hudson-Odoi was a bit disappointed to be named among the substitutes during Chelsea’s 1-1 draw with Southampton at St Mary’s over the weekend. The 20-year-old was brought on for Tammy Abraham at the start of the second half after Takumi Minamino had put Southampton in front. However, the England international lasted just 31 minutes before Hakim Ziyech replaced him in the 76 minutes. “It’s not a big thing at all for me,” Tuchel told Chelsea’s official website. “I have spoken to Callum [Hudson-Odoi], and I have spoken to the whole group. Sometimes these things happen in football, and it was just my decision. “Maybe I was harsh on him because he was on my side of the pitch, and I was up close to him, but I didn’t feel that he was really into the game. “I did not think he was totally sharp, and that’s why I took a hard decision on him. But that decision was in the moment and for that day only. “For me, this is absolutely not a big thing and only becomes one if people want to talk about it. “Callum has been fantastic for me so far, and it is on him to show me that every game and every day in training. “I want him to show me that he’s a reliable guy for the team when he comes on from the bench like he’s when he starts.”
