Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has confirmed that his team will be without four key players when they take on Real Sociedad in tonight’s Europa League last-32 second-leg clash at Old Trafford. The players are Paul Pogba, Scott McTominay, Donny van de Beek and Edinson Cavani. Solskjaer’s men had won the first-leg 4-0 last week. Man United head to the game after beating Newcastle United 3-1 in the Premier League last Sunday. “They [Paul, Scott, Donny and Edinson] will still be missing,” Solskjaer told Man United’s official website. “They have not joined the training, so they won’t be ready. No. “Paul has been outside on the grass and is starting to step up his recovery, but he’s not near the team for this game.” “It will be more or less the same squad that we had against Newcastle,” added Solskjaer at his press conference. “Hannibal is injured for about a month. Amad and Shola will, of course, be involved. They are in the squad, but I am not going to tell you if they are starting or not.” The kick-off time for the match is 9 pm.
