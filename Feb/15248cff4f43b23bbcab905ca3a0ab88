Chelsea star, Hakim Ziyech, has told the club’s manager, Thomas Tuchel that he is happy to play on the right-wing or in midfield ahead of their FA Cup fifth-round tie against Barnsley on Thursday night at Oakwell Stadium. Ziyech also said that he’s pleased to fit in anywhere, as long as he’s getting regular minutes under Tuchel. The Moroccan international has been hampered by injury since his £33 million move to Chelsea from Ajax last summer. The winger has already seen a managerial change at Stamford Bridge, with Frank Lampard sacked and replaced by Tuchel last month. Tuchel included Ziyech in Chelsea’s starting XI for their draw with Wolves but the 27-year-old failed to even make the squad against Burnley. Ziyech has been an unused substitute in the Blues’ last two wins against Tottenham and Sheffield United. “You know what can happen if the results aren’t good enough. It’s not the first time I’ve seen a manager sacked,” Ziyech told Dutch outlet Ziggo Sport. “We will have to see what type of system he [Tuchel] favours. I don’t mind whether I play on the right-wing or in the middle, just so long as I can play. For me, that is the main thing. “I always have faith in myself. I know what I can do, and I won’t put pressure on myself. “The best of Hakim Ziyech is yet to come.”
