The two legs of Arsenal’s Europa League clash with Benfica this month will be played at a neutral venue in Rome, because of COVID-19 travel restrictions, according to The Evening Standard. The Gunners were initially scheduled to travel to Lisbon on February 18 for the first leg, with Benfica arriving at the Emirates a week later on February 25. However, government rules regarding travel between the UK and Portugal, means that can no longer happen.
