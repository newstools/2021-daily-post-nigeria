The Northern Governors Forum on Friday condemned the attack on Government Secondary School, Jangebe in Zamfara State where hundreds of schoolgirls were abducted. The Northern Governors equally urged security operatives to use every asset at their disposal to rescue the children and bring to justice those behind the act. Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, through his Director Press and Public Affairs, Dr. Makut Simon Macham, said the aforementioned trend is unacceptable. He added that strong measures must be taken to put an end to it before it escalates into a monster that will consume “educational pursuit and national aspirations”. Lalong lamented that the sad development which is coming on the heels of the abduction of school children in Kagara, Niger State still being addressed, calls for serious concerns among all Nigerians. “As Northern Governors, we are deeply saddened by this embarrassing and unfortunate attack on our children who are in schools to seek knowledge and build capacity to impact the nation and create a better society. “The assault on schools where innocent and harmless students are targeted should not be condoned in any way because it has the tendency to set the nation back to ignorance and more poverty. “The Northern part of the country in particular is more educationally disadvantaged and cannot afford to have these disruptions. Enough is enough”. The Forum called on the citizenry to support both security operatives and government with credible information that will lead to swift resolution of the unfortunate situation. The Governors sympathised with the families of the abducted school children, the people and Government of Zamfara State. The Forum assured the citizens of its support in tackling the problem.
