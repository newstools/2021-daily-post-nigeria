A housewife, Martha Ojo, on Wednesday, prayed a Customary Court in Jikwoyi, Abuja, to dissolve her 12-year-old marriage to husband, Moses, because he was HIV positive. Ojo also said that Moses disappears every time and only sleeps with her once every two years. She made the allegations in her response to a divorce petition filed by her husband. “My husband became ill when our last child was about six months old. I took him to the hospital for treatment. His health kept on deteriorating. ”The doctor took our blood samples, and it revealed that my husband tested positive for HIV. ”I tested negative. ”My husband disappears every time. He only sleeps with me once in every two years,” she said. Moses, who was also present in court, denied all his wife said about his health. ”I am not HIV positive. My wife and her brother are planning to tarnish my image. They cooked up this story.’’ After listening to both sides, the presiding judge, Jemilu Jega, adjourned the matter until March 9, for judgment.
