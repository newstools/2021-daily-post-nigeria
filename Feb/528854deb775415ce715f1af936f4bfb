A magistrate court in Makurdi, on Monday, ordered that a 40-year-old man, Raphael Terlumun be remanded in a correctional centre for allegedly defiling a minor in the State. The Magistrate, Ajuma Igama did not take Terlumun’s plea for want of jurisdiction. The Magistrate adjourned the case until March 4. Earlier, the prosecution, Sgt.

Godwin said that investigation into the matter was still ongoing and prayed the court for an adjournment. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of Section 284 of the Penal Code of Benue 2004.
