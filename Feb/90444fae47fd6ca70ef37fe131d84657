Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator has confirmed the release of the abducted students of Government Science College, Kagara, in Niger State. Sani said the Principal of the school confirmed their release to him. In a tweet, the former lawmaker wrote: “I spoke with the Principal of GSC Kagara who confirmed the release of the abducted Students.” Bandits had last week abducted 27 students, 12 relatives and 3 staff members from GSC in Kagara. But the students regained their freedom on Saturday morning. It is unclear if ransom was paid for their release. DAILY POST gathered that the victims would be taken to the Government House in Minna. The bandits had threatened to hold them as long as they wished if the government failed to meet their demands.
