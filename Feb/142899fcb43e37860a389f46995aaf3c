The All Progressives Congress (APC) has insisted President Muhammadu Buhari is in control of security in Nigeria. The party advised Nigerians to shun the “crass, wild and baseless statement” issued by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in response to the abduction of schoolchildren in Niger State. John Udoedehe, National Secretary, APC Caretaker Committee, said the opposition shouldn’t be taken seriously on any issue. “We cannot join issues with the PDP but rather focus on ongoing efforts to ensure the quick and safe release of the abducted schoolchildren and other citizens. “Coordinated by our service chiefs, President Muhammadu Buhari has already deployed to Niger State national security assets to achieve this. “We urge parents, loved ones and other stakeholders not to be distracted by the PDP’s insensitive, horribly-timed and baseless conspiracies and lies as all hands are on deck to ensure the quick and safe release of the abductees.” The scribe added that the government’s resolve and the capacity of security services to end attacks on soft targets is not in doubt.
