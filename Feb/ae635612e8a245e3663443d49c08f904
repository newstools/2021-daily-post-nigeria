Residents and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Dikwa, Borno State, showered soldiers with praises and prayers on Saturday. This followed the Nigerian military battle with Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters Friday evening. The troops restored order in Dikwa after foiling terrorists’ attempt to breach security and peace in the area. The General Officer Commanding 7 Division, Maj Gen Abdul Khalifa visited the town to oversee the situation. Khalifa, received by the joyous residents, told them he was excited many people were returning to their homes. He noted that swift reinforcement ensured troops successfully dislodged the terrorists and took control. Khalifa disclosed that investigations are underway to unravel the circumstances surrounding the ambush. “Lots of soldiers and other military equipment have been brought to reinforce the general area. “The Nigerian Army would continue to protect all civilians wherever they are. They should report suspicious people and movements to the troops”, the GOC said.
