Paris Saint-Germain boss, Mauricio Pochettino, has revealed that his forward, Kylian Mbappe, told him that he (Pochettino) would win at Camp Nou for the second time of his managerial career. Pochettino disclosed this after PSG defeated Barcelona 4-1 in the Champions League round of 16 first-leg tie on Tuesday night, thanks to a hat-trick from Mbappe and a strike from Moise Kean. “Great footballers create their own path, and those three goals have put him in the media spotlight,” Pochettino told a post-match press conference. “We had no doubts, and we are very happy for him [Mbappe]. “Confidence always has to be absolute, and he felt calm [before the game]. “He asked me yesterday in training: ‘How many times have you won at Camp Nou?’ I told him once. He answered: ‘Tomorrow, it will be twice.’ That’s why he’s a top player.”
