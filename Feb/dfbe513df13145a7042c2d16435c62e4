The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has berated the Senate for confirming former Service Chiefs as non-career Ambassador-Designates. PDP said the confirmation would not stop the International Criminal Court, ICC, from investigating and prosecuting the former Service Chiefs. The former ruling party stated this in a series of tweets on its official Twitter handle, on Tuesday. “The @OfficialPDPNig berates the @OfficialAPCNg leadership in the
@NGRSenate for betraying Nigerians by clearing the former services chiefs for ambassadorial portfolios despite reports of crime against humanity committed under their command. “The party however insisted that the clearance will not stop the investigation and possible prosecution of the accused commanders by the @IntlCrimCourt for crime against humanity, which preliminary steps have already commenced by the ICC.” The Senate had on Tuesday confirmed the former Service Chiefs as Nigerian Envoy. This followed Buhari’s nomination of the former Service Chiefs as envoy. Service Chiefs confirmed include: Retired Defense Chief Abayomi Olonisakin, former Army Chief Tukur Buratai, former Navy Chief Ibok-Ete Ekwe Ibas and former Air Chief Sadique Abubakar.
