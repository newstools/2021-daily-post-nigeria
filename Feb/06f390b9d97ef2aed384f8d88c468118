A housewife, Martha Ojo, has prayed a Customary Court in Jikwoyi, FCT, to grant the request of her husband, Moses. Martha said he had concluded plans to secretly marry his sales girl. Moses had filed a divorce petition against Martha before the court, NAN reports. The respondent explained that she was unable to attend the last sitting due to her trip to Jos. “My husband is a grade one lair. I was unable to come for the court sitting, my husband came to court and told a lie against me. “He told the court that I went to meet my lover and that I was planning a wedding. I have it on record that he is the one planning a secret wedding.” Martha stated that she was fed up with the marriage. “Please grant him his prayer, let him go and marry his salesgirl,” she said. Martha revealed Moses had already thrown her things out of the house. She, however, begged the court to grant her custody of the children. The judge, Jemilu Jega, will deliver judgment on March 9.
