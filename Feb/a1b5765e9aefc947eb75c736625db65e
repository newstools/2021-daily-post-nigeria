The United States on Friday declared support for the emergence of Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the next Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The announcement by the office of the US Trade Representative followed the decision by the Republic of Korea’s Trade Minister, Yoo Myung-hee to end her candidacy. The statement expressed President Joe Biden administration’s strong support for Nigeria’s former Finance Minister. It recognised Okonjo-Iweala’s knowledge in economics and international diplomacy from her 25 years with the World Bank. “She is widely respected for her effective leadership and has proven experience managing a large international organization with a diverse membership”, it read. The U.S. government hailed Myung-hee, South Korea’s first female Trade Minister, for her campaign for the position and her withdrawal. America underscored that two highly qualified women made it to the final round of consideration, the first time in history that any woman made it to the stage. “The United States stands ready to engage in the next phase of the WTO process for reaching a consensus decision on the WTO Director General”, the statement added.
