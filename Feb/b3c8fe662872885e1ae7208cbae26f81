Hannibal Brumskine III, the founder of TheMusicBusiness.com and second-generation Liberian American, newly launched startup is a music entrepreneurship program for young independent musicians. The initiative is for West African and American youths with promising musical talent, who need support and guidance to actualize their goals and projects. Buhari in his new year message promised that he would secure the future of ”our youths” stating, “Nigerian youth ingenuity, creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit is evident to all. Many of our young people are excelling in various spheres of life including entertainment”. Brumskine III promised to align himself with this message from the president by creating an environment that enables ”our youth to pursue entertainment in a more systemized manner.” Leaders and representatives have said that the incessant cases of banditry, robbery, kidnapping and killings being perpetrated by the youth would be halted if leaders could place priority on the empowerment of youths through vocational, entrepreneurial, and entertainment training. Brumskine III believes that with the disturbing and frightening height of unemployment in the country, the truth of exposing people to business and entertainment opportunities has become beneficial and stands out amongst other things as one of the top ways to occupy youth and rescue them out of the current vicious poverty level.
