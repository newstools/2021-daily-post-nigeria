Tottenham manager, Jose Mourinho, has reacted to the Europa league last 16 draw that pitted his side against Dinamo Zagreb. Tottenham was lucky to have avoided Manchester United and Arsenal in the draw and Mourinho believes that at this stage there is no easy team left in the competition. Addressing the press on Friday after the draws were confirmed, Mourinho said, “When you are in this competition and you get to this stage you don’t get easy clubs. If you want to win it, sooner or later you have to play against the best clubs or the ones who go through the different stages.” The Portuguese said his team’s objective at the moment is to win against Dinamo and prepare to meet Arsenal and Manchester United later in the competition, adding, “we have always had to face them. “I think, yeah it happened in the Champions League final, two English clubs, happened in the Europa League with Arsenal and Chelsea too. “It’s something that can happen and if it does, wonderful for us if we are one of the two teams and wonderful for English football to have two teams in the final. “But at this moment 16 teams, everybody wants the same so it’s very premature to think about it. Dinamo, they beat Krasnodar twice. “I played against them with Real Madrid in the Champions League. Croatian football is Croatian football, with lots of talent. It’s a football country.”
