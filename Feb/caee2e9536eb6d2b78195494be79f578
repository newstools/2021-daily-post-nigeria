The Nigerian Army has reacted to the alleged murder on the order of immediate-past Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai. It stated that the Nigerian military does not secretly try erring personnel and officers. The reaction followed Tuesday reports of execution of six “Igbo Christian soldiers”. They were allegedly eliminated on 25 January 2021 after being denied of legal representation. In a press statement, a coalition of human rights activists from South-East had said the soldiers were attached to the Armoury Department of the Nigerian Army in Abacha Barracks, Abuja. The activists listed the names of the personnel: Prince Ukwuoma, son of a traditional ruler; Ebube Isaiah, Amos Azubuike, Ekene Ebere, Moses Anyim and Godwin Uchendu. In a chat with PRNigeria Tuesday night, a senior military intelligence officer described the claim as false and malicious. He said a general court-martial set up to prosecute soldiers or Army officers is normally constituted and announced publicly. The officer noted that the Army court must have a President and other members, who conduct trial publicly. “Which court-martial are they referring to? When was it constituted? Who was the President and who were the other members of the court-martial? Where were the six soldiers executed? Can they show us their graves? “There is no secret trial in the military, in general. If secret trials were not conducted by the Army for its erring soldiers and officers during military regimes, how then can that be possible now, under a democratic rule? “We have witnessed instances where even erring Army general have been publicly tried at various court-martials, which were also legally constituted. So, why should a secret trial be held for ‘ordinary’ soldiers,” he said.
