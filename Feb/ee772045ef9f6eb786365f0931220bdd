The National Drug Law Law Enforcement Agency, (NDLEA) Jigawa Command, said it has arrested 36 suspects from three Local Government Areas of the State. Hajiya Maryam Gambo, the agency’s Commander, in a statement on Friday, said that the suspects were arrested between Feb. 15 and Feb. 27, in Kirikasamma, Guri and Hadejia LGAs. Gambo said the arrests were made in markets, shops and other hideouts, in a determined effort to rid the state of illegal sale and consumption of hard drugs. She explained that different types of hard drugs, ranging from cannabis sativa (hemp) and psychotropic substances were recovered from the suspects. According to her, the illicit drugs recovered from the suspects are Tramadol, Exol15, Diszepam, Prometazine injection and Lidocaine injection. “In our effort to cleanse Jigawa of illegal consumption and sale of hard drugs, the NDLEA Jigawa command embarked on a mission in Kirikasamma, Guri, Hadejia and other parts of the state to clamp on illicit drug activities. “This is done in order to reduce crimes and criminality, which are drug induced in the state. “Drug is an agent provocateur of other crimes as it negatively changes the mood of the user. “The user, consequently, embarks on a mission he/she would not have dared to, under his normal senses,’’ she added.
