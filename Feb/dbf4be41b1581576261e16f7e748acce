Chelsea defender, Andreas Christensen, has revealed some of the changes Thomas Tuchel has implemented since he replaced Frank Lampard, to make the Blues watertight at the back. In Tuchel’s first six matches in charge at Stamford Bridge, his side had conceded only once. That record stands in stark contrast to the one that contributed to Lampard’s sack. Christensen has now given an analysis of how the German wants the Blues to play now. “If you don’t need to play the ball, you don’t have to,” Christensen told Chelsea’s official website on the message from Tuchel. “Wait for someone to come and take the ball, don’t take last-second decisions, know what you’re going to do and make it happen. “He just said to us to be comfortable and believe in ourselves. I have played in the middle of the three before and I’m quite comfortable there.”
