Chelsea’s assistant coach, Zsolt Low, has said that the club’s manager, Thomas Tuchel and his staff are aiming for a top-four finish in the Premier League in their first season at Stamford Bridge. Low, who worked with Tuchel during their time at Paris Saint-Germain, said this ahead of Chelsea’s FA Cup fifth-round tie with Barnsley on Thursday night. Chelsea was expected to challenge for the Premier League title this season but was ninth position on the Premier League table when Frank Lampard was sacked last month and replaced by Tuchel. However, Tuchel’s men are currently in the fifth position on the log with 39 points from 23 games. Speaking to M1 in his native Hungary, Low said: “We didn’t arrive with the goal of winning the [Premier League] title in these few months. “It would be a brilliant performance to be able to finish in the top four, which the club would be happy with. “It’s amazingly difficult to win against any team, not only to be prepared against sensational players, but the very best coaches are also working in the Premier League.”
