Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami has denied report of his 2023 governorship campaign posters in Kebbi State. A statement by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr Umar Jibrilu-Gwandu in Birnin Kebbi on Friday, said report indicating that the minister’s 2023 campaign posters had flooded streets across the State was false. “Our attention has been drawn to the fictitious, mischievous report claiming that the posters of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice vying for the 2023 governorship poll have flooded everywhere in the state. “We have gone round the city with journalists; they have seen it by themselves that the report lacked iota of truth. We have not seen any of such posters in Birnin Kebbi. “We, therefore, want the general public to disregard such information because it was just the figment of imagination of the author,” he said. He reiterated that it was not yet time for political campaigns.
