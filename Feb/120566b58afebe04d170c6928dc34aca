Former Liverpool defender, Jamie Carragher, has identified Edouard Mendy as a better goalkeeper for Chelsea ahead of Kepa Arrizabalaga. Carragher disclosed this on Monday as Kepa started ahead of Mendy in Chelsea’s 2-0 victory against Newcastle United in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge. Kepa, who Chelsea signed for £72million in 2018 from Athletic Bilbao, has played second fiddle to the Blues’ summer signing, Mendy, for much of the season. However, Tuchel handed Kepa his first Premier League start since last October on Monday night as Chelsea defeated Newcastle at home, thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and Timo Werner. Comparing both goalkeepers, Carragher told Sky Sports: “Mendy is a better goalkeeper – we have seen that since he came in – but he’s not as good with his feet as Kepa. “I think the manager wants to have a look, but I also think the hierarchy are asking whether Tuchel can get something out of Kepa. I don’t expect it to last too long.” Chelsea’s next game is against Southampton on Saturday in an away Premier League tie.
