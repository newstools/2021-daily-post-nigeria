The Bauchi State Hisbah Command said it confiscated 260 crates of alcoholic drinks from hotels and night clubs. Malam Aminu Balarabe Isah, the Permanent Commissioner in charge of Hisbah and Sharia implementation, who disclosed this to newsmen on Tuesday, said it was part of its effort to enforce Sharia Islamic code. He said 216 crates were confiscated in Misau local government area and 44 in Bauchi club and some beer parlours located in Dass park in Bauchi metropolis. “We will continue to conduct our search to fish out perpetrators of such misdemeanors. “We will also be seeking for a court order to destroy the items as the subsisting Sharia law implemented in 2003 prohibits sales and consumption of alcoholic drinks. “No fewer than six operators of beer parlours were also arrested during the patrol and they would soon be prosecuted to serve as a deterrent to others,” he said. He however urged the state government to hasten the appointment of the state Hisbah Board, as well as provide additional financial support to the department.
