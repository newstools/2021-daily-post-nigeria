The All Progressives Congress (APC) has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari’s appointment of Abdulrasheed Bawa as Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The party advised Bawa to invest in technology and liaise with key partners locally and internationally. John Akpan Udoedehe, APC National Secretary, in a statement on Thursday urged Bawa to be guided by the President’s stance that the fight against corruption must be total and unsparing. “To be steps ahead, the Abdulrasheed Bawa-led EFCC must invest in technology and ensure synergy, cooperation and partnership with relevant agencies, locally and internationally”, he counselled. APC said Bawa’s 16 years of work experience and in different strategic capacities at the EFCC has prepared him for the job. “Drawing from a pool of well-trained staff can only increase professionalism through reliance on institutional memory and also boost staff morale, as in the case of Abdulrasheed Bawa’s appointment.” Udoedehe noted that Bawa’s age was an advantage and an indication that the present administration believes in its youth population. APC said advance fee fraud, money laundering, public sector corruption and other financial crime-related issues, are becoming increasingly sophisticated. The ruling party described corruption as the root cause of most societal problems, assuring that the current administration is working assiduously to reverse such trends.
