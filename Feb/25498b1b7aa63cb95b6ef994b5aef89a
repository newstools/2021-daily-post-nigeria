Former governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, have promised to look into the crisis rocking the party, which had led to the defection of many members. The ex-governors made the promise on Wednesday while meeting with the Saraki-led Reconciliation and Strategy Committee established to end the party’s crisis. DAILY POST had earlier reported that the committee members, chaired by the former Senate President, Bukola Saraki were in close door meeting with the PDP ex-governors. Saraki, while addressing newsmen shortly after the meeting, said: “Former Governors that have been elected under the platform of the PDP, they promised the members of the #PDPReconciliation & Strategy Committee that moving forward they will be more active in the affairs of the party at all levels. “You know our former governors are still stakeholders in the party, “There is no way we can embark on reconciliation of the party without consulting them. “We have been here now for over two to three hours on this crucial and productive meeting. “They have all shown their commitment to the party and promised to make sure the party is well prepared for the 2023 general elections”.
