The Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku has asked the Federal government to allow Nigerians to carry licenced guns to defend themselves as the surge in insecurity in the country continues. Speaking after receiving the 15 local government chairmen of the state in his office, the Governor said the Federal government has to restrategize in order to curtail the level of insecurity in the country. “The security in this country has gone to the lowest ebb and we have to all wake-up. “We as leaders have given our advice severally as to the change to the security architecture, but the Federal government cannot keep doing the same thing over and over and expect a different result. “If we cannot be able to provide security for our citizens, then allow all the citizens to buy AK-47 because if everybody is licensed with AK-47, nobody will have the guts to invade any home. “In a situation where we are all gagged with one security system that has been unable to work, and we are told to sit down and be counting the day our turn will come, I honestly do not agree with it,” he said.
