The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has condemned the alleged brutality against people who protested at the Lekki tollgate on Saturday, February 13, 2021. Sanwo-Olu has now directed the State’s Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, to open an investigation into the incident. Lagos Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotosho, confirmed this at a joint briefing by the state government and the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) in Lagos on Monday. Omotosho insisted that Sanwo-Olu’s administration would never trample on the rights of residents. Also, the Managing Director of Lekki Concession Company (LCC), Yomi Omomuwasan, spoke on alleged use of the firm’s operational vehicle to convey protesters at the tollgate. Omomuwasan explained that the vehicle was donated to the police to assist them as a logistical support. He also said the request to reopen the tollgate from the judicial panel of inquiry, was because the firm needs to carry out an assessment of valuables that were lost to the October 20, 2020 violent protest with the aim of getting the necessary insurance cover. Omomuwasan insisted the reopening was not to immediately start tolling on the facilities. The MD of the LCC also stressed that an estimated N2.5bn worth of assets were lost during the protest. “As of 2011, we had N24 billion owned by local lenders and N49 billion borrowed from the International Development Bank. “We need to bring a formal report of assessment of the damage back to our lenders because when you don’t pay, you are blacklisted. The claims could be verified. Assets would require a team of engineers both within and outside to do critical assessment. “We need to do civil and electrical works, which cannot be completed within three months,” Omomuwasan added.
