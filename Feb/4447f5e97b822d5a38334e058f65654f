Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has said they deserved more from their Copa del Rey defeat to Sevilla. Jules Kounde and Ivan Rakitic scored as Sevilla won the first leg of the semi-final 2-0 on Wednesday night. Koeman felt they should have been awarded a penalty at 1-0 down, when Jordi Alba was tripped on the edge of the area. But referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz gave a free-kick without checking with the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) whether the foul was committed inside the box. “Everyone has told me it was a penalty,” Koeman said. “They made a lot of fouls but clever fouls and they defended very well. I think we deserved more, we played well and created a lot of chances. I think it’s a harsh result for us given what we did on the pitch.” The second leg will be played at the Camp Nou on March 3.
