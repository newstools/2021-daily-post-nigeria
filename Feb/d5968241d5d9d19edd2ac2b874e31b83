Tottenham Hotspur boss, Jose Mourinho, has slammed his players for the “mistakes” that led to a 5-4 defeat at Everton in the FA Cup fourth round. Spurs got off to a fine start, when Davinson Sanchez headed in the opener in the third minute. However, the hosts replied with three goals from Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurddson. Erik Lamela and Sanchez made it 3-3, before Harry Kane cancelled out Richarlison’s second. But it was Bernard that had the final word with the decisive strike in extra time. “We had the ball; we created, we had great movement, scored goals. “Great character to fight against but goals only win games if you don’t make so many mistakes. “We were the best team, winning 1-0; then in five minutes it was mistake, mistake, mistake; goal, goal, goal,” Mourinho said afterwards.
