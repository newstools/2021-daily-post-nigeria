Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has promised to “protect” forward, Bukayo Saka, ahead of their Premier League clash with Manchester City on Sunday at Emirates. Arteta wants to support Saka, give him the best possible advice all the time and manage his minutes so he can maintain his level for the Gunners. The Spaniard also hailed the consistency of Saka after the 19-year-old scored a goal in Arsenal’s Europa League round of 32 first-leg 1-1 draw against Benfica on Thursday in Rome. “I think he [Saka] is in a great moment,” Arteta said at a post-match press conference after Arsenal’s draw with Benfica. “He is full of confidence, he has been really important in the recent results, his form is the highest probably that it has been since I’ve been here and he has been really consistent. “He needs to keep going and doing what he is doing because, at the moment, he is a big part of the team.” Arteta added: “I think that we have to protect him and keep the expectations where they should be. “But I am not going to put a break in his development or how much he can do week in, week out. “We have to support him, give him the best possible advice all the time and manage his minutes so he can maintain his level. “He has been a real threat, he is involved in a lot of goals all the time, and the consistency of his performances makes him a starter obviously, it’s a fine balance, but at the same time he is 19 years old, so we have to protect him.”
