Mikel Arteta has hailed his Arsenal side following their 3-1 win over Leicester City on Sunday. Leicester took the lead early on at the King Power Stadium after Youri Tielemans fired the home side ahead with a clinical finish after some poor defending from Arsenal. But goals from David Luiz, Alexandre Lacazette’s penalty and Nicolas Pepe ensured that Mikel Arteta’s went home with all 3 points. Addressing the press after the win that brought the Gunners into the top half of the table, Arteta said “I’m really proud of the team, the character we showed.” Giving reasons for the win, the Spaniard added, “We looked composed, confident, the energy and the positiveness around the team was really good.” Also reacting to the victory, Lacazette, who netted from the spot, said, “We know it’s important to finish well. I think these two wins are going to give us a lot of confidence for the team. It’s good for the spirit, the mood and everything. “Today we really wanted to win and we did it well I think. The reaction after the goal we conceded, everyone kept the focus and stayed with the gameplan. When everyone is like this it’s easier to win games.”
