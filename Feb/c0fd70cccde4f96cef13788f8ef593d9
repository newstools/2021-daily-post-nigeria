The Ebonyi State Government, on Thursday, said it has constituted a judicial commission of inquiry into the recent Effium, Ezza-Effium communal crisis. Recall that the recent clashes between the two communities had claimed many lives and property worth millions of naira. The Commissioner for Information and Orientation in the state, Mr Uchenna Orji, stated this while addressing newsmen in Abakaliki, the state capital. The Commissioner said that renowned jurist, Justice Omaka Elekwa, heads the eight-member commission, with members drawn from the traditional and religious institutions, among other areas. “The executive council sought an unbiased commission, which members would have no interest or relationship with the unfortunate incident. “The commission’s members have proven themselves in their various fields of endeavour and are trusted to do a dispassionate job,” he said. Orji, who noted that the commission was given 30 days to submit their findings, said their terms of reference included determining the immediate and remote causes of the crisis. He said: “The commission should also determine the extent of damage to lives and property, including those directly and indirectly involved in the crisis. “The commission would recommend measures to be taken by the government to restore normalcy and forestall a recurrence, while making other recommendations for lasting peace in the area. The commissioner said that the government was not aware of the purported removal of the Chairman of Ohaukwu Local Government Area, where the warring community belongs. “The outcome of the commission’s inquiry would have nothing to do with the chairman’s stay in office and the public are advised to disregard the rumours. “Political office holders in general should assist the government in ensuring peace in their communities and provide information to forestall crisis.
