Dino Melaye, former Kogi lawmaker has called for a national day of prayer over the situation of Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari. Melaye, in a video on his Instagram page, said the spirit of failure has befallen President Buhari and APC governors. The former lawmaker warned that something catastrophic will happen if Nigerians do not gather to pray against it. “We need to have a national day of prayer. “I’m not saying this to scare but for those who are in the spirit will understand that if we continue to allow this spirit of failure to operate something catastrophic will happen. “The spirit of perpetual error has fallen on president Buhari and APC led governors. Every hour a monumental colossal error is committed and it is becoming a tradition. “It is very dangerous and I call for a day for national prayer “We are on the edge; we need a national day of prayer to salvage our country as the spirit of error has taken over Aso Rock. They don’t know it or understand it.” Melaye urged Buhari to take Nigeria back to how he met it before he assumed power in 2015, insinuating that it was better than now. “This is not the country of our dreams. We are not asking for improvements. Buhari should take us back to where he picked us from in 2015 where a loaf of bread was N120. Take us back to where you took us from,” he added.
