Veteran rapper, Ruggedman has shared why he ‘disembarked’ on his journey of becoming an actor in Nollywood. The rapper who made the disclosure in a post via his Twitter account on Saturday said he found out that men in the industry weren’t progressing like the women. He also wondered why the male actors are left behind while the female actors are the ones buying cars and building houses. According to him, the turnout of events discouraged him from pursuing a career in acting. “My male actors in Nollywood, what’s going on? It’s just the females that are buying cars and building houses left and right. “I wanted to pursue a career in acting but honestly, at this rate, I don’t think I’m still interested,” he said.
