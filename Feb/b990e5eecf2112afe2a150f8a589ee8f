The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has smashed a credit card fraud syndicate. The suspects are Daniel C. Stephen, Nestor Ezeani, Sonny Okwaraji, Sylvester E. Otuwa and Jeff Ogbonnaya. They allegedly masterminded the theft of $257,822.16 from a new generation bank, a statement by EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren said. In a petition, the bank said it received a mail from VISA International on suspected 60 credit card transactions. Operatives moved in and arrested the five suspects at 7th Avenue in FESTAC, Lagos. They were caught with several credit cards which they use in loading money before transfer to other banks. Uwujaren said some of the suspects already made useful statements. Investigations continue and all will be charged to court upon conclusion.
