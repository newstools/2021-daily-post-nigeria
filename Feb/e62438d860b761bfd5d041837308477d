A battle between Boko Haram, Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) left many fighters of the latter dead. The gun duel occurred at the border town between Nigeria and the Niger Republic. Al Thabat, an al-Qaida affiliated media outfit confirmed the face-off. In a statement, Al Thabat said Jama’at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da’wah wa’l-Jihad, popularly known as Boko Haram, eliminated ISWAP members at Sunawa village. BBC reported that ISWAP had abducted dozens of women linked to Boko Haram. The factional sect consequently attacked an ISWAP base and rescued the captives. ISWAP was formed after several commanders and fighters dumped the Shekau led Boko Haram in 2016. Recently, the Shura (consultation) Council of ISWAP appointed Abu Dawud as new leader. Dawud’s elevation followed a coup d’etat which overthrew Amir Abba-Gana. Abba-Gana had emerged after the execution of Ba’a Idirisa on February 9, 2019. The deceased succeeded Abu-Mossad Albarnawee. Idirisa and Albarnawee are biological children of the late Boko Haram founder, Mohammed Yusuf.
