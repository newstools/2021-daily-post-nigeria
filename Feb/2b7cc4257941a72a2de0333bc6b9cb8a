The second reading of a motion to stop casualisation of Nigerian workers has been passed by the Nigeria Senate during Thursday’s sitting. The motion which was sponsored by Senator Akinyelure Patrick representing Ondo Central Senatorial district called for the end and prohibition of workers casualisation in the public and private sectors. “A bill for an act to provide for the prohibition of casualisation in all forms of employment in the private and public sectors in Nigeria and other related matters.” In his lead debate, the lawmaker regretted how Nigerians have been taken advantage of in the guise of casual staff, insisting that the Nigerian Senate must intervene to stop the anomaly. According to him, some foreign and local companies which have the financial wherewithal to provide gainful employment insists on casualisation because it is cost-effective. The lawmaker regretted that foreign companies indulge in the casualisation of Nigerian workers, something they can not do in their country of origin.
Supporting the bill, Senator Barau Jibril said “We must make a law that will stop casualization of workers in this country. “I support the bill and urge my colleagues to do the same to protect our workforce. Senator Jibril stressed further that Nigeria needs to make laws that will protect citizens especially the young people. Senator Michael Bamidele Opeyemi on his part, said some of the issues raised were provided in the Labour law, noting that the Senate has to take a drastic action towards its implementation. Other lawmakers who threw their weight behind the motion before its referral are, Deputy senate president, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, Senator Sani Musa, Senator Ajibola Bashiru, Senator Biodun Olujimi. Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan referred the motion to the Senate Committee on Labour, Employment and Productivity to revert in four weeks.
