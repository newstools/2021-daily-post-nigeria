A 19-year-old student of Oduduwa College, Ile-Ife, Osun State has been detained at the State Command Headquarters of the Nigeria Police, Osogbo for beating the Principal of the school, Mr. Ademola Sanusi, to coma. A statement obtained by DAILY POST said reasons for the studentsâ€™ action was not yet known. DAILY POST learned that the 19-year-old student in collaboration with his gang members subjected the Principal to repeated punching in the premises of the school. Reacting to the incident, the Osun State Commissioner for Education, Folorunso Oladoyin said it was totally condemnable, sickening, disturbing and disheartening that a student of a public secondary school could be involved in such a morally absurd behavioural conduct. While describing students of public schools in Osun as disciplined, cultured and well behaved, the Commissioner maintained that the 19-year-old culprit and his gangsters will not go unpunished no matter what it took. The Commissioner who expressed gladness that decency and discipline were on a daily basis gaining momentum in all public schools explained that the administration of Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola will not compromise standards. Oladoyin warned that such incidents will not in any form or manner be tolerated henceforth in all Osun public or private schools. He reiterated the resolve of the state government to make scapegoats of any student caught in any act of indiscipline by being made to face the full wrath of the law. The Education Commissioner counselled students on the need to face their studies squarely rather than engaging in truancy and hooliganism and appealed to parents and guardians to keep tabs on the activities of their children and wards before and after school hours. Meanwhile, the detention of the teenager by the Nigerian Police is pending the completion of necessary investigations into the matter by the police authority.
