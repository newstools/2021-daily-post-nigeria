Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has said the federal government constituted by the All Progressives Congress (APC) has done so badly that Nigerians will not make the mistake of returning it to power in 2023. He stated this during a visit to his Adamawa State counterpart, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri on Thursday. “PDP states are doing very well and some are angry. Let them show what they are doing instead of being angry,” Wike said. He boasted that the PDP would take over government at the federal level come 2023 because APC has proved itself to be a failure and Nigerians would not make the mistake of returning it to power.  Wike made the boasts to newsmen after inspecting some projects being executed by his host Governor Fintiri, particularly the two flyover bridges under construction around the state capital, Yola. The governor had expressed the surprise that so much could be done in an apparently resource-scarce state like Adamawa. “I am shocked. I am overwhelmed by what I have seen,” Wike said during an interview with newsmen after touring the second of two flyovers under construction upon his arrival in Yola. Fintiri, who received Wike at the International Airport, Yola, had immediately taken the visiting governor to the nearby flyover site around the city’s main market called Total Junction, after which the convoy toured the second flyover site at the part of Yola famously called Police Roundabout. Wike, who rode round the project sites with Fintiri, told the newsmen further, “I was asking him (Fintiri) where he got the money to do these projects. To say he has done well is an understatement. He has done exceedingly well.”
