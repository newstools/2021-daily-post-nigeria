The Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency (LASCOPA) on Thursday, shut down the Home Affairs Supermarket for allegedly selling expired products. The General Manager of LASCOPA, Afolabi Solebo Esq, who made this known in a tweet via its official Twitter account, said that the supermarket located at 21, Ijaye Road, Ogba was sealed for displaying expired products on their shelves for possible sale to unsuspecting consumers. He noted that despite several public enlightenment campaigns and warnings by LASCOPA, store managers still sold expired products which were harmful to human health. “I personally, discovered the expired items on the supermarket shelves on the 23rd of February, 2021, while on a routine check of supermarkets in the area. “On discovering the expired products, I told the staff to remove the items from the shelves, which they did in my presence. “However, the monitoring and enforcement team got there the following day and discovered that the items have been returned to the promo shelf,” he said He further noted that the Agency had to seal Home Affairs Supermarket in the interest of the general consumers in the State. Solebo also urged consumers not to hesitate to report any supermarket or shops within the State where expired products are sold. He advised residents to always submit their complaints free of charge by visiting the office of LASCOPA at 2b, Soji Adepegba Close, off Allen Avenue, Ikeja or send correspondence to the Agency’s e-mail addresses: lascopa@lagosstate.gov.ng and lascopa@gmail.com for necessary action.
