Hunters and members of vigilance groups repelled an attack by Boko Haram on Friday in Borno State. Some of the insurgents, who attacked motorists, were eliminated during a gun duel at Modu Kellu and Burembe communities. A resident told PRNigeria that Boko Haram members on about ten motorcycles ambushed travellers on a road that stretches through the villages. The hunters and vigilantes mobilized after they got the information and stormed the scene along Maiduguri-Magumeri highway. The security team was led by one Mallam Aisami. Six motorcycles and weapons, belonging to the terrorists, were recovered. After overpowering the attackers, the local fighters took the bodies and motorcycles to Magumeri. They are expected to brief government security agencies. Hunters, vigilantes and Civilian JTF personnel have been playing a complimentary role in the war against insurgency. They sometimes fight alongside the military. On Thursday, Governor Babagana Zulum ordered a special medical treatment for nine CJTF members attacked by Boko Haram. They sustained serious injuries in a battle with terrorists during the recent Dikwa invasion.
