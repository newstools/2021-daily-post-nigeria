The Presidency, on Monday, said President Muhammadu Buhari did not violate any COVID-19 protocols in Daura, Katsina State over the weekend. DAILY POST had reported that the President violated the Health Protection Regulation Order he signed last week. The President was seen at the revalidation of his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Daura, Katsina State at different times without a face mask amidst scores of people. Although the Nigerian leader had his mask on at some points, it was also observed that he failed to maintain physical distance as stipulated by the newly signed Coronavirus Disease Health Protection Regulations (2021). This resulted in a backlash from the Peoples Democratic Party and Nigerians on social media who slammed him for breaking the same laws he made. Reacting, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, during an interview on Channel TV defended the President’s decision to remove his face mask in public. He also stated that Buhari had his mask on during the exercise but only removed it when he spoke to the microphone. “People are missing the point. The President had his face mask on through that engagement. He had it off when he was speaking into the microphone. It is just a childish antic by the PDP.”
