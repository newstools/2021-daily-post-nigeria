Mino Raiola, agent to Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has promised not to address his client’s future at Old Trafford after the player was linked with a return to Juventus. Reports had emerged in Italy that Juventus are preparing a move for Pogba at the end of the 2020/21 season. Pogba has less than 18 months left on his current deal with Man United and Raiola had said publicly in December that the France World Cup winner will not sign an extension. However, when asked about Pogba’s potential move to Juventus this summer, Raiola told reporters on Thursday that he doesn’t want to talk about the 27-year-old’s future because people get nervous and don’t sleep at night. “Pogba must also be left alone. When I speak, people get nervous, they don’t sleep at night, so I don’t speak anymore,” Raiola said. “I will do what I have to do not in front of you, but in the shadows, as I have always done.” Pogba is currently sidelined with a thigh-muscle injury.
