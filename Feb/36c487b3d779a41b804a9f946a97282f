The Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Ari Muhammed Ali on Wednesday said cultism and kidnappings was a major challenge in Warri and its environs. The Police boss made the assertion when he paid a working visit to the Warri Area Command. He said the Police cannot fight the menace alone just as he stressed the need for members of the community to partner security agencies in the fight against the monsters causing serious havoc in the society. According to CP Ali, “A suspect was arrested for kidnapping, murder and armed robbery and for collecting ransom. He said, Oga, we cannot do anything without the consent of the people of the area.” CP Ali noted that there are internal collaborators with criminals around the various communities and that’s why cultism and kidnappings thrive in the society. He urged the traditional rulers, youth leaders and caregivers to collaborate with the police in the fight against cultism and kidnapping. CP Ali who was flanked by DCP Sunday Faleye, CSP Graham Imadeh, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya and others said he will ensure that the rights of the people are not abused. He warned that no Policeman will kill anybody and blame it on “accidental discharge”. You must know how to handle your firearm.
