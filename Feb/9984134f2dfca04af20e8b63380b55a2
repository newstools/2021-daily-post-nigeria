Bruno Fernandes has said that his team-mate, Daniel James’ assist in Manchester United 4-0 win against Real Sociedad on Thursday was accidental. Fernandes netted twice with James and Rashford also finding the net as United recorded a comfortable lead in the Europa League last-32 tie. The midfielder’s second strike came as he took the ball from James and sent it beyond goalkeeper, Alex Remiro. The Portuguese said he doubts that James intended to put the ball in his path, but credited him with the assist regardless. “I was expecting the touch from Dan James to me. When he controlled the ball. I think he was trying to control it, but I’ll give him an assist,” he told BT Sport. “I saw the ball close to me and I think on these occasions, the keeper is coming out, if you kick it well on the first touch, it’s difficult to react and luckily for me, it was a goal.” Despite their four goals advantage, Fernandes admitted that Manchester United cannot afford to be complacent as they look to finish the season with a trophy.
