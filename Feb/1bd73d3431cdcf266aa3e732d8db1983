Inter Milan striker, Romelu Lukaku, has named Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba, as his ‘idol’ in football. Lukaku, also named Manchester City legend, Vincent Kompany, has the best defender he has ever come across in his glittering career. The 27-year-old said this on Tuesday evening during a Question & Answer session with fans on his official Twitter page, @RomeluLukaku9. Lukaku, who netted a goal in Inter’s 3-0 win over AC Milan last Sunday, has scored 17 goals in the Serie A for Antonio Conte’s side so far this season. The Belgium international is currently behind Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, who has netted 18 goals for Andrea Pirlo’s men. Lukaku will now hope to lead Inter to victory when they host Genoa in the Serie A this weekend.
