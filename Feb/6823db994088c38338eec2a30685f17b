Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has expressed confidence that captain Ahmed Musa will find a new club soon, after his proposed move to West Brom fell through. Musa is currently a free agent, after leaving Saudi club Al Nassr in October 2020. After visiting the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos ahead of next month’s 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Benin and Lesotho, Rohr assured that the 28-year-old will be back to his best soon. “It’s unfortunate it didn’t work out at West Brom, but I believe Musa will find another club soon,” Rohr told BBC Sport Africa. “He has the ambition to get back as quickly as he can to play football again at club level. “Musa made a great impact for us in big matches like against Iceland in Russia, that is a reminder of the ability he has. “I have no doubt he can discover his best form, the happiness and joy to play again. This will be good for us because we can get to see that impact in our squad.”
