Former Swedish International and Milan star Zlatan Ibrahimovic has named Brazil legend Ronaldo as ‘the best player in history’. Ibrahimovic expressed his admiration towards the former Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSV, Inter and AC Milan star. He put the World Cup winner ahead Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo who are believed to be the greatest of all time. Ibrahimovic, 39, believes Ronaldo Nazario, who led Brazil to World Cup glory in 2002, transcended the game of football with his unique talents. Speaking with Discovery Plus, Ibrahimovic who has won over 30 trophies, said, “I don’t need to describe Ronaldo, ‘The Phenomenon’. “I always say you have the players that play the game, and the players that are the game. “For me, Ronaldo is the game. When you watch him play, everyone wanted to play like him and become like him. “The way he was moving, the way he did his stepovers, the way he did ‘the snake’. The way he was moving, for me he’s the greatest player through history, no doubt.” Ronaldo scored 296 career goals in 452 matches in total, and won three FIFA World Player of the Year awards and two Ballon d’Or. His first Ballon d’Or was historic as the youngest player to have won at 21.
