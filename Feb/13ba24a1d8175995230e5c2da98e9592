The prosecutor, Jacob Akintunde, told the court that the defendants committed the offence on February 3, 2021, at Oyebode farm in Abudo Village, Ede, Osun state. He told the court that Rafiu, when the owner of the poultry was not around invited the 1st defendant, Saheed, who had been sacked from the poultry to carry out the operation. The prosecutor further stated that the stolen bags of maize were found in the defendants’ house. He said that the first accused person was a driver in the organization, while the second defendant was a worker in the poultry. According to the charger sheet, the offence is contrary to section 516,39(9) of criminal code Cap 34 vol 2 law of Osun state, 2003. Meanwhile, the defendants pleaded guilty to the court charger levelled against them by the police.
