Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) has been in the news for 24 hours over a sex tape. It is still unclear if any or all the three individuals in the viral footage attend the school. DAILY POST gathered that the management of the institution, located in Ogbomoso, has commenced a probe. In a video of an unspecified time of recording, the girl in the tape declared she was a prostitute. “I don’t know you, you don’t know me. Please don’t bad mouth me. I don’t give a f***. I’m an olosho, it’s a good work”, she said. LAUTECH was, until late November, jointly owned by Osun and Oyo States. Oyo took possession after negotiations and in December, the State House of Assembly passed legislation on the ownership into law. The new law repealed the LAUTECH Law contained in Cap 67, Laws of Oyo State. It empowered the institution to establish other campuses or colleges in other parts of the state. The law also provides that the Governor is now the visitor to the university, amongst others.
