Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has said that Liverpool ‘lack belief in everything they do’. Wenger said this while reacting to Liverpool’s 2-0 defeat against Everton in the Premier League on Saturday. Everton inflicted defeat on Jurgen Klopp’s side at Anfield for the first time in 22 years as the Reds slipped to their fourth consecutive defeat in the English top-flight league. An early goal from Richarlison and a controversial late penalty from Gylfi Sigurdsson gave Carlo Ancelotti’s men all three points against Liverpool. “They are on a bad run, and this result tonight will deepen a little bit, the doubt they have,” Wenger told beIN SPORTS. “They lack belief in everything they do. It affects you and goes quickly through the ranks, but again tonight, they put the effort in, they were focused, motivated, but they lacked charisma around the team. “We have seen again tonight, at the top level, you pay for your weak points. “Overall, they question themselves now, Liverpool, but tonight I’d say they produced the desire, and the quality of the performance was quite alright, but they cannot score at the moment.”
