Liverpool has agreed a £2 million deal to sign Preston defender, Ben Davies ahead of Monday’s transfer deadline, Goal reports. The Premier League champions had opened talks with the Championship club, and Davies will now undergo a medical today. Davies is expected to provide a cover-up for long-term injured, Virgil van Dijk and Joel Matip at Anfield. Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp confirmed on Friday that the Reds would try to bring in at least one new face, with all four of their senior centre-backs currently sidelined through injury. Asked about Liverpool’s interest in Davies after Liverpool’s 3-1 victory against West Ham on Sunday, Klopp told Sky Sports: “Ben Davies, Tottenham… I have nothing to say about it. With this line-up it’s not a problem, it’s only if something else happens.” Davies, 25, is out of contract at the end of the 2020/21 season.
