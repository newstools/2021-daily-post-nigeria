The Federal Government will soon commence the arraignment of 5,000 suspected Boko Haram members in detention facilities across Nigeria. The Director-General of Legal Aid Council, Aliyu Abubakar, made the disclosure during a visit to Borno Governor, Babagana Zulum. Abubakar disclosed that the detainees were currently at Giwa Barracks, Maiduguri and Kainji Correctional Centres, among others. The official said the trial would be conducted by the Offices of the Attorney General of the Federation and the National Security Advisers in collaboration with the Theatre Command of Operation Lafiya Dole. The Legal Aid Council has been directed to provide defence for the inmates during the hearing of their cases. The council’s team has interviewed more than 280 captured insurgents to understand the nature of the crimes they will be indicted for. “It is necessary for them to be represented by the council to fulfill the provisions of the law. Under our laws, they are innocent until proven guilty. ”All evidence must be presented against them in court so that those that were found guilty are prosecuted and face the consequences of their action”, Abubakar said. The Director thanked the Nigerian Army and Operation Lafiya Dole for granting the council access to the suspects. Abubakar prayed that the country’s military and new leadership would end insurgency and armed banditry in the country. In his remarks, Zulum declared readiness to partner with the government parastatal to achieve its mandate. Represented by his deputy, Umar Kadafur, Zulum lauded the council for offering legal support to those in need. He assured the Borno government’s support for its activities. The governor urged all stakeholders to ensure sustainability of the Operation Safe Corridor program for rehabilitation of persons connected to insurgency.
