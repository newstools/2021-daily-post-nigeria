Normalcy has returned to Port Harcourt International Airport, Omagwa in Rivers State after members of Freight Forwarders Transport Association (FFTA) Saturday barricaded the road for several hours. The barricade at the airport has been removed while there is now a free flow of traffic on the Port Harcourt-Owerri road. Members of the Association had blocked the road with their trailer trucks in protest against an attack on one of their members by security operatives at a checkpoint around the airport junction. The incident took place Friday night after an argument broke out between a security agent and the driver. It took the intervention of the Ikwerre local government Chairman, Samuel Nwanosike on behalf of members of the Association to open the roads. Speaking with our correspondent, the Chairman of FFTA, Idris Ali who lamented the continued harassment of members by security operatives said the member who was attacked by the security agents have been taken to the hospital and is responding to treatment. DAILY POST reports that a checkpoint and a makeshift settlement of security operatives were destroyed by angry protesters.
