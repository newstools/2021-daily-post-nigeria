Tottenham Hotspur boss, Jose Mourinho, has commented on midfielder, Dele Alli’s performance following his side’s Europa League last-32 second-leg tie on Wednesday night. Alli scored an overhead kick as goals from Carlos Vinicius (2), and Gareth Bale ensured Tottenham qualified for Europa League last-16 ahead of Wolfsberg. Tottenham had won the first-leg 4-1 last week. Speaking on Alli’s display, Mourinho said at his post-match press conference that the England international played well against the visitors. “The goal I don’t need to speak because all the people around the world will see it,” Mourinho said. “For me, around the goal, he [Alli] played very well. You can see he is not fresh, but in this moment where we are going to play every three days, he will be important.” Tottenham’s next fixture is against Burnley in the Premier League on Sunday.
