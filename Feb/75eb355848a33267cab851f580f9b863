Former Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Manchester United to beat Southampton when both teams clash in the Premier League on Tuesday night at Old Trafford. Owen also predicted Arsenal to play a draw with Wolves tonight at Molineux Stadium. Providing his predictions, Owen told BetVictor: “Two weeks is a long time in football, just ask Ole Gunnar Solkjaer. One point from their last six is not what the United manager would have targeted following his sides excellent FA Cup win against Liverpool. “Visitors, Southampton, arrive here after a couple of underwhelming results of their own. Back-to-back defeats in the league mean the Saints have lost a bit of ground in the race for Europe. “Although he’s had them playing some excellent stuff this season, Ralph Hasenhüttl hasn’t got the biggest of squads, and his players have certainly more miles on the clock than many. “With that in mind, I think United’s strength in depth should be enough to see them secure the points. Manchester United 2, Southampton 1.” Commenting on the Wolves vs Arsenal, Owen said, “Arsenal shared the points with Manchester United on Saturday night in a match where neither team could honestly say they deserved all three points. “That said, Mikel Arteta will be a happy man as his side are now undefeated in seven Premier League matches and have conceded only twice in those fixtures. “Wolves arrive here amid a patchy run; however, I can’t help casting my mind back to their terrific performance at the Emirates earlier in the season. If they deploy similar tactics here, I think they could have some joy on the counter-attack. “This could be a cagey affair, so I’m siding with the draw. Wolves 1, Arsenal 1.” The kick-off time for Man United vs Southampton is 9:15 pm, while that of Wolves vs Arsenal will be 7 pm.
