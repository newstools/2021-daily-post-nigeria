The Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership (CACOL) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to rejig Nigeria’s security architecture. The Chairman, Debo Adeniran, made the call at the 15th Beko Ransome-Kuti Memorial Anniversary. He said Nigeria is confronted by Boko Haram, militancy in the Niger Delta, violence between herders and farming communities in South-East and South-West, Biafra agitation, kidnapping, among others. Adeniran noted that while focusing on the insurgency in the North-East, the federal government paid little attention to the deteriorating situation in the North-West, where armed gangs kill and maim and community dwellers. “Government soldiers also kill civilians indiscriminately and the Police are notorious for extrajudicial murder”, he said. Adeniran warned that Nigeria is turning to a Hobbessian state of nature where life is said to be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short” “The country’s economy is currently in a bad shape. The Naira is very weak compared to other notable currencies. The gap between the rich and the poor keeps widening without concrete steps to amend the grossly imbalanced socio-economic equation. “Our youth are engaging in illicit online deals while some of them that cannot engage in such deals often embark on dangerous journeys which involves travelling through the desert and on the high seas while desperately searching for greener pastures abroad.” CACOL told the Buhari administration to come up with a lasting solution to security challenges. “The whole security architecture of the country must be rejig. Government must check rampant corruption which prevents funds allocated to the troops on the ground from getting to them’, the organization said. During his lifetime, Beko, a foremost pro-democracy activist, fought regimes in Nigeria. The doctor served as Chairman of Nigerian Medical Association (NMA).
