Nigeria’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama, on Friday, revalidated his membership of the All Progressives Congress, APC. The minister, who carried out the exercise at his Eke ward, in Udi Local Government Area of Enugu, urged the residents to embrace the party. Similarly, the immediate past Governor of Enugu State, Barr. Sullivan Chime, also revalidated his membership of the party at his country home in Udi. Both of them were presented with their membership card by the Enugu State membership revalidation and registration panel, Senator Jonathan Zwingina. In his remarks, Chime said the APC was now a beautiful bride, as according to him, his former party, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, now lacked national leadership. He said, “I have come here to re-endorse my support and membership of the APC. This is the party that will take us to the next level. “I must appeal to our people to take this opportunity and come out and register. It is not enough to be a supporter of the party. This will afford us the opportunity to be equal members of the party, we will no longer hear about foundation or old members of the party. “We are now equal members of the party, so register and enjoy all rights and privileges. “PDP has become a party without national leadership, but in APC, we have a leader, a well organized party, come and register and sail with us.”
