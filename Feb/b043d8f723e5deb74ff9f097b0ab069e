The Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello on Thursday said the federal government has refused to support his state in the rescue of 41 people abducted from Government Science College, Kagara. Bello disclosed this while receiving the Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu in the state’s Government House. According to Bello: “At the moment, we do not feel any Federal presence here. “The Inspector-General of Police sent us four mobile units but we are to shoulder the financial responsibilities. So, where is the support? There is no support from anyone. “Yes, we had a delegation (Federal Government delegation) that came to visit and commiserate with us but that was all. “So, we are left to ourselves. “We have already made a commitment that we will bring back the children safely with or without anyone.” Bandits had recently abducted 27 students and 14 others from the Kangara area of the state.
