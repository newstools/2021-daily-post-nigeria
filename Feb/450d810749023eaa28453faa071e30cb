Following protests embarked upon by players of Kogi United and Confluence Queens over poor remuneration, Governor Yahaya Bello, on Monday, disbanded the two teams. The disbandment of the two state teams was confirmed in a statement issued by the Secretary to the State Government, Mrs. Folashade Arike Ayode. The reasons for the disbandment of the team was not stated in news aired on the state-owned radio, which was monitored by DAILY POST Monday evening. DAILY POST gathered that the dissolution is coming a day after the male football team, Kogi United lost by a lone goal to DMD of Maiduguri away from home. DAILY POST had earlier reported that before the state female football club played their match against FC Robo last Saturday, they had threatened to boycott the match, alleging that the government had failed to pay them their sign on fee and many other allowances. But the Confluence Queens later honoured the match and won with a lone goal after much pleading from the management of the club led by Abdul Sule. It could be recalled that the players had accused the government of failing to give priority to their welfare as they continue to play their league matches with empty stomachs. Some of the players who spoke to DAILY POST last Wednesday under the condition of anonymity, accused the government of neglecting its own football teams, but finds solace in outsiders despite their achievements in the state.
