The Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, has said that Nigeria might get COVID-19 vaccines in the next 10 days. The health minister made this known while addressing newsmen in Lagos on Saturday, NAN reports. According to him, the federal government has been promised that by the end of this month, which is about 10 days from now, the country will get the vaccines. “We do not produce the vaccines. They are manufactured abroad in about four or five countries,’’ he told newsmen at the end of an inspection tour of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) Idi-Araba. “South Africa has a licence to make the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, while Russia only recently gave India the licence to produce AstraZeneca,’’ the minister said. “However, countries that produced these vaccines had serious challenges with COVID-19 and decided to attend to their needs first, a situation that the WHO described as vaccine nationalism,” he said. Ehanire noted that about 75 per cent of vaccines already produced were being used in 10 countries adding that Nigeria had put all facilities in place to receive the vaccines.
