President Muhammadu Buhari and state governors will discuss the issue of fuel pricing on Thursday. Sen. Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment, made this known on Sunday night in Abuja after a bipartite meeting of the Federal Government and the organised labour at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa. Addressing journalists on their resolutions, Ngige explained the Federal Government has concluded discussions with the organised labour on fuel pricing. Ngigi said, “The labour side saw that they were making some points, and like I said, it is work in progress. Governors are going to discuss this on Thursday. “They’ve discussed this at the National Economic Council, and so, everybody is involved because we find ourselves in dire straits. There is no money for subsidy. “The NNPC has explained: What they’re doing is import-dependent. Deregulation is import-dependent, but they’re doing bulk purchasing. So, they can get discounts. “They are also using a foreign exchange that is discounted for them. They are not buying from the parallel market. So, all these things will be put in a basket, and a price will emerge from it.”
