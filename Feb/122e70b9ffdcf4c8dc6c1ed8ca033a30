A 38-year-old man, Aliyu Yusuf on Monday dragged his brother Ibrahim, before a Shari’a court in Rigasa, Kaduna State over a house belonging to their late father. Aliyu Yusuf told the court that the house, which was their inheritance, had been shared according to Islamic rules with each person owning a portion of the house. “My brother always enters my own side to do his business when he already has his own part. I want the court to intervene and stop him from trespassing”, he said. However, the defendant who was represented by his lawyer, Alhassan Aliyu, begged the court to pay a visit to the house, stressing that the complainant was not truthful. The judge, Malam Salisu Abubakar-Tureta subsequently ordered that the house be visited by court officials on Feb. 15. He then adjourned the matter until March 1 for continuation of hearing.
