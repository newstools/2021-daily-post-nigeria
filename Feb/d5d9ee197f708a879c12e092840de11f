Everton winger, Alex Iwobi, has revealed that he has no regrets leaving Arsenal for Carlo Ancelotti’s side. Iwobi said this ahead of Everton’s FA Cup fifth-round clash with Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday night at Goodison Park. The Nigerian international left his boyhood club Arsenal after 15 years at Emirates to join Everton in 2019 in a deal worth around £40millon. Iwobi told Sky Sports: “It is tough going from that at Arsenal. One manager, obviously Unai Emery came, and yeah it was a bit different because there were a lot of different methods, things were getting changed, positions, formations, and I’ve had to play in numerous positions. “So maybe I was a bit unsettled, but I don’t really want to say anything like an argument or problem because at the end of the day, as footballers, we should be able to cope with the situation. “Maybe I should’ve handled it better, but whether what happened in the past has made me who I’m today, so there is no regret.”
