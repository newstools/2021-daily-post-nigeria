Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has confirmed that midfielder, Paul Pogba, will miss the Red Devils’ Premier League clash with West Brom on Sunday at Hawthorns. Pogba sustained a thigh muscle injury during Man United’s Premier League 3-3 draw against Everton at Old Trafford last weekend. The France international missed Man United’s FA Cup 1-0 victory against West Ham United on Tuesday. ”Paul [Pogba] is still out [for the game],” Solskjaer said at his pre-match press conference on Friday. He added, “We have had a rare opportunity to do a bit of training and actually some recovery. “You have got Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and not a game until Sunday. That has been a rarity for us really.” The kick-off time for West Brom vs Man United is 3 pm.
