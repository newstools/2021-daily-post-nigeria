Nigerian Pastor, Mike Bamiloye, has warned that many people will lose their destinies on the bed of lustful pleasure over Valentine’s Day celebration. The clergyman made this on his Twitter handle on Saturday. According to him, “If Joseph had had fun with Portiphar’s wife, he would never have got to the palace to see the type of Glory he saw.” He, however, advised that people should not forget the main purpose behind the celebration of Valentines Day as it’s not a day for fornication or carrying out any manner of ungodly acts. “Today is a day of death. A ‘day of Fun’, when many men and ladies will slaughter their destinies on the bed of lustful pleasure. By next morning, it is done! Destiny Auctioned to a young man or a lady whose future has been mortgaged to the devil. “If Joseph had had a fun with Portiphar’s wife, he would never have got to the palace to see the type of Glory he saw. “He escaped that trap that would have aborted his destiny on which so many lives in Egypt and Canaan land, depended upon. “Also, a sad story of a young man on his own valentines night in Proverbs 7:6-27 said he had thought he wanted to have a fun that night, he had thought he wanted to enjoy himself, but crashed his future in a night of fun. “May we never forget the main purpose behind the Valentines Day celebration,” he said.
