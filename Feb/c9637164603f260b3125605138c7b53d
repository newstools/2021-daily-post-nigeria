Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has commented on the performances of defender, Marcos Alonso, following his side’s 2-0 win over Burnley in the Premier League on Sunday. Tuchel said that Alonso, who started ahead of Ben Chilwell, ‘did very well’ against Burnley. Chelsea defeated Burnley at Stamford Bridge, thanks to two goals from Cesar Azpilicueta and Alonso. Speaking on Alonso’s display, Tuchel was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying after the game: “We had a reason. It wasn’t that we were unhappy with Chilly, absolutely not. We opted for a bit more size for defending set-pieces, and I know from the time of Antonio Conte Marcos is used to playing this role. He has good timing for arriving in the box. “We are very happy he could score the second goal, which finished the game. It’s not easy when you haven’t played for a long time, but he did very well.” He added, “If we manage to find a starting XI that can guarantee to win us 20 in a row, we will not change! It’s very unlikely this will happen, and we need everybody. “I am only some days in, and we decided very late for the back three and the two number sixes to stay because of the impact we expected from Burnley.” Chelsea’s next match is against Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday.
