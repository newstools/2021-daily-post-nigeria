The Senate, on Thursday, considered a bill seeking to stop employers in the private and public sectors from engaging employable Nigerian graduates as casual workers. The Prohibition of Casualization Bill 2020, is sponsored by Senator Ayo Akinyelure (PDP-Ondo Central). Akinyelure, while citing the banking industry, said banks turn female marketers into harlots and sexual slaves in a desperate attempt to make them meet huge targets. The Senator observed that casualization of graduates in the Nigerian labour market has become a subject of great concern to everyone. Akinyelure said more workers continue to groan under the strategy of cutting costs by employers rendering them inferior to their counterparts in other countries. “Young graduates are employed as marketers and given unrealistic targets. The female desperate in keeping their jobs turned to harlotry and sex slavery, moving from one office to the other looking for invisible customers. It is high time this evil act is stopped,” he fumed. Senator Biodun Olujimi (PDP – Ekiti South) supported Akinyelure’s observation on banks. Olujimi said many girls have been turned into what cannot be imagined. The lawmaker lamented marketers are not promoted if they don’t bring in funds. Noting that profit has to be made, she said it does not give banks the power to use their staff anyhow. Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege decried the treatment of casual workers by oil companies operating in Nigeria. Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, charged the Committee on Employment, Labour and Productivity to strike a balance to ensure that casual workers are not made victims of layoffs. The bill after scaling second reading was referred to the Committee on Employment, Labour and Productivity. A report is expected within four weeks.
