Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, said he could not answer the repayment plan for the cost of the Nigeria-Niger rail project. Amaechi appeared on Channels TV’s Sunday Politics. The Kano-Maradi (Niger Republic) rail line has been a subject on controversy. The minister confirmed the project will cost $1.9bn. He disclosed that the federal govenrment will source the fund “from mostly Europe”. Asked to explained how Nigeria will refund and the time frame, Amaechi said only the Ministry of Finance has the answers. “The problem I have is that most Nigerians are not able to distinguish between Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Finance. “That is the responsibility of the Minsitry of Finance; when we’ll pay, what the terms are. That question can be directed to the Minister of Finance. “For us in Transportation, our job is to work with the Ministry of Finance, procure the loan and commence construction”, he stated.
