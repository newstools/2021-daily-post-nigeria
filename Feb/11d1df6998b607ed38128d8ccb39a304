President of the Senate Ahmed Lawan, on Saturday flouted the COVID-19 law in Yobe State. The lawmaker failed to observe the physical distance rule while revalidating his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Lawan was at Katuzu ward in Bade Local Government Area of Yobe North Senatorial District. He had his mask on but was closely surrounded by at least 20 people, some of whom were not wearing their masks properly. Under the COVID-19 regulation for gatherings, “a physical distance of at least two metres must be maintained at all times between persons”. President Muhammadu Buhari signed the Health Protection Regulations on January 26. Days later, he too was caught violating the provisions while revalidating his membership of the APC in his hometown, Daura, Katsina State. Photos of the President sparked outrage. Nigerians accused him and other highly placed persons of acting above the law. Lawan, in his remarks, said the APC exercise was targeting one hundred million Nigerians to become members.
