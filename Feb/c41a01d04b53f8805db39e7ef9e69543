The Governor of Osun State, Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola, has lauded the foresight of the founders of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), for establishing a platform that promotes national unity and integration. Oyetola, speaking during a courtesy visit to his office by NYSC’s National Governing Board on Friday, also commended the scheme for its role in building entrepreneurial values in youths through the mandatory orientation programme. “NYSC is a scheme that is significant to national unity and integration. It has proven to be a major driving force for unity, particularly among the youths. There is nothing like a religious or ethnic divide, everyone is simply satisfied to be identified as a Corper. “This kind of atmosphere, where your affiliation or origin does not matter much, is what we should strive to attain in Nigeria. “On the basis of this very critical and significant derivative of the scheme, it should actually be encouraged. Believe me, this is a scheme we are all proud of having experienced its benefits. “Apart from fostering national unity and integration, the scheme has become a veritable tool for entrepreneurial training during the orientation programmes, and this is very critical to youth engagement in our country today.
