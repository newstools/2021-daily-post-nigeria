The Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Monday insisted that no one should be persuaded to join the All Progressives Congress, APC. Akeredolu who made the comment in Akure, stressed that only those with the zeal to contribute to the party financially should be lured. The governor stated this during a stakeholders’ meeting ahead of the party’s membership registration and revalidation exercise scheduled to commence on Tuesday across the 3009 polling units of the state. Receiving members of the committee from the National Secretariat which was led by Murphy Lawal, Akerdolu emphasized that with members’ financial involvement, smooth running of the party will be hitch-free. “There’s no basis to register people who will not be committed to the party through financial contributions. “If you cannot pay dues to the party don’t join our party. If you’re a financial member of the party, you’ll have the same rights with those who pay their dues. Akeredolu also urged the party to look into the direction of online registration for members in future exercise. Earlier, the Secretary of the Committee, Taiwo Olatubosun disclosed that all the materials needed for the exercise had been received and intact. According to him, the exercise which will afford new members to join APC will be ward-based as he stressed that it will be a continuous exercise.
