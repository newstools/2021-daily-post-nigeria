The Senate on Wednesday confirmed the appointment of Mr. Aghughu Adolphus Arhotomhenla, as the Auditor-General for the Federation. Arhotomhenla was confirmed after the consideration of a report by the Committee on Public Accounts. Chairman of the Committee, Senator Matthew Urhogide, said the committee was impressed by the qualifications of Arhotomhenla and found him capable of assuming the office’s responsibilities. In his remarks, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan urged the Federal Government to make available the necessary wherewithal to improve on the working operations of the office of the Auditor-General to boost anti-corruption war. According to Lawan, “The National Assembly, the Parliament and the Executive must ensure that the Auditor-General remains truly autonomous and independent.” Lawan in a statement signed by his Special Assistant, Ezrel Tabiowo also demanded new office accommodation for the Auditor-general, adding that the Audit House is not a befitting headquarters for the Auditor-General for the federation. He urged those who believe in fighting corruption to help improve the Auditor-General’s office and operations for the Federation. “The Auditor-General needs office accommodation like the Treasury House, or the EFCC Complex where he can accommodate all his staff, and all he needs to do is to post them out to go the MDAs and carry out their auditing jobs and return. “With an effective Auditor-General, we may not need EFCC or ICPC, and if you need them, they cannot take precedence over the Auditor-General which it appears is the case today, “the statement read.
