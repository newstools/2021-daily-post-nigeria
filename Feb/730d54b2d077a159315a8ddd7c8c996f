The House of Representatives is moving towards giving the nominated Service Chiefs a fast confirmation. The Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila at plenary on Wednesday announced the formation of an ad hoc committee to speed up the confirmation process. Gbajabiamila said allowing the joint committees of Defence, Army, Navy and Airforce to screen the nominees will be cumbersome. Earlier, Gbajabiamila read a letter from the President seeking the confirmation of the new service chiefs. The nominees are, Major-General Leo Irabor as Chief of Defence Staff, Major Gen Ibrahim Attahiru as Chief of Army Staff, Air Vice Marshall Isiaka Amao as Chief of Air Staff, and Rear Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo, as the new Naval Chief. The ad hoc committee will be Chaired by Chairman Committee on Defence, Babajimi Benson from Lagos State. According to Gbajabiamila, allowing 200members of joint committees to do the screening will be hard. He described the decision as “ease of doing business.”
