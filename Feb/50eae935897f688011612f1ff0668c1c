A Russian expert on Saturday said Wuhan’s Huanan seafood market may have made it possible for the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) to spread, but it does not mean the virus originated there. The expert, Vladimir Dedkov, who is also a member of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) expert team, was quoted as saying “There is no evidence that the virus originated there but hypothetically, there are all conditions for the spread of the virus there.“ Dedkov also debunked the theory of a virus leakage while visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology along with nine other WHO experts on Wednesday. He said, “Of course, it was important for our mission to visit this facility, talk to our colleagues and see how everything is organised there. “The laboratory is perfectly equipped. It is hard for me to imagine that something could have leaked from there,’’ Sputnik quoted him as saying. DAILY POST reports that the virus which was rumoured to have started in a seafood market in Wuhan has killed 2.3million people. A total of 105 million persons have been confirmed positive and 58.6 million persons have recovered from the disease.
