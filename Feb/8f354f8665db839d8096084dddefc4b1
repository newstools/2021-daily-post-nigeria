The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, on Monday, said the Federal Government is working hard to ensure normalcy returns to rural areas where crises have erupted among farmers and the Fulani herdsmen before the rainy season starts. Lawan said this while addressing States House Correspondents shortly after a closed doors meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Aso Rock. He said his meeting with the president was fruitful, adding that they deliberated on security issues across the country. Lawan assured that Nigerians troubled areas would in the two months have their environment secured to enable them engage in agricultural activities and other businesses. According to him, “I have come to meet with Mr. President, to discuss the issue of security of our nation. And in fact, there is nothing more important today or more topical, than the security of Nigeria. “We have discussed, we had a very extensive discussion on the security of all parts of Nigeria, and how we should go about improving the situation, we all have roles to play. “Nobody would like to see the kind of thing that we experience in various parts of the country in the form of insecurity. As political leaders, we cannot shy away from that, we have to get our people secured; we have to secure the environment for them to earn the means of livelihood. “We would like to see our farmers go back to farms before the rainy season starts. And this means we have to secure the rural parts of Nigeria as well as the urban centres because we need businesses to flourish. “So, I believe that between now and probably the next two months, there will be a lot of activities to ensure that we secure our environments for people to lead a very normal life, where we also believe that the government is headed in the right direction.”
