Nikki Haley, Donald Trump’s longtime loyalist and former United Nations ambassador, has declared that the former US President cannot run for the presidency again. She also blamed the Republicans for supporting Trump’s campaign to reverse the 2020 election results. Trump is currently on trial in the Senate for allegedly inciting a mob to attack the Capitol. Haley told Politico Magazine that she is “deeply disturbed” by what has happened to Trump since his election defeat to Joe Biden. “He’s not going to run for federal office again,” Haley, who served as Trump’s envoy to the United Nations from 2017-2018, said. Have, a former South Carolina governor dismissed speculation that Trump will return to seek the presidency in 2024 so as to avenge his defeat and second impeachment “I don’t think he’s going to be in the picture,” she said. “I don’t think he can. He’s fallen so far. We need to acknowledge he let us down. “He went down a path he shouldn’t have, and we shouldn’t have followed him, and we shouldn’t have listened to him. And we can’t let that ever happen again,” she added.
