The Olu of Ilaro and Paramount Ruler of Yewa land, Oba Kehinde Olugbenle, has said there are reports of plans by herdsmen to attack major town in Yewa axis of Ogun State, asking President Muhammadu Buhari to “stop in the bomb before it is too late.” In a statement on Saturday, Oba Olugbenle drew the attention of President Buhari and all the security agencies to what he termed the continued siege of the entire Yewa land of Ogun State in the last few weeks by “armed herdsmen and bandits, callously killing, including literally slaughtering and maiming our people.” According to the monarch, “The criminal and dangerous activities of these herdsmen have so far happened in Egua, Oja-Odan, Igan Alade, Gbokoto, Ijoun, Owode Ketu, Ebute Igbooro, Imeko Afon and other places with reports of plans to attack major towns in Yewa land.” In his plea, the traditional ruler implores the Federal Government and the Ogun State Government to act fast in securing the lives of the people before it is too late. The statement reads in part: “The Federal Government and the State Government are hereby implored, as a matter of extreme urgency, to act fast to secure the lives and properties of our people before it spirals out of complete control. “In this situation, it is not out of place that people may resort to self help to defend themselves if the government fails to guarantee their safety as citizens of Nigeria in the face of renewed insurgency by these criminals terrorizing our people with arms and dangerous weapons. “I am issuing this press release as Paramount Ruler of the region and in close consultation with the entire Yewa Traditional Council and my people, in the high hope that government at both state and federal levels, together with the security agencies, would live up to expectation of their responsibility as enshrined in the constitution to ensure the security of our lives and properties in Yewa land. “Our people should cooperate with the state government on various security measures already mapped out to curb the activities of these bandits in the days ahead. A stitch in time saves nine,” Olugbenle submitted.
