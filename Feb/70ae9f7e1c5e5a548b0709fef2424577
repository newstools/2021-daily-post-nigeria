Aisha Yesufu, popular activist, has accused state governors and Minister of Information of speaking for terrorists. Yesufu, a co-convener of BringBackOurGirls, BBOG, advocacy group, also accused religious rulers of speaking for terrorists. She stated this while speaking at the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, annual law week in Calabar, Cross River State. Yesufu said professional bodies should wake up to its responsibilities of defending citizens. She said: “Terrorists have governors speaking for them, they have the Minister of Information, religious rulers all speaking up for them. Who do citizens have speaking up for them? “The professional bodies, most especially the NBA must wake up to its responsibilities.” Yesufu’s comment is coming at a time bandits and killer herdsmen have been on rampage across the country. Amid the abductions by bandits, popular Islamic cleric, Sheikh Abubakar Gumi had met with them in their hideouts. After meeting the bandits, Gumi had said the federal government knows their hideouts. However, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed had said the government can not destroy forests where bandits use as hideouts to carry out their criminal activities. Mohammed had claimed the ecosystem would be affected if the government decides to destroy forests where the bandits camp.
