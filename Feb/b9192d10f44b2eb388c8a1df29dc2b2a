Tottenham boss, Jose Mourinho has revealed his conversation with referee, Andre Marriner after his side’s 1-0 home loss to the Blues on Thursday night. It was a spot kick scored by Jorginho in the first half that separated the two London sides in Thomas Tuchel’s first game against Mourinho in the Premier League. Eric Dier had clipped Timo Warner in the eighteen yard area and Mourinho feels the offence was not enough for referee Marriner to have awarded the spot kick After the game, the Portuguese legendary manager was seen talking to the English referee. He was asked after the match what the conversation was all about as Mourinho said, “I told him something that he knows already, that I consider him to be one of the best referees in the Premier League and I care for him. He’s a referee that I have big admiration for. “That gives me probably good position to tell him that I didn’t like his performance. So it was basically like that. I have a very good relationship with Andre and that gives me a good position to say that I didn’t like the performance.” Yesterday’s loss to Tuchel’s Blues meant that Mourinho has lost three consecutive games.
