No fewer than seven bandits have repented and accepted the peace initiative in Zamfara State as an erstwhile notorious bandit, Auwalun Daudawa and his group surrendered 20 AK47 rifles and five more dangerous weapons to the Governor, Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle who handed them over to the Police Command in the State. In a brief ceremony at the premises of the Governor’s office Monday evening, Auwalun Daudawa handed over the weapons along with his teammates, swearing with the Holy Quran not to revert to their old ways of life. Auwalun Daudawa said “I am not surrendering these weapons out of fear of anything but for the belief that Governor Matawalle is sincere in his peace deal and that I and my team are tired of our old criminal ways. “In all the battles and conflicts so far, I have never feared anything nor got wounded even once. I thank God that I am liberated by His mercy and I ask for forgiveness from the society” Auwalu added. He said he is no longer interested in going back to the bush, requesting that Governor Matawalle should allow him to stay in Gusau and go back to school. Responding, Governor Matawalle commended the courage of Auwalun Daudawa for embracing the peace along with all his team and promising that his administration will never renege on its promise to honour all the terms agreed in the peace deal and will continue to woo others in the bush until there is no more bandits remaining in the state.
