President Muhammadu Buhari has hailed America for supporting the candidacy of Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala for the position of Director-General of World Trade Organization (WTO). The office of the United States Trade Representative announced this on Friday. In a statement on Saturday by his spokesperson, Gara Shehu, Buhari said the withdrawal of the country’s initial objection was remarkable. “We certainly welcome the decision of the new U.S administration to remove the last obstacle in the path of Dr. Okonjo-Iweala to becoming the first female and the first person of African descent to lead the organization,” said the President. “Nigeria and the entire African continent are happy about this new U.S position, which signifies a shift and an important turnaround in the relations between our continent and the United States under the Biden administration.” “Today, we see that the United States stands with Nigeria and Africa with the acceptance of our widely respected citizen, Okonjo-Iweala to lead the WTO.” Buhari said Nigeria looks forward to working very closely with the Biden administration on all issues of common interests. He listed accelerated economic growth, fight against terrorism and deepening progress on development issues.
