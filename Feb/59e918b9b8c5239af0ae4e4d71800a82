Popular Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo Igboho, Monday, stormed Ogun State to chase away Fulani herdsmen, who he said were killing, kidnapping and raping the people of Yewa area of the state. DAILY POST recalls that some traditional rulers in Yewa North Local Government area of the state had lamented that some men in military uniform led Fulani herdsmen to various villages, flogging residents who would not allow cows to graze on their farms. Igboho, who arrived Ogun on Monday afternoon, said he was in the state to chase away the Fulani herdsmen.  The activist commended Governor Dapo Abiodun, who he said spoke up against the “gruesome killing of his people by killer herdsmen.” “My name is Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho. We are in Oja Odan area of Ogun State to chase away killer Fulani herdsmen terrorising the people of Ogun State. “They they have been killing, kidnapping and raping our people in Yoruba land; and the governor of Ogun State said he will no longer tolerate the killing of his people by killer herdsmen. He said he was elected to protect the people. “So, we are about to enter Igua bush to chase away Fulani herdsmen. I’m here to rescue my people from killer herdsmen. Enough is enough. This is Yoruba land. This is Yoruba nation. By the grace of God, we are moving to Igua to chase all the Fulani away. We don’t want them in our land again,” Sunday Igboho said as he addressed a cheering crowd. Video
