Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, on Friday, told the state’s new Commissioner of Police (CP), Mr. Friday Eboka, that an unknown police officer in mufti blocked his convoy with an AK47 rifle while he was on project inspection. Wike made the allegation when Eboka paid him a courtesy visit at Government House, Port Harcourt. The governor explained that the incident happened on Thursday while he was on an inspection tour of the new Rivers State legislative residential quarters. Wike said: “Yesterday (Thursday), I was going out for inspection. We saw one guy carrying an Ak47, not in a police uniform. “He was on mufti, blocking us from Waterlines Junction when we went to inspect the Rivers State Assembly’s quarter’s on-going project. “We moved on to inspect the Speaker’s residence project, and the man was still following us. So, the security wondered what was going on and stopped him.”
