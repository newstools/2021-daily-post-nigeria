Manchester United captain, Harry Maguire, has warned the Red Devils players about Everton striker, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, ahead of both teams’ clash in the Premier League on Saturday night. Maguire said that stopping Calvert-Lewin will be key if Man United are to record a second home Premier League win in the space of a week at Old Trafford. The 27-year-old defender and Calvert-Lewin are both international teammates with the England national team. Man United head to the game after thrashing Southampton 9-0 in their previous game on Wednesday, while Everton won 2-1 against Leeds United. “Yeah, in the Premier League you play against different types of strikers week in, week out, so you know every striker is going to bring something different, and everyone has strengths, and everyone has weaknesses,” Maguire told United Review. “I know Dom from our time with England and he’s very physical and a handful, and we will need to be right on our game to keep him quiet. “If we manage to do that, it will be a big part for us in, hopefully, taking steps towards the victory.” Calvert-Lewin has scored 12 goals for Carlo Ancelotti’s side so far this season.
