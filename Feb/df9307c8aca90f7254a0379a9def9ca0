Nigerian rapper, Folarin Falana ‘Falz’ has slammed the Nigerian government over the arrest of Mr Macaroni and other End SARS protesters at Lekki tollgate. Macaroni was arrested alongside some protesters at the Lekki toll gate. Falz, reacting, described the arrest as a shameful behaviour and oppression of Nigerians. According to him, the Nigerian government had shown they don’t want peace by using threat on citizens. On his Twitter page, he wrote: “What is this shameful behaviour? Are these people insane? Citizens are peacefully protesting and you are arresting. “How is this supposed to solve the problems that they have already caused? “Macaroni has been picked up, the Nigerian government basically saying they do not want peace ohI am tired of just coping. I am tired of just managing. This is a fu*king shithole we are living in and we simply cannot continue like this. “They are using this threat of force and violence because they expect that we would naturally fear for our lives, but the life we dey live no kuku get meaning before.”
