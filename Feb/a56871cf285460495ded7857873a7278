Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has named the players who will miss his side’s Tuesday’s Emirates FA Cup fifth-round clash with West Ham United. According to Solskjaer, Eric Bailly and Phil Jones, along with Paul Pogba would not take part in Man United’s squad to tackle West Ham at Old Trafford due to injury. Solskjaer’s men head to the game after playing a 3-3 draw with Everton in the Premier League on Saturday. “Eric is getting better. He’s still not available for the Cup game tomorrow we don’t think,” Solskajer was quoted by Man United’s official website as saying on Monday. “He’s been out on the grass and training and we will make a decision tomorrow. I don’t think he will be involved. “Everyone [else] is available and trained this morning, apart from Phil [Jones] who’s still out.” He added, “Of course, Paul has been very important for us and we’re not going to take any risks. [So it is] A few weeks definitely.” The kick-off time for Man United vs West Ham is 8:30 pm.
