A 32-year-old nurse, Alex Pam, was on Wednesday tried before a Jos high court for allegedly drugging and raping a 22-year-old student. The police counsel, Ms Olive Okpuru, said the defendant on December 11, 2020, drugged a Plateau College of Health Technology student, Zawan, and raped her. The offence contravened and is punishment under sections 57 and 208 of the Penal Code of Plateau Law 2017. Okpuru alleged that the defendant, who works in a clinic near the victimâ€™s residence, injected his victim and raped her. She prayed for an adjournment to enable the prosecution to prove its case. The defendant pleaded not guilty. The Defence Counsel, H.K. Umar did not oppose the application, NAN reports. In her ruling, Justice Christine Dabup ordered that the nurse be remanded in a correctional centre. She then adjourned the case until May 21 for hearing.
