The away leg of Manchester United’s UEFA Europa League round of 32 fixture against Real Sociedad will now take place at Juventus’s Allianz Stadium in Turin. Man United made this known in a post via its website on Tuesday ahead of their FA Cup fifth-round clash with West Ham United at Old Trafford. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men were set to travel to Reale Arena, in San Sebastian, Spain, to take on the La Liga club on Thursday 18 February. However, the match, which kicks off at 17:55 GMT, has been moved to Italy because of the Spanish government restrictions on travellers entering the country from England, due to the new COVID-19 (coronavirus) variant. The second leg will be played at Old Trafford at 20:00 GMT on Thursday 25 February. Both games will take place behind closed doors amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s the third Europa League game in succession in which Man United have played at a neutral venue. Last season’s knockout stages were concluded as one-off ties in Germany due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Red Devils beating Copenhagen 1-0 in the quarter-final before falling to eventual winners Sevilla at the semi-final stage – both encounters took place in Cologne.
