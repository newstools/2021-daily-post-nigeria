Chelsea head coach, Frank Lampard, has named three key players that will miss his side’s FA Cup third-round tie with Morecambe on Sunday afternoon. The players are Reece James, Andreas Christensen and N’Golo Kante. According to Lampard, James, Christensen and Kante are currently injured. The Blues boss said this on Friday during his pre-match press conference. Chelsea head to the game after losing to 3-1 to Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City in the Premier League last Sunday. “I am not going to talk about the starting line-up for Morecambe but Reece James is out of the game although he will be training with us tomorrow but the game comes too early,” Lampard reported. “The same as Andreas Christensen and N’Golo Kante, who is out also with a minor hamstring injury so he misses this game and he is suspended for Fulham next Friday anyway. So we will get him right.”
