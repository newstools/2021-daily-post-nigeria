Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo has sent a condolence letter to the family of late Jubril Martins-Kuye, who passed on yesterday after a brief illness. Martins-Kuye, a former Nigerian Minister of Commerce and Industry, was buried on Sunday at his Ago-Iwoye country home in Ogun State. Reacting through his letter, Obasanjo said it was with shock that he received the sad news of the passing of the late politician. Speaking about the deceased, Obasanjo described him as a committed nationalist and an effective representative of his people, adding that he was a detribalised Nigerian who had friends across the country. “I feel the burden of the irreparable loss of one of the senior and dedicated leaders in our great party then, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),” the Ex-President stated. The Balogun Owu recalled that the late Asiwaju of Ago Iwoye, Senator Martins-Kuye worked closely with him in the PDP and government, particularly as his Minister of State for Finance from 1999 to 2003, adding that “he was a seasoned politician noted for his tremendous organisational ability. He demonstrated wisdom, honesty and good leadership.” According to Obasanjo, Kuye was one of the rare Nigerian politicians who shunned ethnic chauvinism even at the risk of incurring the displeasure of his kinsmen, saying “he will be sorely missed by all of us.” “I hereby extend on behalf of my family and on my own behalf our sincere condolences on the transition of your dear father and pray that the Almighty Allah grant you and the family, including his wife, the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss. May his gentle soul rest in perfect peace, Obasanjo prayed.
