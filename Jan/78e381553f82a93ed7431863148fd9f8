Nollywood actress, Elvina Ibru, has revealed that she tested positive for the dread coronavirus disease. Ibru in a video via her Instagram account said she has been isolating and taking her medication since her test came back positive. She, however, appealed to Nigerians to believe that the virus is real and take all precautions. “I just want to tell all of you that walk around without face masks or hand sanitizers that coronavirus is real and am currently battling the virus. “I have been in one room all by myself. I can’t even hug my son, sisters, brother or any of my family members. “Anybody can contract this virus and I don’t think it’s something to be ashamed of or kept from the public. It’s better to let the people out there know that this is serious and it does exist. “I am very lucky to be able to make a video to let everyone know that this is true. Two days ago I couldn’t even do anything because I was constantly coughing and I was in a very bad state. “This virus could have gotten anywhere because I was certain I made sure I stayed at home and avoided some gatherings and parties too but yet I still got the virus. “Please I Urge everyone to be careful out there, this disease is real and make sure you are doing everything possible to be safe, ” she said.
