Liverpool legend, Steven Gerrard, has been identified as the possible replacement for current manager, Jurgen Klopp. Former Reds defender, Phil Thompson believes Gerrard, currently at the helm of affairs in Ranger, Scotland has a “fair chance” of being the next boss at Anfield He noted that Gerrard’s exploits at Rangers suggest that the former England midfielder has a “fair chance” of managing the Premier League champions. Klopp has led the Reds to Champions League and Premier League trophies and has his current contract running until the summer of 2024. But Thompson expects the 40-year-old former Liverpool captain to be in the Reds’ thoughts as next manager. “I would think Steven’s got a fair chance of succeeding Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool,” Thompson told Paddy Power’s podcast From The Horse’s Mouth. “The thing with Stevie is he took on a very difficult job at Rangers. It wasn’t easy going in there with the success of Celtic. “So he’s obviously the one that comes to mind when it comes to next Liverpool manager.”
