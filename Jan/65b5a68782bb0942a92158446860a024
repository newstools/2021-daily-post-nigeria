Nigerian movie icon, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde has cleared the air on her alleged extramarital affair with former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. The veteran filmmaker also threatened to take legal actions against a media outlet over the allegation. The gossip platform had via Instagram, vowed to spill details of the alleged secret affair between Omotola and the former Edo State Governor. But reacting angrily to the allegation, the actress gave the gossip blog an ultimatum to take down the post or otherwise face the consequences of their action. She further asked her followers to report the blog’s page on Instagram for possible suspension. “I ordinarily don’t do this but after thinking about it thoroughly and seeking advice I have decided to! So this Blog ran this story and people started coming to my page. “I’ve always known there are people who are sick and will tell you stories that have never happened but to publish that on a platform as big as Instagram? You must be held accountable,” she wrote on Instagram. “Still waiting for the so-called blog to post the proof of their dirty insinuation. You don’t just wake up and randomly write nonsense! You will prove your story and be found,” she added. Omotola is married to Captain Matthew Ekeinde and the couple is blessed with four children.
