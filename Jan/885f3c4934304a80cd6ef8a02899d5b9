The Senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has accused the Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi and some leaders of the All Progressives Congress, APC, of mounting pressure on Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State not to evict criminal Fulani herdsmen in the state. Pastor Giwa, in a statement he personally signed and forwarded to DAILY POST on Monday, advised Akeredolu to be a man of his words instead of trying to listen to some selfish politicians in the Southwest. The seven-day ultimatum given by Akeredolu to herders to vacate forest reserve expires today as Southwest governors led by Dr. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State meets with members of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MACBAN. However, Giwa alleged that Fayemi was doing everything possible to prevent Akeredolu from sending the herders packing. He said: “I have it on good authority that governor Fayemi and some leaders of the APC in the South-West are mounting pressure on governor Akeredolu to rescind his decision on sending Fulani herdsmen packing in Ondo state. “Let me advise governor Akeredolu to be a man of his words instead of trying to listen to some selfish politicians who only care for their political ambitions. “The people have tolerated Fulani herdsmen since 2015, and they can no longer watch the herders killing them.”
