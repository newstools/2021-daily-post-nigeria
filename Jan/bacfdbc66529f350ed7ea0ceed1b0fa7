The President of the Resident Doctors (ARD) of the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH), Dr Badmus Habeeb, has revealed that 20 doctors contracted the dreaded coronavirus disease within the past three weeks in Kwara State. Speaking during an interview with Channels Tv, Habeeb said the association was battling with the pandemic “based on available resources”. He noted that the discovery of vaccines has brought hope and relief to everyone. According to him, the vaccines have so far proven to be effective, adding that Nigerians need to get vaccinated once it arrives while adhering strictly to other COVID-19 protocols. “I must reiterate that this is not the best of times for us, our families and the affected patients. “So, it seems we may not be able to get the vaccine anytime soon. The public should adhere strictly to the laid down guidelines on the prevention and further spread of this virus,” he said.
