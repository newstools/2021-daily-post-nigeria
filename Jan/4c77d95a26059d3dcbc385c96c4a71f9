Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said he is now looking to bring in players during the January window, after moving on some squad members. Arteta was keen to allow some players leave this month, after cutting out the likes of Mesut Ozil and Sokratis from both his Premier League and Europa League squads. Ozil will join Fenerbahce imminently, while Sokratis’ contract has also been terminated. Sead Kolasinac and William Saliba have both left the club on loan. Arteta, speaking to the media on Thursday, explained the second half of the window will now be about strengthening his squad. He said: “We are in that process right now. We’ve done the first part more or less and we are focusing now on the second phase. “Obviously this market and the context makes it really difficult but we are looking at options and we will see what we can do.” Arteta added that he is keen to bolster his options in various positions – particularly left-back – although he refused to comment on Arsenal’s approach for Real Madrid midfielder Martin Odegaard.
