Inter Milan striker, Romelu Lukaku, has become a target for Manchester City, who will invest £200 million in their squad in several areas at the end of the season, the UK Telegraph reports. Pep Guardiola’s men sit four points behind leaders Manchester United with a game in hand, ahead of their match with Crystal Palace on Sunday. But City face a summer rebuilding, with the likes of Sergio Aguero, Fernandinho and Eric Garcia able to leave for free. Guardiola will be in the market for a new striker, left back and a defensive midfielder. One area of concern is a long-term replacement for striker Aguero, who has struggled with injury problems since the start of the season. The 32-year-old striker’s contract expires in six months, and he is yet to make a decision on his future. But City will reportedly target a new striker even if Aguero ends up staying at the Etihad beyond this summer. It is believed that Lukaku, Dortmund striker Erling Haaland and Benfica forward, Darwin Nunez have been targeted as long-term successors to Aguero. Lukaku has previously played for City’s rivals, Manchester United, between 2017 and 2019. But he struggled for minutes under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer despite scoring 42 goals in 96 appearances in all competitions.
