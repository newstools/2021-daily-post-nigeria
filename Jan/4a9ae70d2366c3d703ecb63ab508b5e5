A 29-year-old, identified as Mustapha Idris, has been sentenced to death by hanging by the Jigawa State High court for killing his pregnant girlfriend, Nafisa Hashimu. Mustapha and late Nafisa, a divorcee, resided in Daneji village in the State. Following the police investigation, it was discovered that Mustapha slit the throat of late Nafisa, leaving her to die in the pool of her blood. When interrogated, the suspect initially denied the allegation but later confessed to committing the crime. Idris confessed that he killed Ms Nafisu after she told him she was three months pregnant “I killed her to avoid the shame of giving birth outside wedlock. “I am ashamed of how the society will see us after she delivers the unborn child out of wedlock, and thus I decided to terminate her life to stay away from shame,” he said in court. In a ruling, the presiding judge, Justice Ahmed Kazaure, found him guilty and sentenced him to death by hanging.
