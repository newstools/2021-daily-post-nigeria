Former Premier League striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Liverpool to beat Manchester United in today’s FA Cup fourth round clash. Owen, a former Manchester United and Liverpool star, believes Jurgen Klopp’s side can claim the victory against the Red Devils at Old Trafford to book their place in the FA Cup fifth round. Liverpool head to the game after losing 1-0 to Burnley in the Premier League on Thursday, while Man United defeated Fulham 2-1. “For the second time in a week, old rivals Manchester United and Liverpool face-off. This time Old Trafford is the venue with a place in the quarter-finals up for the grabs,” Owen told BetVictor. “With that in mind, we could see quite a change in line-ups and possibly tactics. Last week’s match was a highly tactical affair, and out of the two teams, United would have probably been happier after 90 minutes. “Now, in the cup, I think this could pan out differently. With United at home, I do not think they will be willing to give up as much territory to Liverpool as they did at Anfield. “If that materialises and Man United truly have a go, it could leave the door wide open for Liverpool to capitalise on the counter. “With that in mind, I reckon Liverpool will get through by the narrowest of margins, Man United 1, Liverpool 2,” he added. The kick-off time for Man United vs Liverpool is 6 p.m.
