Arsenal legend, Ian Wright, has singled out Emile Smith Rowe for praise following the club’s FA Cup 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Saturday. Wright also revealed manager, Mikel Arteta’s biggest problem at Arsenal after the Gunners defeated Watford at Emirates. Two goals from Smith Rowe and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gave Arteta’s men the victory over Newcastle. “I’m pleased for him [Arteta] because he had to find a way,” Wright told the BBC. “He brought the young guys in and with their enthusiasm and energy [they have improved]. “And obviously Emile Smith Rowe’s quality in that area of the field where we haven’t got too many players in there that can do what he does links the play. It coincided with the wins. “He’s finished the game today with the team that’s probably been involved in those wins, so his problem is now the depth.” Wright added: “We had Xhaka and Elneny and they are deep, they need somebody in that middle of the pitch who is on the half-turn so he can link with the midfield and the forwards. “He’s the kind of person who wants the ball in there and can then progress it forwards. “That’s what we didn’t do in the first half and what we haven’t done in the previous games to the ones we’ve won.”
