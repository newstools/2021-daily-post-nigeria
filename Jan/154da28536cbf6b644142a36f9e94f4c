A member of the civilian JTF, a police officer and another person have reportedly been gunned down by terrorists along the Maiduguri, Magumeri road in northeast Nigeria. Sources told DAILY POST that the insurgents stationed three gun trucks between Chabol and Magumeri and then fired at the military base located in that area. “After displacing the military, they attacked the police checkpoint where they burnt down one police vehicle and took one with them. There are three corpses now at the spot. A CJTF, A Police Officer and another civilian.” The source said. DAILY POST reports that this is coming on the heels of reports that the new CDS Lt. General Lucky Irabor is leading other service chiefs and top military officials to Maiduguri as they begin their assignment on the ongoing military clearance of terrorist elements in the region. Recall that, the Maiduguri, Magumeri road is where terrorists attacked exploration workers and staff of the University of Maiduguri killing 69 people in July 2017. There are speculations that the incident may be one of part of the attacks the Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau talked about in a ten minutes audio released last week.
