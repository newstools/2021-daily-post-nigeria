According to the comedian, the incident would have been handled differently if they were blacks. His post read: “Two completely different America’s that we are living in. If these people were black they would have all been shot dead. “This shit is past the word ‘sad’ at this point it is pure disrespect to all people of color. Why can’t we see this situation handled the same way that we have seen our people handled repeatedly. “When the armed officers are supposed to use force they don’t. This is f*cking SAD!!”
