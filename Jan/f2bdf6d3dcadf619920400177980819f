The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has warned the new Commissioner of Police in Oyo State, Mrs Ngozi Onadeko to resign now rather than arrest Sunday Igboho. Kanu made the call in response to the arrest of Igboho over his quit notice to herdsmen. The IPOB leader, in a statement, warned Onadeko to ensure nothing happens to Igboho and Yoruba youths rising up against herdsmen. He said: “You are an Igbo woman so I expect you to be reasonable enough to know that Fulani IGP posted you to Oyo to superintend the arrest or possible killing of Yoruba youths in order to ferment enmity between the East and the West at this critical juncture in the history of the liberation of all indigenous peoples across Nigeria, including you and your family. “I will advise you to resign honourably from your position as a certain Yoruba CP did in Abia State when he declined to order men under his command to open fire on IPOB protesters. “I am warning you not to do anything likely to jeopardise the safety or well-being of Sunday Ighoho otherwise you and your family will have the might of IPOB to contend with. “The silly game you people always play will no longer wash with us. Suddenly Fulani has realised that appointing an Igbo woman as Police Commissioner is a good thing because they want to use you. Nothing should happen to Igboho.”
