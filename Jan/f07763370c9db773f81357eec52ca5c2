Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has revealed the secret behind Bruno Fernandes free-kick goal against Liverpool in the FA Cup 4th round clash on Sunday. The match between the arch rivals ended 3-2 at Old Trafford, with Mohamed Salah scoring twice for Liverpool and Mason Greenwood, Marcus Rushford and Bruno Fernandes scoring for United. Fernandes produced a moment of magic to win the game with a sublime free-kick after he came off the bench. And the United boss was impressed but not surprised by the winning strike. “Great goal, good free-kick,” he beamed. “The thing is when you leave him out, like I had to do this time… I think he stayed about 45 minutes after training yesterday shooting free-kicks, so I was quite confident he was going to hit the target. “If he’s starting the day after the final training session, I always send him in, he’s never allowed to practice too much. Yesterday he stayed out and it worked.”
