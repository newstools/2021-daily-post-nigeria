A total of 17 persons were said to have been kidnapped by armed bandits in three communities of Bassa/Kukoki wards in Shiroro local government area of Niger State. They were allegedly abducted on Saturday night in Madagwa, Wongo and Marenje areas of the council. DAILY POST gathered that the bandits attacked the three communities at different times that night. Eyewitness accounts said five people were kidnapped each from Wongo and Marenje villages, as well as seven others from Madagwa. Confirming the kidnap, the Co-convener, Concerned Shiroro Youths, Sani Abubakar Yusuf Kokki said the location of the victims is still unknown. He stated, “This is so disheartening and unfortunate.
Kidnappings and other related criminal activities have become the order of the day in the entire Rafi and Shiroro local governments areas of Niger State. The locals have been left to their fate and this is very unfair to us.” Meanwhile, another 20 persons from Duguru in Madaka ward of Rafi local government who were on their way to the community market were kidnapped, last Thursday by the bandits.
