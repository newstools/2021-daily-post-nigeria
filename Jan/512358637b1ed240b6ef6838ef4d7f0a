Peter Obi, former Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential running mate, has observed a tough battle for the party ahead of the upcoming Anambra State governorship election. Obi said though PDP has the potential to win the Anambra State governorship election, it will be tough. He made the observation at the party’s South East zonal working committee in Anambra State. The former governor urged members of the party to embark on a vigorous mobilisation of support for the party at the grassroots level, ahead of the election. “PDP has the potential to win the governorship of Anambra State, but the potential does not win”, Obi said. He added that it would be a waste of resources for whoever emerged as the party’s candidate to lose the governorship election.
