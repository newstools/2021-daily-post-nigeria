Ikpeazu made this known while receiving a delegation of the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria in Abia State. The delegation led by their Registrar, Dr T. A. B. Sanusi at Government House, Umuahia visited the State for the accreditation of the Gregory University Uturu College of Medicine.

Also speaking, the State Chief Executive reaffirmed that the Government will continue to partner the Gregory University Uturu in providing all that is needed for a College of Medicine to be accredited.
