Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, has said there is no need to vaccinate 20 to 22 million residents of the state against COVID-19. Sanwo-Olu disclosed this while featuring on Channels Television programme, Sunday Politics. The governor also disclosed that his administration was engaging some companies in the production of COVID-19 vaccines for residents of the state. He said: “It is important for me to make this. We don’t have to vaccinate the 20 or 22 million population that we have. The plan is to ensure that there is a herd immunity and that typically speaks about 50 to 60 percent of your population, that is the kind of target that you really meet. “We have started a conversation with some of the vaccine manufacturers. Pfizer for example, I have made contact with them, Johnson and Johnson are not out yet, the Moderna have written to us and we have written back to them.”
