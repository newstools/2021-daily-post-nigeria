The federal government has said it will review the proposed January 18 resumption date for schools, as the country battles the second wave of COVID-19. The Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu, stated this while speaking at the briefing of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on Monday. Adamu noted the earlier resumption date of January 18 was not definite. “Today at the PTF meeting, we looked at the rising figures and decided that probably we should take another look at the date. “The January 18 resumption date is not sacrosanct as it is subject to constant review in view of prevailing epidemiological circumstances. We are reviewing it. “In view of the rising cases, today we have considered it at the meeting of the PTF. “Tomorrow, the ministry is going to take it up. So, most likely it is going to be reviewed,” Adamu said. DAILY POST reported today that the federal government may be tempted to announce another nationwide lockdown as the number of infections crossed the 100,000 mark.
