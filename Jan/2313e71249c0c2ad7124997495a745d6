A 16-year-old girl, Melojeuekun Barakat Mayowa, who accused the Ogun State Commissioner for Environment, Abiodun Abudu-Balogun of sexual harassment, appears to be making a u-turn on the case. This is as she recorded another video wherein she was seen saying there was misconception and misunderstanding between her and the commissioner. Mayowa’s video is coming few hours after the Ogun State Government announced the suspension of Abudu-Balogun to enable him cooperate fully with the investigation being carried out by the police. According to the short video, Mayowa appreciated everyone who has shown supports about the case. In a dramatic twist, she appealed that the case be allowed to rest. “I want to use this opportunity to appeal to meaningful Nigerians to please allow this matter to rest,” she said. DAILY POST reported on Saturday that the teenager, Mayowa had in a video accused the Commissioner of enticing her with money, saying he pressed her breasts and caressed her against her consent. She also said the suspended Commissioner recited some incantation as he allegedly tried to place his hand on her head. But, Abudu-Balogun has debunked the allegations, describing it as mere political blackmail. The police have since commenced investigation into the case by inviting Abudu-Balogun to Abigi police station in Ogun Waterside Local Government.
