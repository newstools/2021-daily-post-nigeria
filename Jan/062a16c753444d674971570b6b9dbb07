Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, has faulted the quit notice issued to Fulani herdsmen by the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu. Sani said the quit notice order by Akeredolu was wrong. Recall that Akeredolu had issued an ultimatum to Fulani herdsmen to vacate Ondo forest reserves. The Governor had said all unregistered herders should vacate the state’s forest reserves. But the presidency had condemned the ultimatum issued by Akeredolu. President Muhammadu Buhari’s spokesman, Garba Shehu had also called for restraint. However, the former lawmaker in a post on his Facebook wrote: “My Dear Governor Akeredolu, I’m quiet aware of the security challenges facing your state. I appreciate your efforts, but it’s outrightly and completely wrong to ask all cattle herders to leave Ondo forests. “The sins of a criminal few should not affect the law abiding and peaceful ones who have the right to live and move freely in all parts of our country. “Efforts must continue to be made to deal with those who breach the law,while and respecting and protecting the rights of the innocent.”
