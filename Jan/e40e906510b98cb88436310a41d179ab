Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard will be given more time to prove himself by the club’s board, The Guardian UK reports. The decision was reached following the Blues recent poor form. Chelsea have only managed to win just one out of their last six games in the Premier League. Questions are being asked over the former midfielder’s job at Stamford Bridge. Former PSG boss, Thomas Tuchel, who was recently sacked by the French champions has also been tauted as a replacement for Lampard. However, The Guardian reports that the 42-year-old former England midfielder will be given more time to prove himself as Chelsea boss. This is despite the club’s board being ‘increasingly concerned’ about the team’s lack of progress. But for now, at least, Lampard still has Chelsea board’s backing, with his contract set to expire in just over two years’ time.
