The Nigeria Governors Forum, NGF, has said the country could assess COVID-19 vaccine by the end of February. A communique signed by the NGF Chairman, Kayode Fayemi claimed efforts are ongoing with the World Bank to ensure Nigeria assess the vaccines. The communique was issued after a virtual meeting of state governors. Fayemi made the revelations while briefing the forum on his meeting with Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Chair of the Board of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) on the roll-out of the vaccines. Fayemi was said to have told the meeting there is an arrangement for the World Health Organisation (WHO) “to facilitate pooled procurement and the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines across developing countries. “Nigeria is among 12 countries in Africa that have indicated its readiness of the 92 qualified countries for the facility and will by end of February 2021 receive its first shipment of vaccines.”
