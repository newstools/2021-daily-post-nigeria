The Presidency has confirmed that the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, ordered the arrest of Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho. Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, claimed the order of arrest came after the activist gave Fulani in Oyo State an ultimatum to exit the state. Garba Shehu was quoted as saying this on Saturday during an interview with BBC Hausa. The BBC quoted the presidential aide as saying an order had been given to the Commissioner of Police in Oyo State, Ngozi Onadeko, to arrest Igboho immediately and transfer him to Abuja. “Garba said he just got off the telephone with the Inspector General of the Nigeria Police, who confirmed to him that he had ordered the arrest of Igboho, who is to be brought to Abuja,” the BBC said. “Igboho is among topics that have generated public discussion on social media in Nigeria on Friday since he visited Igangan in Ibarapa Local Government (of Oyo State) where he insisted that all Fulani residents in Oyo State must leave as long as kidnapping continues. A Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho, on Saturday made good his threat to expel Fulanis from Igangan in Oyo State. Igangan is a community in Ibarapa North Local Government Area. Last Friday, Igboho and his supporters stormed the area and gave the Fulani one week to leave.
