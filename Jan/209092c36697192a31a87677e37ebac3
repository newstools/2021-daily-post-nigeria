The Federal High Court, Lagos, will on March 1 deliver judgment in a suit on Lagos East Senatorial bye-election held on December 5, 2020. The counsels to all parties concluded their arguments on Friday. The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Babatunde Gbadamosi, dragged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Senator Adetokunbo Abiru (the winner) and the All Progressive Congress (APC) to court. They want Abiru disqualified on the grounds of alleged double voter registration, violation of section 31 of the Electoral Act, among others. In the suit filed by Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), the PDP is seeking an order of the court directing INEC to delete Abiru and APC from the list of participants in the bye-election. It is also asking for an order nullifying, cancelling and voiding the nomination, submission and acceptance of Abiru’s name as APC candidate and an order disqualifying him as a candidate in the election. INEC, Abiru and the APC contended that the case of the plaintiffs lacked merit as the candidate was duly nominated and qualified. Abiru and APC, through their counsel, Kemi Pinheiro (SAN) and Abiodun Owonikoko (SAN) raised preliminary objections to the suit, contending that the same was statute-barred and not justiciable in law. On Friday, before Justice Chuka Obiozor, all the lawyers addressed the court, adopted their respective processes and concluded arguments. The Judge adjourned the case until March 1 to deliver judgment.
