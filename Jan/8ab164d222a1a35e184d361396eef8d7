Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello has called for the same penalty to be meted out on informants of armed bandits and kidnappers alike in the country. Bello, who stated this at the swearing-in of the new Chief Judge of the state, Justice Aisha Bwari at the council chamber in government house, Minna said the informants are even more dangerous and when caught should be given severe punishment. He noted that without the informants, the bandits and kidnappers will not be able to conduct their criminal activities. Expressing concern over the rising tide of bandit activities, Bello stated, “it has come to our notice that most of these heinous crimes are being executed by members of the communities, in most cases, they are the ones that invite the bandits. I am seriously suggesting that kidnappers, bandits and informants receive the same punishments. “Without informants, bandit activities will become extremely difficult. In my opinion, the informants are more dangerous than bandits. They have deprived people of their livelihood and at the same time, they have deprived people of their lives.” The governor then called on the Judiciary and Legislature to come up with stiffer penalties for those involved in the criminal activities. ” An example needs to be set for those involved in these activities. I will meet up with the state Assembly on the steps to take to ensure this and I hope the judiciary will execute whatever amendment is made.” Reacting, the new Chief Judge of Niger State, Justice Aisha Bwari assured the governor that there would be a change in the judiciary saying, ” the judiciary will work in tandem with the executive and legislature to execute laws for the good of the state.”
