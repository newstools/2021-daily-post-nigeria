Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has reacted to his victory at the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Saturday. DAILY POST had reported that the certificate forgery case levelled against Obaseki by the All Progressives Congress (APC) was dismissed by the court. Obaseki while commending the ruling said the judgement is a triumph of the rule of law and a testament to the fact that truth will prevail ultimately. “It is the needless attempt by desperate individuals, trying to undo the will of the people through the backdoor, but we are happy today that justice and truth have prevailed,’’ he said. Obaseki further promised to continue to prioritize the development of the state adding that the verdict confirmed, once again, that the people of Edo State were well-guided in trusting him to lead them in the September 2020 governorship election. “My profound gratitude goes to the judiciary who have stood indefatigably for truth and justice and the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari.’’ Obaseki also thanked the People’s Democratic Party, the party leaders and members as well as his teeming supporters and people of Edo State for standing with him
