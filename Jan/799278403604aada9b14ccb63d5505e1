Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has issued a warning to Tottenham after the Reds crashed out of the FA Cup to Manchester United on Sunday. Liverpool’s next opponents will be Jose Mourinho’s side and Klopp believes the United outing has set his side in the right mood to face the north Londoners The German said Liverpool will learn lessons from their 3-2 defeat against Manchester United, ahead of facing Tottenham in midweek. Liverpool’s poor recent run of results continued as they were knocked out of the FA Cup at the fourth round stage by their greatest rivals. This means that Liverpool have lost three of their last five games in all competitions, with Klopp’s side yet to score in the Premier League this year. The Premier League champions are currently lying in fourth position in the League as a result, six points behind United. Klopp said that he feels his side can draw on the experience of facing United and the threats that they posed in counter attacks, ahead of a clash away to Spurs. “There were a lot of positives in the game. The start was really positive, fully in the game,” he told beIN Sports after the game at Old Trafford. “It was a good test tonight for our next opponent, we play Tottenham and they, obviously, are not too bad in counter-attacking as well,” he said. “So yeah, we should do better, but I know that the boys will do it better.”
