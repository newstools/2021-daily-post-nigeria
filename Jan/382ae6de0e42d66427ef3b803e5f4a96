Governor Nyesom Wike has blamed mischief makers for viral 2023 presidential campaign posters spotted in some parts of Abuja. Wike disassociated himself from the campaign posters in a statement issued by the Rivers State Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim. DAILY POST reports that campaign posters of Wike with the inscription, ”Rescue Nigeria 2023 from Insecurity, poverty, bandits and killing, were seen on Herbert Macaulay Road, FCT Abuja. However, Nsirim maintained that Wike is presently preoccupied with his mission to make Rivers State a better place and destination of choice. He said “For the avoidance of doubt, Governor Wike has not informed anyone that he is interested in the Presidency of this country. “This is certainly the handiwork of mischief makers threatened by the Governor’s rising political profile. We are amused that political detractors will stop at nothing to see how they can distract Governor Wike’s visionary leadership. Nsirim while advising Nigerians to discountenance the misinformation added that the antics of political jobbers aimed at heating up the polity will surely fail.
