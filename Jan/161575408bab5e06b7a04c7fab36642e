The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has resumed the enrolment services of the National Identification Number, NIN, across the country. NIMC Director-General of NIMC, Engr. Aliyu Aziz, urged workers of the corporation to go about their duty of enrolment. Recall that some staff members of NIMC had on Wednesday embarked on an industrial action due to poor working condition. But, Aziz disclosed that the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami intervened in the matter. He said Pantami promised to look into the workers grievances and advised them to empathise with Nigerians especially at this time that linkage of the NIN with the Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) cards is ongoing for the security of lives and property in the country. A statement by Kayode Adegoke, NIMC’s Head of Corporate Communication reads: “The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) is glad to inform the general public that normal enrolment services for the National Identification Number (NIN) have been fully restored at all NIMC offices nationwide as the glitches experienced since January 6, 2021, have been sorted out. “Enrolment services were temporarily disrupted when the local chapter of the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN) of NIMC embarked on an industrial action on Wednesday, 6 January, 2021 immediately after their congress.” While thanking Nigerians for their understanding in the face of the challenges posed by the two-day hiatus in enrolment, Aziz stressed his management’s avowed pursuit of the welfare and health of all staff of the Commission across the country. Aziz who enjoined the staff to go about their normal duties, while fully observing the COVID-19 protocols as they enroll Nigerians, also assured that more Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) would be made available to staff, in addition to those already donated by the World Bank, which had since been distributed to all NIMC offices nationwide.
