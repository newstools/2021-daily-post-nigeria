The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said over 24,000 children are yet to resume in the state. Sanwo-Olu stated this on Tuesday, briefing newsmen at the State House, Ikeja on the COVID-19 update. The Governor explained that one of the reasons for reopening schools was to protect students from social vices. He said, “After the first lockdown, we are still looking for about 24,000 children that are yet to come back to school. “So, there is a challenge if you keep them out for that long. Their parents or guardians now turn them to other things instead of allowing them to come back and learn. “We believe that schools, sometimes, happen to be the safe haven for them and we have done a roaster.”
