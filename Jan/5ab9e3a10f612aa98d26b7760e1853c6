Frank Lampard’s position as Chelsea boss looks increasingly in danger, as it is believed that a number of key players have lost faith in him. The Blues have lost four of their last six fixtures in the Premier League. Their miserable form continued last Sunday, as Manchester City blew them away 3-1 at Stamford Bridge. Lampard was backed heavily in the summer transfer market but despite a promising start, things have turned sour. According to ESPN, senior Chelsea players have vented their frustrations over Lampard’s regime due to two key reasons. Firstly, it is reported that his tactics are beginning to frustrate them. The Blues operated in his preferred 4-3-3 formation against City. The players are also angry that he failed to determine his best team. This struggle is essentially down to Lampard’s failure to get the best out of their two costly German imports. Timo Werner has gone 12 matches without finding the net while the £70m signing Kai Havertz has been in and out of the side and has been way below his best.
