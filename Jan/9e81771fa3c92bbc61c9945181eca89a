The Federal High Court Ikoyi, Lagos State, on Wednesday, admitted more evidence against Azeez Fashola, popular musician also known as Naira Marley. Naira Marley was arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC for offences bordering on conspiracy and credit card fraud. He pleaded “not guilty” to the 11 counts filed against him. The EFCC had on February 28, 2020, through its second witness, Augustine Anosike, sought to tender in evidence a compact disc containing information, analysis and extractions from the defendant’s iPhone. The defence counsel, Olalekan Ojo, SAN had objected to its admissibility, which was equally opposed by the prosecution. In his ruling, Justice Nicholas Oweibo dismissed the objection, noting that “the disk and investigation report include some of the contents extracted from the iPhone which has already been admitted in evidence”. Thereafter, prosecuting counsel, Bilikisu Buhari, informed the Court that the prosecution was ready to continue with the case as the witness was in court to continue with his testimony. The case was adjourned following the plea by one of the defence lawyers, Akinwale Kole-Taiwo. Kole-Taiwo appealed with the Court for an adjournment because, “the lead counsel, Ojo, was in Edo for another matter”. Following the appeal, Justice Oweibo adjourned till March 8 and 11, 2021 for “continuation of hearing”.
