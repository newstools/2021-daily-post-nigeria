Award-winning Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has said Catholicism in Nigeria is about money, thanksgiving, and fundraising. According to her, this is one of the other reasons that made her stop attending Catholic churches in Nigeria. The 43-year-old novelist made this known during an interview with media personality, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu. She, however, noted that she still considers herself a Catholic and only attends masses outside Nigeria when she comes across a “progressive” Catholic community that upholds humanity. “I grew up as a Catholic. Catholicism was very important to me. It‘s almost like a culture, not just a religion. So even if you leave the Catholic Church, it’s in you. “At the moment, I don’t like to talk about religion because I don’t know. There are so many rules about religion, It teaches you guilt in a way that I don’t think so many protestant denominations do. “I’m Catholic, nominally but I do not attend it in Nigeria. “Nigerian Catholicism is way too much about money, fundraising, and thanksgiving. Some in the east even look at who’s wearing gold. I think the focus of religion should be things Nigerian Catholicism doesn’t focus on. “Culturally, I call myself a Catholic but if being religious means performing and going to confession, then I’m not. “I go to church outside the country when I find a progressive Catholic Church,” Chimamanda added. She, however, noted that she respects religion in general but questions some of its excesses.
