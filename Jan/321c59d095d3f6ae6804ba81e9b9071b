Joe Biden has been sworn in as the 46th United States President. Biden took his oath of office on Wednesday at the Capitol in Washington D.C. Chief Justice, John Roberts Jr, administered the pledge at exactly 11:48am ET. Kamala Harris did the same before him after the national anthem rendition by Lady Gaga. Harris becomes the Vice President. She is Americaâ€™s first female, first Black and Asian-American person to hold the office. As expected, former President Donald Trump was absent. Mike Pence, the former Vice President, fulfilled his promise to attend. Former Presidents Bill Clinton, George Bush Jr, Barack Obama and their wives attended.
