The Department of State Services (DSS), on Tuesday, said it is not currently recruiting. Dr Peter Afunanya, Public Relations Officer of the service, announced this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. He noted that the clarification became necessary, following desperate efforts by fraudsters to scam unsuspecting job seekers or their sponsors. He noted that recruitment into the service is never done on monetary basis but guided by merit and transparency. â€œBeneficiaries undergo a series of screening and vetting processes and procedures through which only the best, produced by these, is taken. He advised the public against falling into the hands of fraudsters and report any suspicion in connection to the said recruitment to the service. Afunanya further warned perpetrators of the false recruitment alert to desist from the act or be ready to face the music.
