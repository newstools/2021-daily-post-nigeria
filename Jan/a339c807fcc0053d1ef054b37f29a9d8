Days after the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association (MACBAN), accepted the demands of the Ondo State Government to stop open and night grazing, some herders have led their cows to destroy some farms in Idanre, headquarters of Idanre Local Government Area of Ondo State. While counting their losses, the farmers who had arrived at their farms for the day’s farming activities said the herders perpetrated the act in the midnight. With crops worth millions of naira eaten and destroyed by the cows, farmers at Obasooto farm settlement where the incident happened, said all their sweat and labour had vanished due to what they described as the wickedness of the herders. According to one of the farmers, Mr. Friday Ayaghi stated, his cassava plantation which he had been cultivating for a while was eaten and destroyed by the cows. While lamenting that all his money was invested on the plantation, Ayaghi said all the plans he made in hope of reaping gains from his produce have gone to ruins. For Pa Olatuja Idowu, a physically challenged octogenarian, it was the same tale as his farm and that of his wife which had cassava, pineapples, plantains and cocoyam were all destroyed by the herdsmen and their cows. According to Idowu, the herdsmen first attacked his wife’s farm about ten days ago but came again to destroy his farm and the rest of his wife’s farm. When contacted over the development, the Commander of Amotekun in the state, Adetunji Adeleye, who confirmed the incident disclosed that operatives of the corps had been deployed to the affected farms to ascertain the level of the destruction as well as quantify the damage done. The Amotekun boss also stated that the Chairman of MACBAN in the state had been invited towards identifying and apprehending herders who committed the crime.
