Paris Saint-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has said Lionel Messi is welcome at the club. Pochettino only took charge of the Ligue 1 champions last week, after Thomas Tuchel was sacked. He already has Kylian Mbappe and Neymar in his attack, alongside Angel Di Maria. However, with Messi’s future still unclear at Barcelona, there are speculations he could leave for either PSG or Manchester City. “We leave the rumours aside. All great players are welcome at PSG,” Pochettino told a press conference. “Father Christmas has been generous with me, I take this opportunity to thank President Nasser [Al-Khelaifi] and [sporting director] Leonardo for the trust and to be in this great club and back in this house. “It’s one of the biggest clubs, if not the biggest in the world, so it’s normal that there are rumours. We have just arrived so we leave them aside.”
