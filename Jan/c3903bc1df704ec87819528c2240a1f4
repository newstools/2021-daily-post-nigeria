Gorillas at the San Diego Zoo in California have tested positive for coronavirus. The test was conducted using faecal samples after great apes began coughing. The zoo management, on Monday, said they are quarantine together. “Aside from some congestion and coughing, the gorillas are doing well,” said Lisa Peterson, the executive director. The animals are believed to have contracted the disease from an asymptomatic employee. The zoo has been closed to visitors since December.
