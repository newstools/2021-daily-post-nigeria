Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) says a driver scared of arrest fatally knocked down its officer. In a statement on Thursday, LASTMA General Manager, Olajide Oduyoye, gave the name of the deceased as Samson Olawale Akinmade. The incident occurred on Tuesday in Mile 12, Ketu. Akinmade died on Wednesday at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH). Oduyoye said the driver of a blue-black Opel Space Bus with registration number AAA 74 GG knocked down the officer at Demurin Street junction inwards Mile 12 while controlling traffic, leaving him with head and body injuries. The GM said Akinmade was directing yellow buses away from the Demurin Street Junction checkpoint and approached the motorist to park away from the road to pick passengers. “The driver assumed that he would be apprehended for obstructing traffic and sped off, knocking down the officer against the concrete culvert on the service lane and dragging him for about seven metres. “He tried to escape through a street which turned out to be closed but was eventually arrested and handed over to the Police at Alapere along with his vehicle”, he explained. Oduyoye commiserated with Akinmade’s family, the Ministry of Transportation and LASTMA. He vowed that the government will ensure that the driver is apprehended and prosecuted in accordance with the law. Oduyoye warned motorists to desist from violating the State Traffic Laws in order to prevent accidents and deaths on Lagos roads.
