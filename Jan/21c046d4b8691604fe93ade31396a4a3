Jigawa State High Court sitting in Ringim has sentenced the father of a four-year-old girl to death for burying her alive. Justice Ahmed Mohammed Kazaure said Nasiru Hamisu was accused of killing his 4-year-old biological daughter Zainab and burying her alive in his room. Prosecution counsel, Dr. Musa Adamu Aliyu, Attorney General Jigawa State presented three witnesses before the court, including a medical doctor at Ringim General Medical Hospital, defendantâ€™s father and the mother of the deceased and ex-wife of the defendant. Police had last year arrested one Nasiru Hamisu for allegedly killing his daughter and burying her in a shallow grave in his house. Justice Ahmad Muhammad Kazaure, however, said the persecution counsel had proved his case beyond a reasonable doubt.
He sentenced the accused to death by hanging.
