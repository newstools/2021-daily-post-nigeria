The Sultan of Sokoto, Abubakar Sa’ad Abubakar has commended President Muhammadu Buhari on “successes” in the North-East. Abubakar is the President of the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA). The revered monarch, regarded as head of Muslims in Nigeria, spoke on Thursday when he led a NSCIA delegation to Buhari at the State House. He urged the government to deal decisively with the banditry in Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto and some parts of the North Central. Abubakar expressed confidence that security forces, with better synergy, would overcome present challenges. He urged governors to cooperate with the federal government irrespective of their political leanings, and urged Nigerians to support the new leadership of the armed forces. The traditional ruler appealed to religious leaders and citizens to refrain from making inflammatory comments that sow discord in the polity. Barely nine weeks ago, the Sultan declared the North unsafe. Abubakar described the region as the worst place to live in Nigeria. At a meeting of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) in Abuja, he decried how bandits move about freely with guns. He said: “Security situation in northern Nigeria has assumed a worrisome situation. People think the North is safe, but that assumption is not true. In fact, it’s the worst place to be in this country. “Bandits go around in the villages, households and markets with their AK 47 and nobody is challenging them. They stop at the market, buy things, pay and collect change, with their weapons openly displayed. These are facts I know because I am at the centre of it.”
