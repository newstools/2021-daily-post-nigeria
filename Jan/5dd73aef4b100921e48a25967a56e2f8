Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has reacted to the change of Service Chiefs. Kanu said the new Service Chiefs will soon prove their inability to stop Boko Haram, killer herdsmen and ISWAP terrorists. In a tweet, the IPOB leader said the new Service Chiefs may tolerate the extra-judicial killings of unarmed activists in the Southeast. “It will surely get worse because your new Service Chiefs will soon prove unwilling and unable to stop BokoHaram, herdsmen and ISWAP while at the same time tolerating the extrajudicial killing of UNARMED activists in the South, especially in Southeast, as in the ongoing #OrluMassacre,” he tweeted. President Muhammadu Buhari had on Tuesday approved the resignation of the outgoing Service Chiefs. The president had commended them while accepting the immediate resignation of the Service Chiefs and their retirement from service. Following their resignation, the president immediately appointed Maj Gen LEO Irabor, CDS, Maj Gen I Attahiru, Army, Rear Adm AZ Gambo, Navy, AVM IO Amao, Air Force
