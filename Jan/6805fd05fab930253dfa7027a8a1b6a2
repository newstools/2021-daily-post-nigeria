Chelsea defender, Thiago Silva, has urged his teammates to give their ‘blood and sweat’ ahead of their FA Cup fourth-round tie with Luton Town on Sunday at Stamford Bridge. Silva also urged Chelsea players not to give up on their objectives for this season. The former PSG star wants Frank Lampard’s men to give more effort, determination, courage and dedication in order to win matches for the Blues going forward. The Brazilian international was part of Chelsea’s squad that lost 2-0 against Leicester City in the Premier League on Tuesday night at the King Power Stadium. “Nobody said it would be easy. To win in life, it takes a lot of effort, many hours of dedication, determination and a lot of courage,” Silva wrote on Instagram on Wednesday. “That’s why we are not going to give up. Nothing happens by chance, and everything has a purpose. It takes delivery, sweat and a lot of work to achieve the goals—we will@chelseafc. “Nobody said it was going to be easy.
