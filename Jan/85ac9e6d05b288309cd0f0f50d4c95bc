Former England striker, Michael Owen, has played down Manchester United’s title chances after they moved joint-top of the Premier League. United defeated Aston Villa 2-1 on Friday night to join champions Liverpool at the top of the table on 33 points. Owen still doubts the Red Devils will win the title and says Liverpool and Manchester City remain a level above Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. Speaking after the Villa victory, Owen was asked whether United could win the title without in-form Bruno Fernandes and said: “I’m not sure they can win the title with him to be honest. “I still think they’re… I think they’re a brilliant counter-attacking team, against the bigger and better teams they are exceptional and can give anyone a problem. “The question I have is when they’re in possession against teams like Wolves and trying to break them down.”
