Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has claimed he does not think Frank Lampard wants to speak with him, just after being sacked as Chelsea boss. Mourinho stated this after they booked their place in the FA Cup fifth round, following a 4-1 win at Wycombe. The match came just hours after Lampard was dismissed at Stamford Bridge after 18 months in charge. Lampard played under Mourinho at Stamford Bridge from 2004-2007 and then again in 2013, winning two Premier League titles, two Carabao Cups, an FA Cup and a Community Shield together. Mourinho himself has been sacked twice at Chelsea. “I don’t think Frank wants to speak to me or with anyone apart from his close circle of family and friends,” Mourinho said. “But I am always sad when a colleague loses his job and Frank is not just a colleague. He is an important person in my career so I feel sorry he did. “But it is the brutality of football, especially modern football, so when you become a manager, you know that sooner or later it is going to happen to you.”
