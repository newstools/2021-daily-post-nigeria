An Igbo socio-political organization, Igbo National Council, INC, has condemned the clash between soldiers and operatives of the Eastern Security network, ESN, in Orlu area of Imo State. The Igbo group called on Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State to quickly intervene on the ongoing violent conflict between the Nigerian Military and the ESN, so as to halt the wanton destruction of lives and properties of the people of the area. INC’s call is contained in a release signed by its President, Chilos Godsent and made available to DAILY POST on Tuesday morning. DAILY POST reports that the clash between ESN and soldiers had allegedly led to the death of one person, while scores were wounded in okporo, Orlu area of Imo State. The clash was said to have occurred during a military operation in the community suspected to be the operational base of ESN, set up the Mazi Nnamdi Kanu-led Indigneous People of Biafra, (IPOB). The igbo socio-political organization also urged the Federal Government of Nigeria to immediately redeploy the soldiers ravaging Orlu Communities to the various highways where the Fulani herdsmen are presently terrorizing, raping and killing Nigerians. According to the release by INC, “It may not be to the best interest of the Imo State and Federal Government of Nigeria to militarize any part of the Igbo Nation in disguise of fighting pro-Biafra agitators. “We note that the Nigerian Police has the capacity to tackle criminalities in any part of Nigeria well mobilized and given free hand to operate. “We fear that if the ongoing violent conflict is not quickly resolved, it might escalate to other communities in Imo State”. In the same vein, Governor Hope Uzodinma has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the crisis-ridden Orlu LGA and neighbouring communities including Nkwerre, Ideato South, Ideato North, Njaba and Isu. The Governor expressed concern at the increasing level of killings in the area.
