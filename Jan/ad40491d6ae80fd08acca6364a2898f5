Vice President Yemi Osinbajo says that the Buhari administration’s vision to lift at least 20 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next two years is within reach. He spoke on Tuesday in Abuja during the virtual flag off of the cash transfer scheme to be facilitated through a technology-based Rapid Response Register (RRR). Through RRR, urban poor and vulnerable populations can be speedily identified using geographic satellite technology and other related means. The federal government said the purpose is to deliver cash to households affected by the fallouts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. Osinbajo said the RRR has emboldened the administration to achieve its aspiration of a social security programme for a minimum of twenty million Nigerians in the next two years. “This will be the largest of its kind on the continent. This (aspiration) is, at least from the perspective of this tested approach, now well within our reach.” He listed the only constraint as the funding “which we must look at”. “This country deserves a social security scheme that will not merely alleviate poverty but also create wealth for the millions of those who are waiting for this opportunity”, Osinbajo added.
