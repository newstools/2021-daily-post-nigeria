The Plateau State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) has announced February 1 as resumption date for academic activities in all public primary schools across the state. The Chairman of the board, Prof. Mathew Sule, made the announcement in a statement made available to NAN in Jos on Saturday. Sule explained that the directive was in tune with the government’s directives for the resumption of schools across the state. “By this directive, all the acting Education Secretaries in the 17 Local Government Areas of the state should work in conjunction with head teachers and union leaders to mobilise parents to send their children to school by February 1. “Head teachers are to ensure both teachers and students adhere strictly to the safety protocols put in place by the government against COVID-19. “Head teachers should ensure that the third term academic work is completed and all outstanding examinations are conducted and the results forwarded to the board,” Sule said. The Chairman also directed head teachers to open a register for staff in their various schools and ensure they remain at work until closing hours.
