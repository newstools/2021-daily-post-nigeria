The Nigerian Customs Service has announced that a slash on imported vehicle duties will begin next week. The Comptroller-General of Customs, Hameed Ali made this known during an interview with newsmen on Tuesday. Ali said that the service is expecting an official communication from the Finance Ministry on the matter. According to him, the vehicle tariff reduction is contained in the 2020 Finance Act and initiated by the NCS to ease the cost of transportation in Nigeria. “I have been torn apart by many people criticizing the new tariff, saying I used my connection to get it done but this is in the interest of Nigeria. “However, it is now a law and we are only waiting for the finance minister to give us a formal conveyance of that Act. “Once it is released, we will commence full implementation immediately. “We are only hoping that by next week, it will become operational,” he said.
