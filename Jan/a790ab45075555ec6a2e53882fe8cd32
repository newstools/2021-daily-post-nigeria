The All Progressives Congress has called on US President Donald Trump to emulate President Muhammadu Buhari. The Nigeria’s ruling party said this in a statement on Sunday by John Akpanudoedehe, the Publicity Secretary of the party’s Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee. The statement was entitled, ‘The integrity of a leader is as important as strong institutions’. The APC faulted President Trump for refusing to concede defeat and condemned the US Capitol Hill riot by pro-Trump protesters. The party noted that the US elections have always served as example to other nations, wondering what the country has turned out in the past 72hrs. “President Muhammadu Buhari contested and lost elections a couple of times and followed the process through to the Supreme Court on all accounts. This is an outstanding credential of a true democrat. “Upon ultimately gaining victory in 2015, the APC-led administration has carried out fundamental reforms to strengthen our institutions. “For instance, non-interference in the functions of INEC. The APC has contested elections; won some, lost some without splitting hairs. In fact, at some point, the APC lost over 5 states to the PDP, yet we allowed democracy to prevail. We have remained resolute in our belief that in every electoral contest, popular will must prevail,” it said.
