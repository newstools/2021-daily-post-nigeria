John Nwodo, immediate past President of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has said there was no clean copy of the constitution in 1999 when former President Olusegun Obasanjo was inaugurated. Nwodo, who was a former Minister of Information said no member of the Federal Executive Council saw a copy of the constitution. Speaking on Thursday, the former Ohanaeze President claimed the inauguration of the National Assembly was delayed in 1999 due to the lack of a clean copy of the constitution. He said: “I was Minister of Information and it was my responsibility to publicise the constitution. “I never saw a copy of it and never knew who was printing it. “The National Assembly could not be inaugurated until four days after the President’s inauguration because there was no clean copy of the constitution.”
