Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, has reacted to the arrest of a former presidential candidate, Omoyele Sowore. Sowore was arrested alongside other activists during a protest against the Nigerian government in the early hours of Friday. The protest was organized in Abuja. According to Sahara Reporters, police officers attacked and arrested the protesters during a peaceful procession to mark the New Year in Abuja. Reacting, Sani, in a tweet via his Twitter account on Friday, described Sowore’s arrest as unhelpful to the nation’s image. “The case of @YeleSowore; it’s unhelpful to the nation’s image and its constitutional democracy when peaceful protesters are treated in the most cruel and uncivilized manner by the state apparatuses. “The new year’s door is opened with a hammer instead of the key,” Sani tweeted. —
