Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has commented on Kai Havertz, Timo Werner and Billy Gilmour, following the Blues’ FA Cup third-round 4-0 win over Morecambe on Sunday at Stamford Bridge. Lampard urged Chelsea and its fans to be patient with Havertz’s performances for the club. He also said that he was pleased with Werner’s display against Morecambe, while Gilmour would be a very good player for the West London club. Four goals from Mason Mount, Timo Werner, Callum Hudson-Odoi, and Kai Havertz gave Lampard’s men the victory against Morecambe. “We have to remain patient with Kai but he has levels that he can go up,” Lampard told post-match press conference after the game. He added: “I think Billy is pushing and I think he’s been pushing since Liverpool last season. I know Billy will be a very good player for this club “I’m pleased for him [Werner] because strikers want to score goals.” Chelsea’s next match is against Fulham in the Premier League on Friday.
