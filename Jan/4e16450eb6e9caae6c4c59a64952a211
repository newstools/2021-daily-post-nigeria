Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has said he was not surprised that Sheffield United defeated Manchester United 2-1 in the Premier League because it was extremely difficult to beat any team in the English top-flight league. Arteta said this on Thursday during his pre-match press conference ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Manchester United on Saturday at the Emirates Stadium. Recall that Sheffield United defeated Man United on Wednesday night at Old Trafford, following goals from Kean Bryan and Oliver Burke as Harry Maguire’s header was not enough to give Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men a point against the visitors. “It is not a surprise [that Sheffield defeated Man United] because to beat any team in this league is extremely difficult and people take it for granted,” Arteta said. “Sheffield United are a really well-organised team, they are a threat, and they are good at what they do. “They lost many games by one goal, where they didn’t deserve to lose. “Every game is a challenge in this league and anybody can beat anybody, and with the context and circumstances we have this season, it makes it even more difficult.”
