President Muhammadu Buhari, on Thursday, in Abuja, reiterated his commitment to lift 100million Nigerians out of poverty. He charged the National Commission for Persons with Disabilities to play its roles in the realisation. Buhari gave the charge when he received members of the newly-established body at the State House. “I am enjoining you as a team of the commission, to realize that your work forms a critical aspect in achieving the objective of our Administration to remove 100 million Nigerians out of poverty.” The Nigerian leader said he looks forward to commissioning projects and programmes of high impact to the disabled community. Buhari told the commission to work diligently towards ensuring that the government is able to touch the lives of fellow citizens with special needs. The President assured that his administration will continue to give effect to treaties that give inclusivity to persons with disabilities. Buhari added that under his leadership, the government shall continue to give effect to all global, regional and sub-regional treaties that seek to improve the lives of disadvantaged citizens. Nigeria is a signatory and a state party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which seeks to promote the inclusion of persons with special needs in all development efforts globally.
