Most Rev. Dr. Ignatius Kaigama, Archbishop of Abuja Catholic Archdiocese, has condemned the incessant kidnapping of catholic priests and ministers of God in Nigeria. Kaigama, in his homily on Sunday at St. Anthony’s Parish, Yangoji, Abuja, described the kidnapping of priests as molestation of the church. He says such acts are criminal, ungodly and degrading to humanity. Kaigama, who spoke at a mass to mark Solemnity of Baptism of the Lord, said it should be clear to the kidnappers that the mission of the Catholic Church was to bring good news to the needy and poor. “Whatever may be the motive of the kidnappers, monetary or sheer intimidation, it should be clear to those engaged in such nefarious activities that the Catholic Church brings good news to the poor through huge sacrifices. “She complements the government’s efforts through her selfless social, educational and medical services to the needy, so molesting the Church is molesting the needy. “Whatever the Catholic Church has and does, is for the good of all, irrespective of religious, ethnic or political differences,” he said. He prayed for the release of those who are still in captivity and for the conversion of the perpetrators of the inhuman act. “May Christ manifest Himself to the perpetrators of such evil actions as kidnapping, rape, killings, etc and grant them a change of heart,’’ he said. Kaigama encouraged Parishioners to persevere more in faith and not to give in to despair with the happenings around them, especially in the light of the kidnap of their parish priest. DAILY POST recalls that the Parish Priest, Rev. Fr. Matthew Dajo was kidnapped for 10 days, before his release in Dec. 2, 2020. His kidnap is one of many incidents recorded in the past few months.
