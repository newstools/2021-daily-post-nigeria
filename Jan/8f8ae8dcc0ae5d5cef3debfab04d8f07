Non-teaching staff in Nigerian public universities will commence a nationwide strike from February 15, 2021. The workers are opposed to the Federal Government’s handling of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS). They are protesting the sharing formula of the N40billion earned academic allowances and non-payment of arrears of the new minimum wage. The workers are under the Joint Action Committee (JAC) umbrella. JAC affiliate unions are the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU) and the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU). Last week, they held a three-day demonstration over the government’s failure to respect the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with them on October 20. The unions kicked against what they termed inconsistencies in IPPIS payment and the delay in the renegotiation of the FGN/ ASUU/SSANU 2009 Agreement. Others are non-payment of retirement benefits to former members, non-constitution of visitation panels to universities, poor funding of universities and teaching staff usurping the leadership of non-teaching units.
