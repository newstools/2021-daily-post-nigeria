President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, said his administration is working to sort out the debts they owe Super Eagles players and coaches. Pinnick admitted the federation was dealing with financial challenges amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Although salaries and allowances of national coaches have been slashed, coach Gernot Rohr is being owed five months salary. Goalkeeper coach, Alloy Agu, is waiting for 22 months unpaid wages, while the Super Eagles stars have not yet received their bonuses and allowances for 19 months. “With the pandemic and challenges facing oil companies, things have been tough for our sponsors Aiteo, who are responsible for the payment of coaches,” Pinnick told BBC Sport. “But we’ve moved to pay Alloy [Agu] nine months of his wages from what we have left and coach Gernot too will be sorted. We don’t want to owe and that is the mentality in which I came into the NFF. “There are circumstances beyond our control. It is not a good thing to owe and we don’t like the image it creates. “We are looking at every means not to owe. The toxic atmosphere has really affected our sponsorship drive but we can’t give excuses. “We are working religiously and assiduously to resolve this as soon as possible. “It’s a kind of government responsibility to pay the players and the [Nigerian] president is very keen on helping to sort it. “I was in Abuja and I found out it’s only a matter of the modalities delaying paying the allowances and bonuses, any moment from now it will be sorted out.”
