Kaduna State Government has confirmed the killing of a cleric in Igabi, and a community leader in Jema’a LGA, Kaduna state. Confirming the incidents on Saturday, Commissioner, Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Kaduna State, Mr. Samuel Aruwan said, the security agents informed the Kaduna State Government that armed bandits invaded Kawaran Rafi village in Igabi local government area, and killed one Danleeman Isah, the Chief Imam of the village. According to the statement, the bandits moved straight to Isah’s residence, and in what appears to be a pre-meditated murder, shot him dead and left the location without taking any items or hostages. “The murder of the cleric has been linked to his vocal stance against the killing and kidnapping of citizenry by bandits. “It is of a similar ilk to the killing of Ardo Musa Layi of Kajuru local government, who was kidnapped and killed by armed bandits in October 2020 for his advocacy against killing, kidnapping and cattle rustling. “Also similar was the shooting of Ardo Ahmadu Suleiman by bandits at Kasuwan Magani, Kajuru local government, leaving him with bullet wounds,” the statement further said In another development, security agencies have reported the murder of the Sarkin Yaki of Godogodo, Mr Yohanna Abu, by a gang of kidnappers. “According to the report, the gunmen attacked Nisama village in Jema’a local government area late on Friday night, and abducted Mr Abu along with another resident Mr Charles Audu. “A struggle ensued between the duo and the kidnappers, and while Mr Audu was able to escape, the kidnappers shot Mr Abu dead. “Five persons have been arrested in connection with the killing, as security agencies continue to investigate the incident. “Governor Nasir El-Rufai expressed sadness at both reports, praying for the repose of the souls of the slain cleric and community leader, as he conveyed his heartfelt condolences to their families,” the statement further added.
