Femi Adesina, the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, has advised those he described as “wailing wailers,” to calm down in 2021. He said that this set of people have criticised the government for far too long, asking them to take a break in 2021. The presidential aide said that the administration of Buhari will continue its infrastructural development in every party of the country in 2021, advising
“wailers” to calm down and take a vacation. He noted that most of the ongoing projects initiated by the Buhari government fall within the first quarter of 2022, a clear year before the end of the administration. “You know what that means? 2021 is the year of work. Hard work, to deliver on the major projects by next year. Is it then a year to continue wailing? No,” he said in an article he made available to reporters marking the New Year. “It is the year to calm down. A year for wailing wailers to find a vocation, and allow government to concentrate, and deliver on projects at hand,” he added. According to Adesina, anybody who loves Nigeria must resolve to give Buhari government as less distraction as possible in 2021. “Yes, there are challenges: security, economy, improving quality of lives. Lack of jobs. Inflation.. And many others. But is it the year to wail? No. We should rather hail, encourage government to do better, and engender better standards of living for Nigerians,” he said. Adesina said he was not asking people to stop criticising the government in 2021 but that people should not take it as a full time job. “They will criticize the rail project of the government, calling it white elephant, but will be the first to hop on the trains, taking selfies in it. Wailers, calm down. “Please, ‘be calming down’ in 2021,” the presidential aide said, adding that this would enable the government function with less distractions.
