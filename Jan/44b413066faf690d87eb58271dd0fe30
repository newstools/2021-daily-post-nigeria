The Ekiti State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) has released the names of 600 newly recruited primary school teachers on the State Website. The SUBEB Chairman, Prof. Femi Akinwumi who made this known in Ado Ekiti, explained that the newly engaged teachers were the first batch to be employed from successful applicants in the recruitment exercise and documentation process carried out by SUBEB recently. Prof Akinwumi advised applicants to check the list by logging to the Ekiti State website. He said that the 600 successful applicants, as well as the already notified 100 newly recruited teachers under the Federal Teachers Scheme, would undergo a 4-day induction training workshop from Monday,18th January 2021 at designated centres across the state under strict compliance with the COVID-19 protocols recently announced by the State Government. Akinwumi added that the venues for the induction training programme and other relevant information would be made available to the successful candidates in due course. Stressing that the recruitment exercise was devoid of political, religious, ethnic or gender bias, he said that the exercise was strictly based on merit. Akinwumi, however, charged the newly recruited teachers to see their employment as a call to duty, stressing that they should judiciously utilise the opportunity given to them by being diligent, loyal and dedicated to their duties. The SUBEB boss also assured that the exercise was continuous as more successful applicants would still be employed in due course.
