Festus Keyamo, the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, has revealed that the Special Public Works Programme which would engage 774,000 unemployed Nigerians will finally kick off nationwide on Tuesday after several postponements. He said that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the commencement of the initiative. Keyamo made this known in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Sunday night. His tweet read: “President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the take off of the Special Public Works Programme (engaging 774,000 unemployed itinerant Nigerians) to begin nationwide on Tuesday, January 5, 2021. All NDE state structures are already in top gear for the take-off ceremonies.” Recall that the programme designed to employ 1,000 Nigerians from each of the 774 Local Government Areas in Nigeria was initially scheduled for launch on October 1, 2020. The programme ran into delays after the power play between Keyamo and the Director-General, National Directorate of Employment, Dr Nasiru Mohammed Ladan Argungu, who was sacked last December. Everyone of the 774,000 workers will get N20,000 monthly for three months duration of the job.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-861654" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/KEYAMO.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="441" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/KEYAMO.jpg 590w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/KEYAMO-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px">
