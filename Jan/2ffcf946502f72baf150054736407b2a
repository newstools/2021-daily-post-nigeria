No fewer than three people were reportedly killed when some youths engaged operatives of the Amotekun Corps. The incident happened at Tapa in Ibarapa geo-political zone in Oyo State on Wednesday, sources told DAILY POST. Recall that the Western Nigeria Security Network (WNSN) also known as Amotekun Corps started its operation last year in Oyo State. On Thursday, there was a clash between the operatives of Amotekun Corps and some indigenes of Tapa in Ibarapa North Area of the state on Wednesday. DAILY POST gathered that before the clash erupted during a street carnival, Amotekun Corps operatives had gone to disperse the youths. A source in the town while narrating how the incident occurred said, “Those boys were having a carnival and probably they are expected to close by 10pm which they didn’t. The Amotekun told them to stop which took the boys some time to stop the sound. “In the course of trying to stop the carnival, there was an argument between the boys and the Amotekun which made the boys throw stones at the Amotekun officers. “Along the line, the Amotekun started shooting directly at them and now, at least three people have been confirmed dead while many people were injured. “Bullets are being removed from some people who did not partake in the carnival at all.” Commandant of Amotekun Corps in the state, Col. Olayinka Olayanju when contacted said he was on his way to the area. Olayanju who confirmed that there was a clash in the town, however, did not give details of what happened. He said, “I am on my way to Tapa. I am on my way to Tapa. I can’t tell you anything now. Because it is until I investigate. I am on my way to Tapa.”
