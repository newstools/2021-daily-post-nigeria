The Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, on Tuesday, rubbished the remark by the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore that Fulani herdsmen own all the lands in Nigeria. AYCF National President, Yerima Shettima insisted that nobody owns any land in Nigeria. Speaking with DAILY POST, Shettima said the government owns all the lands in the country, contrary to the group’s remark. Bello Abdullahi Bodejo, the group leader, had made the remark while insisting that no power can remove Fulani herdsmen from any forests in any state. Bedejo was reacting to the seven-day ultimatum given to Fulani herdsmen in Ondo forests by Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. Following the ultimatum which expired yesterday, Southwest governors had banned all forms of open grazing in the region. Reacting, Shettima said: “That is a stupid talk, nobody own lands, the government owns them. “The quit notice issued was a bit disturbing in this era when there is much suspicion across the board, at a time we are faced with a lot of challenges. “At a time we are supposed to clamour for unity, some interest came and started talking of a quit notice against citizens of our country, it’s disturbing especially when it is coming from a sitting governor who is a learned person, it’s unfortunate. “However, I’m happy the issue is being resolved amicably during a meeting between the Southwest governors and Miyetti Allah yesterday. “I understand they had a meeting with Miyetti Allah yesterday, they arrived at a conclusion and I hope that will be sustained and they stand by the rules and hope such a thing never repeats itself again.”
