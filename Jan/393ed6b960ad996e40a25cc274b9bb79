Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has described midfielder, Scott McTominay, as a ‘monster’ of a human being following the Red Devils’ FA Cup third-round 1-0 win against Watford on Saturday. Solskjaer was impressed with McTominay’s performance against Watford, stating that the Scotland international was more dangerous against the visitors. McTominay’s header gave Man United the victory against Watford at Old Trafford. Speaking to BBC Match of the Day after the match, Solskjaer said, “Scott has had a very good season. “He is being more and more dangerous, we know he can be a box-to-box midfielder. “He should have scored a few more on set-plays before now because he is a monster of a human being. I am very happy he got the goal.” Man United’s next fixture is against Burnley in the Premier League on Tuesday.
