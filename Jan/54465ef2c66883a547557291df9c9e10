A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Osogbo, on Tuesday, ordered that a 32-year-old fake prophet, Olajide Omolere, who allegedly obtained N1.1 million from a woman to solve her ”spiritual problems”, be remanded in Ilesa Correctional Centre. Earlier, the Police Counsel, ASP Idoko John told the court that the defendant committed the offence between November and December 2020. John disclosed that the defendant conspired with others at large and defrauded a businessman, Fatai Sadiku, of N1.1 million. He alleged that the defendant collected the money to perform a ”spiritual cleansing” for Sadiku’s business to grow. The offence contravened the provisions of sections 422, 419, 516, and 390 (9) of the Criminal Code Cap 34 vol.11, laws of Osun, 2002. Omolere was charged with three counts of conspiracy, theft and fraud. Magistrate Mary Awodele in ruling ordered that the defendant be remanded, due to the magnitude of the offence. Awodele refused the defendant bail application and ordered him to file a formal bail application. She then adjourned the matter until Feb. 9, NAN reports.
