A Catholic Priest of the Diocese of Minna, Rev.Father John Gbakaan Yaji has allegedly been kidnapped and killed by bandits in Tufa village along Lambata-Lapai road in Niger State. The Rev father Yaji was abducted on Friday night in Tufa village on his way back to his station after attending a church program alongside his fellow priests and killed by the bandits. It was gathered that the late Priest was kidnapped along with his younger brother whose whereabouts is not yet known. Reacting to the development when contacted, the state Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Niger State, Rev. Matthias Echioda described the kidnap and killing of the late Priest as unfortunate and painful. According to him, “these attacks are unfortunate and we should not base them as religious but we should all come together to put an end to Banditry. And I know God who answers prayers will deliver us from the hands of the wicked”. However, efforts to get the reaction of the state Police Command failed as the Public Relations Officer, ASP. Wasiu Abiodun could not be reached as at the time of filing this report
