Amid the resurgence of COVID-19, the National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, has urged the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, not to stop the resumption of academic activities. President of NANS, Sunday Asefon, said a Taskforce would be setup on COVID-19 in universities across the country. Asefon, in a statement, said government should address the issue of the resurgence in COVID-19, rather than stop the resumption of schools. He urged the federal government to rethink its strategy on how to curb COVID-19. According to Asefon: “Rather than postpone schools’ resumption, it has become imperative to address the alarming spread of COVID-19 and rising cases of deaths from a position of environmental strategy and human coordination since the lockdown mechanism can no longer be a mitigating option in the face of our economic reality. “Consequently, the National Association of Nigerian Students is undertaking to prevail on students union bodies to set up Students Task Force Against COVID-19 in every school, while asking the Federal Government to rejig its basic COVID guidelines for schools resumption.” Recall that the federal government had hinted that schools may not resume on January 18 as scheduled. Adamu Adamu, the Minister of Education said schools may not resume on the set date due to the rising cases of COVID-19 across the country. He disclosed that government was currently reviewing the resumption date for schools.
