The Northern governors have agreed to openly take the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Simon Lalong, Chairman of Northern Governors disclosed that the move was aimed at dousing fear in the region. Lalong, who is the Governor of Plateau State, disclosed this yesterday at a teleconference organised by the Sir Ahmadu Bello Memorial Foundation, SABMF. Represented by Danladi Atu, Secretary to the Plateau State Government, the governor said he and his colleagues have agreed to be in front line to take the first doses. The Governor said the action would encourage the people to take the vaccine. “We, the northern governors, have agreed to take the first doses of the vaccines,” the governor said. Recall that the Nigerian Governors Forum, NGF, had said the COVID-19 vaccine would arrive the country by February ending.
