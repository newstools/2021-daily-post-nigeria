Nothing has happened in front of Lawson schools. It was a little bit farther and I want to tell you to please stay in your offices. Jehovah is in control. Your children are in safe hands. God is in control. Your children are safe. God bless you all,‚Äù she confirmed. About six vehicles, six motorbikes were said to have been burnt in the Tuesday morning inferno, throwing the Ogun capital into mourning. Watch video: Dear Esteem Parents, We hereby notify you that both the students and staff are safe and secure. No need of panicking or rushing to pick your child. It is well in Jesus Name.
