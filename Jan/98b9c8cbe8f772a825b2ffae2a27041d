The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Wednesday cautioned Nigerians against buying and selling their National Identity Numbers, NIN. EFCC warned that those engaging in such acts would be arrested and prosecuted for fraud. A statement by the EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwajaren also called on Nigerians to report anyone seeking to buy their NIN to the anti-graft agency or security operatives. “The EFCC wishes to alert Nigerians that it is not only illegal to sell their NIN, they stand the risk of vicarious liability for any act of criminality linked to their NIN. “In other words, they risk arrest and prosecution for any act of criminality linked to their NIN whether or not they are directly responsible for such crimes,” Uwajaren said. Recall that the National Identity Management Commission, NIMC, had cautioned those extorting NIN applicants. NIMC had warned that those culpable risks a seven-year jail term.
