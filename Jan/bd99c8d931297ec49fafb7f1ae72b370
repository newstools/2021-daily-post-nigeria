Popular Nigerian Comedian, Oluwadamilola Adekoya, also known as Princess says she almost died after her marriage crashed. Recall that Princess got married in 2013 at Balmoral Events Centre, Oregun, Lagos to a Yoruba movie actor/producer, Jeremiah Adeshola. However, their marriage lasted for just two weeks. Finally speaking about her marriage, Princess on TVC said she slid into depression and almost lost her life after the marriage crashed. She said: “I nearly died when my marriage ended in two weeks, I was down with depression. “It happened to Funke, Tiwa Savage and they came out strong. Funke tried to talk to me but I could not come out on top like them but remained down. “I nearly died if not for people who loved me.” Recall Tiwa Savage’s marriage to Teebillz crashed in 2016 after the latter accused the singer of infidelity.
