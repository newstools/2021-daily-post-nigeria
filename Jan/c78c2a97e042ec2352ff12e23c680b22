Chief Edwin Clark, South-South Leader of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), has urged the Sole Administrator of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) Mr. Effiong Akwa to operate within the laws establishing the commission. The elder statesman gave the charge on Wednesday while receiving the management of the commission at his residence in Abuja. Clerk disclosed that the commission had been under pressure lately from the people of Niger Delta for operating outside the law. According to him, the appointment of Akwa was based on his qualification and urged him to live up to expectations during his tenure. “There is a law governing NDDC, and no one should breach that law. Not even the president has the power to do so unless it is amended by the National Assembly. “Any attempt to breach the law becomes illegal, null and void. “There have been many arguments on the legality of a sole administration over the years. They are appointed over time to oversee the commission. “I wish you the best of luck. We support your appointment,” Clerk said.
