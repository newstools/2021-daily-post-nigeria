Kanu fought on the Biafran side during the civil war and was reabsorbed into the Nigerian military at the end of the war in 1970. Reacting, Atiku, in a tweet on Twitter, described Kanu as an outstanding soldier and activist who contributed tremendously in ousting the military and ushering in the democracy that the country enjoys today. “Rear Admiral Ndubuisi Kanu was an outstanding soldier and administrator of Imo and Lagos. But his most defining work was as an activist who contributed tremendously in ousting the military and ushering in the democracy that we enjoy today. He will be sorely missed,” Atiku tweeted. “On behalf of my family, I convey my deepest condolences to his family and the government and people of Imo and Lagos that he served with distinction. May his soul rest in peace.”
