Chelsea striker, Olivier Giroud, has no intention to leave Stamford Bridge for Juventus in this January transfer window. Giroud wants to remain at Chelsea amid interest from Juventus. This was made known by respected sports journalist and transfer expert, Nicolo Schira. Schira disclosed this in a tweet via his official Twitter handle on Tuesday. His tweet reads: “Olivier #Giroud wants to stay at #Chelsea. #Juventus and #Inter have asked info to his agent (Michael Manuello), but the French striker has chosen to stay with #Blues until the end of the season.” Meanwhile, Juventus manager, Andrea Pirlo, has confirmed that the Serie A champions are interested in signing Giroud.
