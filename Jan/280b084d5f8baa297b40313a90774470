Malami Yandoto, Chairman, Zamfara State Local Government Service Commission, is dead. He died in Sokoto after attending a wedding ceremony. Governor Aminu Tambuwal has commiserated with the Zamfara State Government and Tsafe Emirate. Tambuwal said the death was a lesson for everyone. He recalled their days at the Nigerian Law School in Lagos. The governor also spoke of his last meeting with Yandoto. “We had just attended a wedding ceremony together in Sokoto and came to the government house, where we exchanged banters and reminisced on the past as we used to do. “As we retreated to perform ‘ablution’ we came out to find that he was no more. None of us thought that his hour was near,” Tambuwal said. He described the deceased as a good, jovial and courteous man. Tambuwal prayed that Allah accept him, grant him Aljanna Firdaus and give his family the fortitude to bear the loss.
