The Nigeria Police, on Tuesday, deployed 1,250 Special Constabulary Police, to boost community policing in Lagos State. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu urged the officers to operate within the guidelines. Represented by his Chief of Staff, Tayo Ayinde, Sanwo-Olu said the constabulary police were recruited to improve on the existing security architecture. He explained that their major responsibility was to get credible and timely intelligence on activities within communities. The governor assured that the officers’ welfare would get priority attention. Sanwo-Olu appealed to all residents, community leaders and associations to cooperate with the security personnel. The Commandant of Police College, Ikeja, AIG Olasupo Ajani, urged the graduating officers to perform their job diligently and professionally. “You are warned not to wear any other police uniform except the black uniform issued to you. Do not wear blue or the camouflage uniform of conventional police officers,’’ he warned.
