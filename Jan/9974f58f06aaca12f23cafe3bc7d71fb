Former UFC champion, Conor McGregor, has said he lost to American professional mixed martial boxer because his leg was dead during the fight. He also revealed that he would come back and fight again after losing to Poirier. McGregor was left staggering after suffering the first knockout defeat of his UFC career to Poirier earlier on Sunday. The Irishman was stopped in the second round at UFC 257, admitting that Poirier’s leg kicks were good. “His leg kicks were good, my leg was dead, and I was not as comfortable as I needed to be,” McGregor said as quoted by BBC Sport after the fight. “I have to dust it off and come back, and that’s what I will do. “I am gutted, it is a tough one to swallow, I just want to go back to the hotel and chill with my kids and regroup.” McGregor’s loss reduces the chances of a potential rematch between him and Khabib Nurmagomedov.
