The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has condemned President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, for saying only God can resolve the insecurity challenges in the country. PDP’s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan said Adesina’s comment has exposed Buhari’s government as completely helpless and incompetent. Adesina had said Nigerians should handover the insecurity issues in the country to God. Reacting, PDP said Adesina’s remark was an admission of Buhari’s failure. A statement by Ologbondiyan said: Buhari administration is “completely helpless and has come to its wits end in governance; a development, which validates the position of majority of Nigerians that President Buhari is grossly incompetent and should step aside. “It further goes to confirm that the Buhari’s administration has outlived its usefulness, if it had any, and that the promises and assurances made by President Buhari, on the fight against insecurity amount to mere lip service. “While we believe in the powers and interventions of God, our party restates that such comes with the commitment, determination and show of responsibility on the part of those in leadership positions; an obligation in which the Buhari Presidency has completely failed.” Boko Haram: You have failed - PDP attacks Buhari over beheading of 43 farmers in Borno Killings: Visit Katsina, Kaduna, Borno - PDP challenges Buhari PDP reacts to Adesina's re-election as AfDB President
