Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, has lampooned some Yoruba leaders for being silent on herdsmen killings in the region. He said the individuals were sitting on the fence because they want to be president in 2023. On Sunday, the former presidential aide stated that the constitution does not grant the Fulani or anyone else the right to commit murder or turn the South-West into killing fields. He added that the constitution also does not regard Yoruba blood as being cheaper than others and neither does it prescribe that the people are to be treated like sacrificial lamb and killed at will. “Some Yoruba leaders want to be President or Vice President in 2023 and are therefore prepared to keep quiet and tolerate this rubbish that is being done to our people. I am not one of those leaders.” The government critic expressed regret that influential Yorubas had betrayed their people for Northerners’ support and acceptance. He commended Sunday Igboho, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, Professor Banji Akintoye, Nnamdi Kanu, Afenifere, SOKAPU, Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) and all others that have spoken out against killer herdsmen. Fani-Kayode noted that those who have supported or attempted to rationalise the criminal behaviour of the killers in the name of political correctness or political expediency are treacherous and shameless. “If you are a Yoruba man and you want to be President or Vice President, I wonder whose affairs will you be presiding over and who will you lead or represent at the national level if all your people have been killed? Soon we shall start calling the collaborators and coward’s out by name”, he added.
