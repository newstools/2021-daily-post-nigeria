The Akwa Ibom State Police Command, on Tuesday, began an investigation into the alleged molestation, starvation and sexual abuse of one Don Davies, a JSS1 student of Deeper Life High School, Idoro Road Uyo, by some students and management of the School. The command assured a discreet investigation that would unravel the truth. Recall that the mother of the boy, Deborah Archibong had raised the alarm of his 11-year-old son’s abuse, which is now trending on social media. The video on social media caught the attention of the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, who ordered the former Commissioner of Education Mrs Enobong Mbobo to investigate the complaints and report to the government for necessary action. Last week, International Human Right Groups waded into the matter while Akwa Ibom State Government withdrew for police to investigate the incident . However, the Police Public Relations Officer in the State, SP Odiko Macdon in a statement on Tuesday, said the command received a petition from the victim’s mother and commenced investigations immediately. According to the statement, “The Akwa Ibom State Police Command is in receipt of a petition by one Mrs Deborah Archibong ( 41), mother of one Don-Davis Iniobong Archibong, aged 11yrs, a student of Deeper Life High School, Idoro Road, Uyo, wherein she alleged that her son, Master Don-Davis Iniobong was inhumanly treated, sexually molested and suffered starvation, against one Mrs Ndidi Solomon (45) and three others. “The Commissioner of Police, CP Amiengheme Andrew ordered a discreet investigation into the matter and the said investigation has commenced immediately.” He added that the CP enjoined all parties involved to exercise restraint pending the outcome of the investigation, stressing that the outcome would be made public. Meanwhile, it was gathered that all parties involved in the matter are currently in a meeting with the CP at the State Police headquarters, Ikot Akpan Abia, at the time of filing the report.
