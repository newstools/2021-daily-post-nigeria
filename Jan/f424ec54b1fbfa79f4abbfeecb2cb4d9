The Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, has again gone into isolation due to contact with victims of COVID-19. This is the second time Ortom would go into isolation since coronavirus was reported in Nigeria last year’s February. Ortom had in July 2020 went into isolation when his wife, Mrs Eunice Ortom, son, and some of the wife’s personal aides tested positive for the deadly virus. Engr Benson Abounu, the State Deputy Governor, disclosed this on Sunday at the Armed Forces Interdenominational service held at the ECWA Church, Makurdi. According to Abounu, his principal decided to go into isolation following the medical report indicating that a certain Permanent Secretary (whose name he refused to reveal) and his family members tested positive for COVID-19. “As I speak with you, the Governor has been in isolation for about nine days and has shown no symptoms or signs of the virus. So, am happy to inform you that by tomorrow, we should be able to certify him free and he will resume work,” Abounu said.
