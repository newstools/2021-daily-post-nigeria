Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has warned Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men about two Liverpool players, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson ahead of both sides’ clash in the Premier League on Sunday evening at Anfield. Scholes believes both Alexander-Arnold and Robertson are the two ‘biggest threats’ in Liverpool squad that can hurt Man United. The ex-midfield maestro urged Man United to find a way to stop the duo. Man United head to the game after beating Burnley 1-0 in their last Premier League tie, while Liverpool was defeated 1-0 by Southampton. “[Man] United will never have a better chance to win at Anfield,” Scholes told ESPN. “It is a massive advantage in their favour that there will be no fans inside the ground and, in my opinion, more important than Liverpool’s injury problems in defence. “Whenever I played at Anfield, the crowd was the biggest influence on the game. It was always so tough to go there because of that, but it is not a factor on Sunday. “It is still a huge challenge facing United, though. Liverpool have great forwards who can score from nothing, but the biggest threat comes from the full-backs, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, and United have to find a way to stop them.”
