New Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said they have to be “realistic” about winning the Premier League title this season. Tuchel took charge of his first game on Wednesday night – a 0-0 draw with Wolves at Stamford Bridge. The German is under no illusions he will be expected to fight for the title, but he believes the Blues have “the capacity to hurt everybody in every league”. However, he suggested that a top-four finish would be an acceptable result this season, although he pointed out there are “a lot of teams and points” between Chelsea and the Champions League spots. Tuchel said: ‘The title, ooh, far away. We have to be realistic at the same time. “When you sign for Chelsea as manager, it is absolutely right you sign for the expectation to fight for titles; Premier League, Champions League and cups. “It’s absolutely clear, but at the same time we have to be realistic that there are a lot of teams and points between us and fourth. “So maybe it’s the best time now to step up in the middle of the season. Don’t lose the focus in looking too far. “I’m absolutely sure we have the capacity to hurt everybody in every league and competition and it’s my job to bring evidence of that as fast as possible.”
