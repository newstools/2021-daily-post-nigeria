Popular Nigerian Singer, Naira Marley has reacted to viral video of some school children being arrested by Amotekun operatives. According to reports, the students were arrested for modelling themselves as ‘Marlians’. In the video which has gone viral on social media, a lady who is supposedly a teacher in the school, described the boys as criminals. The teacher tagged the leader of the group as ‘Naira Marley’ and a bad influence to the other children. She stated that they were caught in a bush but, however, failed to state their wrong acts. The video caught the attention of Naira Marley who strongly condemned the arrest of the students, describing it as ‘Child Abuse’. He wrote; “Guys look what’s happening in stupid Nigeria.How can you arrest school kids? This is child abuse. The teachers and this stupid uncles with guns need to get arrested.” The ‘Marlian’ leader demanded for the address of the school as he expressed his desire to meet the students. “I want to meet all these kids, I owe them, please help me with the name of the school or link me up with any of my Marlian Kids. I want to see the witch behind the camera self. What is amotekun self? If they treat your child like this, what would you do? Did you see the slap? You calling someone child criminal?
