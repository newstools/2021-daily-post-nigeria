Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has reacted to the presidency’s response to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu’s move to evict Fulani herdsmen from forests in Ondo State. Following the high rate of criminalities which come in form of kidnappings, raping of women and killings allegedly being committed by criminals hiding in forests across Ondo State, Governor Akeredolu had given herdsmen a seven-day ultimatum to vacate the areas. But in a swift reaction, the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria cried out over the governor’s directive leading to Presidency’s statement through the Senior Special Assistant to the President, Garba Shehu, cautioning Akeredolu against the move, saying the herders cannot leave the forests for any reason. And Kanu feels that it is now clear to all and sundry, especially the Yoruba, that Fulani grand stratagem is to use the herdsmen from all across the Sahel to conquer lands in the entire South. “Is it not clear now to all and sundry, especially my Yoruba brethren, that Fulani grand stratagem is to use Fulani herdsmen terrorists from all across the Sahel to conquer our ancestral lands in the entire South, thereby turning the whole of #Nigeria into an almighty Fulani caliphate as #IPOB has been warning for years? “In their ignorance, some ignorant Yoruba Fulanised commentators and journalists called us all manner of unprintable names just because we saw what they were unable to see many years back. “Little did [some] few misguided individuals, know that Fulani terrorists in Aso Rock saw IPOB as the only credible obstacle on their path to the total conquest of the entire South. “Today my Yoruba friends are feeling the full impact of true janjaweed intentions of this Fulani presidency on their lives,” he wrote.
