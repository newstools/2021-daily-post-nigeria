Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said the club wants midfielder, Jesse Lingard, to return from his loan move to Premier League side West Ham “revitalized”. Solskjaer said this on Friday at his pre-match press conference ahead of Man United’s Premier League tie with Arsenal on Saturday. Lingard is set to join West Ham on loan for the rest of the season. The 28-year-old made only three appearances for Man United this season. “It’s likely that Jesse’s loan deal with West Ham is going through,” Solskjaer said. “We want Jesse to come back here revitalized and having shown at West Ham how good a player he is. “He’s just been unfortunate with a couple of issues. Some periods he had to stay away from us with COVID-19 isolation and close contact.”
