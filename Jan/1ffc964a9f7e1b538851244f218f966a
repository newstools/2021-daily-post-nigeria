The former secretary to the government of the federation Senator Anyim Pius Anyim on Thursday denied being the mastermind of the 2023 presidential campaign poster bearing his picture and currently in wide circulation in the social media. Anyim, who was a former President of the Senate, disassociated himself from the campaign poster, stressing that such campaign poster is capable of distracting President Mohammadu Buhari who had just spent only one year and seven months in his second tenure. Anyim made the assertions in a press statement signed and forwarded to newsmen in Abakaliki, the capital of Ebonyi State. He said the posters which have been circulating on social media should be disregarded. According to him: ” My attention has just been drawn to posters and stories circulating on social media One of them has the inscription ” progress 2023 Anyim Pius Anyim for President… with my picture on it. I want to state very emphatically that I do not have a hand in those posters and campaigns and did not authorize any such publications”. “As a law-abiding citizen, I am fully aware that it is not the time for the campaign for 2023 elections”. “The Government at the Federal level has spent only a year and seven months out of a four-year term, grappling with the issues of governance and so should not be distracted”. “I join the general public to disregard any such posters and or Publications as they are not from me” he stated.
