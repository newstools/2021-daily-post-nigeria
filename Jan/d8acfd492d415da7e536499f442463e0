On Sunday, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara, Dr Rex Olawoye has said that any attempt to resolve the party’s crisis in the State without resorting to the constitution and the resolution of the National Executive Committee would fail. Olawoye disclosed this in Ilorin while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on how to resolve the APC crisis in Kwara. Recall that the national body of APC had referred the matter to the North Central Zone executives for settlement. “I don’t know the method the North Central Zone executive of the party wants to use to resolve the issue,” Olawoye said. “One thing that is sure is that whatever method that does not follow the constitution and the resolution of NEC is null and void. “So if Governor Sani Bello of Niger wants peace, he should go by the truth, you go for absolute truth, nothing but the truth and he should be blunt about it,” he said. Olawoye added: “We are talking about NEC, you are talking about North Central. How many of us are members of North Central? “What is happening is that they know that it’ll not work.” Olawoye also urged the NEC of APC to appeal to Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq “to let sleeping dogs lie.” “It’s the National Executive Council of the party that can resolve this crisis. I haven’t seen where people in that hierarchy of the party would say one word and swallow it the second day. “They would resolve and get a resolution, and somebody that is supposed to execute that resolution would turn it upside down, and they are looking at him. “That person ought to be fired from the party because that is the highest order of disobedience. “Discipline is one of the things that is killing this party,” Olawoye said.
