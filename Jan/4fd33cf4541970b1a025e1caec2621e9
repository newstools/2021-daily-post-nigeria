Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said he expects Harry Kane to be out for “a few weeks.”. Kane injured both ankles during their 3-1 home defeat to Liverpool on Thursday night. The England striker was subbed off at half-time, after twice going down in the first 45 minutes. “Two ankles, the first was a bad tackle from Thiago [Alcantara]. The second one I don’t know well. “But two injuries in both ankles and the second one worst than the first one,” Mourinho said after the match. When asked how long Kane will be out for, Mourinho replied: “A few weeks. I don’t know. There are some players you can’t replace.” With a busy period coming up, starting with Sunday’s trip to Brighton and Hove Albion and then a home clash with Chelsea next week, Kane’s absence would be keenly felt.
