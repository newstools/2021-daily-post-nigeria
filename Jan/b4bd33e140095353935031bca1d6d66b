The former Chairman, defunct Pension Reformed Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina, on Wednesday, prayed Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court, Abuja, for another bail. Maina, in a motion by his lawyer, Anayo Adibe on notice dated and filed on Dec. 24, 2020, with charge number: FHC/ABJ/CR/258/19 Maina said the bail application became necessary over his worsening health condition, NAN reports. He, however, did not give details of the purported health issue. Justice Abang, who noted that it was not convenient for the court to hear the matter, adjourned the hearing of the application until Feb. 1. DAILY POST recalls that Main in 2020 was granted N500m bail but stopped attending proceedings, setting Ali Ndume, senator representing Borno South, who stood as his surety against the law. Justice Abang, after a number of sittings without his presence, revoked Maina’s bail, issued a warrant for his arrest and remanded his surety in prison. However, the ex-Pensions boss’ escape to Niger Republic was exposed after he was arrested by the International Police (Interpol) and extradited to Nigeria on December 3.
