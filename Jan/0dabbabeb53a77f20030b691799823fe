Some angry youths have set ablaze the house of the Seriki Fulani of Oyo State, Alhaji Saliu Abdulkadir. DAILY POST gathered that the house was set ablaze in Igangan town in Ibarapa North Local government area of the State on Friday. Our correspondent learnt that about eleven cars were also set ablaze during the incident. It was gathered that the house was set ablaze few hours after the visit of Mr. Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho to the town. Mr. Adeyemo had earlier issued a seven (7) day ultimatum to herdsmen who have been accused of kidnapping, killing and attack on innocent Nigerians in Ibarapa geopolitical zone of the state. Public Relations Officer of Jamunatirube, Alhaji Mustafa Aliu confirmed the incident to journalists. Abdulkadir also confirmed the attack on his house. He said, “As we speak, we are in the bush. Our cars numbering about eleven have been burnt. Some of my children sustained injuries and we are finding a way to take them to the hospital. My children have left their houses for the bush. “We need government to help us. Police, operation burst and other security agencies were there when they set my house ablaze.” But a close aide to Mr. Adeyemo who spoke on condition of anonymity said the incident must have been after his master had left Igangan town. He said, “Sunday Igboho was there not to fight but to appeal to both sides and assure Yoruba residents that there won’t be problem.”
