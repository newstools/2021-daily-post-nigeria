Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has tested positive for COVID-19. Real Madrid made the announcement in a statement via its website on Friday afternoon. This is coming less than 48 hours after his side were knocked out from the Copa del Rey by Alcoyano on Wednesday night. The statement read: “Real Madrid C. F. report that our coach Zinedine Zidane has tested positive for COVID-19.” Zidane will now be in isolation in the next couple of days. The Frenchman will miss Real Madrid’s away La Liga tie against Alaves on Saturday night. His assistant, David Bettoni, will be in charge of Real Madrid’s next game.
