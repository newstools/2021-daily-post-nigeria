The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has said National Identification Number (NIN) holders will have to pay N15,000 to correct their dates of birth in the commission’s database. NIMC Regional Coordinator, Mrs Funmi Opesanwo, stated this on Wednesday at the commission’s office in Alausa, Lagos State. According to her, NIN holders would be required to pay a N5,000 processing fee for card renewal or card replacement, as well as an address modification fee of N500. Opesanwo reiterated that NIN enrolment is free, but card renewal, correction of date of birth, and change of address attract fees. She said, “For the date of birth correction, there is a processing fee of N15,000. “For card renewal or card replacement, there is a processing fee of N5,000. For the modification of address or name, it is N500. So, people misconstrue this to mean that in NIMC they are asking them to pay money. No, those are for services.” Opesanwo noted that the fees are payable to the Treasury Single Account of the Federal Government. “For correction of date of birth, it is N15,000 and it is payable to the TSA,” she added. —
