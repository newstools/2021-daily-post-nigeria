Paris Saint-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has tested positive for COVID-19. PSG disclosed this in a tweet via their official Twitter handle on Friday. The 48-year-old Argentine will “respect isolation and is subject to the appropriate health protocols”, PSG tweeted. His assistants Jesus Perez and Miguel D’Agostino will take charge of the team for their Ligue 1 clash against Angers on Saturday. Pochettino took over from Thomas Tuchel last December and signed a contract with PSG to remain at the French champions until June 30, 2022 with an option for an additional year. The Argentine won his first trophy at the club when PSG defeated Marseille 2-1 on Wednesday. Three PSG players, Rafinha, Thilo Kehrer and Colin Dagba had already tested positive for Coronavirus last week.
