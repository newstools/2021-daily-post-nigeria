Bello Matawalle, the Governor of Zamfara State, has ordered the immediate suspension of a number of district and village heads in Maradun emirate. Some Fulanis were killed on Thursday in the domains of the affected leaders. Matawalle issued the order during a security meeting with traditional rulers, security agents, religious leaders and journalists at the Government House. “It is sad to note that during this meeting, we have received two different security breach reports from two different areas. The emir of Maradun is hereby directed to leave this meeting.” The governor directed him to “suspend the traditional rulers in which these acts took place and initiate ways to identify and bring the perpetrators of the act of the authorities within the next three days or face the consequence himself.” Matawalle warned that any traditional ruler in whose area the outlawed ‘Yan sa kai (volunteer security members) take the law into their hands would be removed and probed.
