He disclosed that the team were on motorcycles when they were ambushed adding that the Agro Rangers official was responding to treatment. The security adviser further said that the state was over time witnessing the hit and run attack from the bandits. He disclosed that most of their recent attacks were “targeted at Livestock Guards probably to intimidate them from doing their work” but said such would not deter them.
