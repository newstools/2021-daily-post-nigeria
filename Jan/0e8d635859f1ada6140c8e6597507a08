The Senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has urged politicians to bury their 2023 presidential ambitions until Nigeria returns to a normal state. Giwa advised politicians jostling for the 2023 presidency to urgently assemble together and solve the salient issues in the country. He spoke while addressing his members in Akure and was contained in a statement sent to DAILY POST on Sunday. The pastor predicted that Nigeria might collapse before 2023 if politicians ignored warnings in tackling some challenges currently facing the country. He said: “Don’t forget I told you that the political entities would split into smaller parts ahead of 2023 and this development might pave the way for total disintegration in Nigeria. “Let me advise all those jostling for the presidency in 2023 to bury their ambitions and focus on fixing some important issues in Nigeria. “How can a president treat a certain region specifically and neglecting others? Imagine security men protecting criminal herdsmen in Nigeria. “They have divided the country themselves; what we are waiting for is the official pronouncement from president Buhari. “Injustice, wickedness, nepotism, selfishness and tribalism pervading Nigeria over the years. All these issues must be addressed if Nigeria wants to remain as a nation.”
