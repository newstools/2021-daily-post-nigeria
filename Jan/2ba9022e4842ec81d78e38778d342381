A Lagos lawmaker, Jude Idimogu, has renewed his call for state police citing insecurity in Nigeria. The House of Assembly member decried the rate of banditry and Boko Haram. Idimogu (APC – Oshodi/Isolo Constituency II) told the federal government to allow states to handle its security. He noted that the government could deploy its own police formation when the state government could no longer handle the situation. “The Federal Government is doing its best in terms of improving security; maybe their best is not enough. The Assembly and the state government have been clamouring about the state police”, NAN quoted him as saying. “We cannot do it alone since security is on the exclusive list. The federal government has to agree with the state governments in the country so the National Assembly can amend the constitution in that regard.” Idimogu added that state police would know where the criminals are and arrest them easily.
