Mesut Ozil and Fenerbahce have reached an agreement over his proposed transfer from Arsenal this month, the UK Mirror reports. The 32-year-old will wear the number 23 shirt, dropping the 10 he wore for the Gunners. The Turkish club are also planning a special presentation ceremony for Ozil, who could sign his new contract as early as Saturday. The midfielder leaves the Emirates, having been frozen out by manager Mikel Arteta. Ozil has been linked with both DC United and Fenerbahce in recent weeks, but he is eager to return to Turkey. His legal representatives will now hold negotiations with Arsenal in a bid to terminate his deal and make him a free agent.
