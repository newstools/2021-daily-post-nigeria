Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan has condemned Governor Babagana Zulum’s claims that Christians are members of Boko Haram. DAILY POST had reported that Governor Zulum said this while speaking during the 17th Chief Gani Fawehinmi Annual Lecture organised by the Nigerian Bar Association in Ikeja, Lagos State Zulum had said Boko Haram has members who are Christians, Muslims, white men and Asians. But Omokri says Nigerians would have been on fire if a Christian had made such claims. The former Presidential spokesperson making reference to Bishop Kukah’s Christmas message asked Zulum to name the Christians among former Boko Haram members who have been rehabilitated by the Buhari-led administration. On his Twitter page, Omokri wrote “If a Christian uttered the rubbish Zulum uttered, Nigeria would be on fire. “Take Bishop Kukah’s Christmas message, no mention of Islam yet, JNI, MURIC and Sharia Council wanted to crucify him. “Cam Zulum tell us how many of them are Christians? the useless man just woke up and vomited what will make this country divide! Omokri taking a swipe at the Governor suggested that Nigeria should break up if we cannot co-exist. “If we cannot stay together peacefully, perhaps we should go our separate ways! “Zulumand his useless Buhari government have been rehabilitating thousands of ‘repentant’ Boko Haram for years.”
