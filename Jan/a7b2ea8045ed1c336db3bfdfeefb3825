Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, on Wednesday, warned Chelsea not to expect assured success from their new manager, Thomas Tuchel, because of his record at Paris Saint-Germain. Chelsea had on Tuesday appointed Tuchel as the Blues manager following the sacking of Frank Lampard on Monday. Tuchel won two Ligue 1 titles with PSG during his time in France. Comparing Tuchel’s job at PSG to working in the Premier League, Mourinho said at his pre-match press conference ahead of Tottenham’s Premier League tie with Liverpool on Thursday, “You can’t compare the job at Paris Saint Germain with the job in the Premier League. “It is not possible to compare.” Tuchel’s first game for Chelsea will be against Wolves in the Premier League on Wednesday night. Chelsea is presently in the 10th position on the Premier League table with 29 points from 19 games.
