Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has insisted that his team’s exit from the Spanish Supercopa at the hands of Athletic Bilbao is not “a failure.” The holders crashed out on Thursday night after losing 2-1 to Athletic Bilbao in the second semi-final. Raul Garcia scored a first-half to give the Basque club the lead, before Karim Benzema pulled one back after the break. Marco Asensio came close to scoring, but was denied twice by the woodwork. Athletic will now face Barcelona in the final on Sunday in Seville. “It’s not a failure. A failure is not to give your all on the pitch and not to try. “The team tried but we couldn’t get the equaliser. Life is like this. You can’t always win,” Zidane told reporters after the game.
