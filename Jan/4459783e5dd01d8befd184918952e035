A team of armed security operatives has been deployed to the Zamfara State office of the National Identification Management Commission in Gusau, to protect the lives and properties of the workers. Our correspondent who visited the office reports that it was sealed while no official of the commission could be sighted, except security men who were patrolling the premises. However, one Haruna Abdulahi who said he is a messenger in the office told our reporter that the workers were on strike due to the inability of the management of the commission to implement the approved minimum wage. Abdulahi claimed that since the federal government and the labour unions agreed on a new minimum wage two years ago, the management of the commission has not mentioned anything about it. He also alleged that workers promotions have been stalled without any implementation, forcing the workers to agitate. “Everyone knows quite well the pressure mounted on us by Nigerians due to the rush to obtain their national identification cards, yet our management feels unconcerned” he lamented. DAILY POST gathered that the national identification cards seekers were distancing themselves from the area due to the presence of the armed security men in the area. When asked what brought about the presence of the armed security men in the area, Abdulahi said that the officials of the commission were afraid that the angry crowd of customers could use the opportunity to destroy and loot properties in the commission.
