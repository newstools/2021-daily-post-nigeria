President Muhammadu Buhari has said he holds no grudges against Nigerians who feel his administration hasn’t made enough progress in the past five years, especially as it relates to insecurity. The President made this known during his 2021 New Year message to Nigerians on Friday. According to him, his administration was making efforts to see that those issues were properly tackled. “I am aware that for some of our compatriots, feel that the progress we have registered since the inception of this administration is not nearly as fast or as sufficient as they would wish. “I do not begrudge them or their views so far as they signify a wish, in which we all share, for only the very best for our country. “Nevertheless, I call upon all Nigerians to carefully recall the circumstances of our coming to office, the facts on the ground, and the resources at our disposal since 2015 with the accomplishments of this administration. “I also understand that the spate of violence in the country is been triggered by chronic poverty, social exclusion, and disillusionment among sections of the youth. “We are making efforts to see that these issues are properly tackled,” he said. Recall that Buhari was recently accused by the Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese, Most Reverend Fathy Mathew Hassan Kukah of crass nepotism which has never been experienced in the history of Nigeria. Bishop Kukah, in his Christmas message titled, “A Nation in Search of Vindication” delivered in Sokoto on Friday, noted that President Buhari had succeeded in sacrificing the dreams of Nigerians on the altar of nepotism by pursuing Northern hegemony.
