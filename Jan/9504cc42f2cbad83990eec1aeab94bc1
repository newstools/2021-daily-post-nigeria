Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has slammed those who dragged him to court over his support for the Judiciary. Governor Wike, who restated his commitment for the development of the judiciary while performing the formal opening of a legal firm; L. A. Mitee and Company in Port Harcourt, said he will not be distracted. He said an ill-informed lawyer does not have a grasp of how budgets function and what the role of government is in creating a conducive environment for the administration of justice. According to Wike, “Just this morning, the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice came to me that one lawyer in Port Harcourt went to court against the state government. He said we have no business in building houses for judges, we have no business providing cars for judges. “He said we have no business in building courts for federal institutions and that I have no right to even contribute to the structures in Nigeria Law School. “What will be our contribution to the administration of justice, when the structures are dilapidated. That lawyer is saying that what we are doing is not budgeted for. Everybody parades as if they know the law even when they don’t know the law. “People who are ignorant about the budget will just wake up in the morning and tell you the governor has no right to donate money somewhere. They make all kinds of allegations without having the facts.” President of Port Harcourt branch of Nigeria Bar Association, NBA, Prince Nyekwere, urged Governor Wike not to be weary in his support to the judiciary, which has enhanced the process of administration of justice both in the country.
