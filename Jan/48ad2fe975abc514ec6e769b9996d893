Governor Dapo Abiodun, on Tuesday received Hon. Yusuf Amosun, the lawmaker representing Ewekoro State Constituency and his other colleagues after their defection from the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). DAILY POST reports that Yusuf Amosun is a nephew to the immediate past Governor of Ogun State, Sen. Ibikunle Amosun. After announcing their defection to the APC during plenary, the APM lawmakers were led to the governor by the Speaker, Olakunle Oluomo.  In his words, Dapo Abiodun advised the legislators to be loyal to the APC, which now has 22 of the entire 26 lawmakers that make up the house. Abiodun, who described the lawmakers’ move as ‘home coming’, said they once left as a result of disagreement, but now returned home. While welcoming the lawmakers back to APC, Abiodun stated, “You have not come back through coercion or by force. Remember you will be criticised for coming back.” The governor reminded the defecting lawmakers that he did not discriminate against them in the past 18 months even while they were not with him. “We will ensure you enjoy all the benefits that our members enjoy,” he promised.  Speaking, Oluomo, noted that the return of the lawmakers was a symbol of Abiodun’s achievements in getting everyone on board, informing him that “our great party is totally and fully in charge of the State House of Assembly all due to your ability to manage the people of the State.” In their separate remarks, the seven lawmakers – Ganiyu Oyedeji (Ifo 2), Musefiu Lamidi (Ado-Odo/Ota 2), Latifat Ajayi (Yewa South), Adeniran Adeyinka (Sagamu 2) and Yusuf Amosun (Ewekoro) appreciated Abiodun for what they termed his inclusive policy, promising to contribute their quota to the socio-economic development of the State.
