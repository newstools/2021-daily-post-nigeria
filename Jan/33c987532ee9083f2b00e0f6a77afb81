Former Super Eagles striker, Yakubu Aiyegbeni, has vowed that he won’t apologise to Nigerians over the open goal he missed during the 2010 FIFA World Cup Group B match between Nigeria and South Korea in South Africa. Aiyegbeni missed a superb chance to put Nigeria ahead at the must-win group tie at Durban Stadium on June 22, 2010. Many Nigerians have been angry with the former Everton and Portsmouth star over the miss. But Aiyebeni is now saying that he cannot apologise to Nigerians because it wasn’t a deliberate miss. Speaking on the development after over a decade, Aiyebeni told NationTV on Wednesday: “I won’t apologise at all. Why should I? I have scored so many goals for Nigeria too. I have sacrificed a lot for the country. Did anyone apologise to me? “I cannot apologise because it was not a deliberate miss. I seriously wanted to score. “But it wasn’t to be. So many strikers have missed chances too, and nobody will apologise so I won’t.” Ayegbeni played for quite a lot of clubs in Europe, including Maccabi Haifa, Portsmouth, Middlesbrough and Everton. The 38-year-old retired from football in 2017.
