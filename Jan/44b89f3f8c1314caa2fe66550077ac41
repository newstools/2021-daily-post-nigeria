Ekiti State Government has cancelled the customary interdenominational service scheduled for Monday. The religious programme is usually held on the first working day of the year. Commissioner for Information, Akin Omole explained that the cancellation was part of efforts to curtail the spread of coronavirus in Ekiti. He affirmed Governor Kayode Fayemiâ€™s directive that public workers on grade level 12 and below should work from home. Omole appealed to the people to comply with all laid down protocols to protect themselves from contracting the virus. The commissioner added that the social distancing and face mask-wearing remained mandatory across the state. Omole emphasized the importance of avoiding crowds, keeping rooms well-ventilated, using alcohol-based hand sanitizers and regular hand washing.
