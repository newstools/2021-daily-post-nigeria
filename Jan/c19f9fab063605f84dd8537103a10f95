A video has surfaced on social media, showing a gory image of a driver who appeared to have been shot dead inside his bus by some unknown persons. DAILY POST reports that a background voice in the video claimed that the man was shot dead by suspected Fulani herdsmen along the Ibadan-Ijebu-Ode road. The video which went viral on Saturday, has been causing panic among residents of Ogun, especially commuters plying the highways. But the police in the state has denied the video, describing it as the handiwork of mischief-makers. Speaking with our correspondent on Saturday, the Ogun State police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi stated that “no incident like that happened in any part of the state.” Oyeyemi said, “the video was a deliberate and wicked attempt by some evil-minded persons to cause panic in the minds of the people, by deliberately promoting inter-ethnic hatred and discord online, for reasons best known to them. “On sighting the video, the state Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, directed the three Area Commanders and all the DPOs in Sagamu, Ijebu Ode and Ogbere to immediately carry out a joint fact-finding patrol of the Ijebu-Ode-Benin expressway up to Ogun State boundary with Ondo state,” Oyeyemi said. He, however stated that nothing of such was noticed anywhere along the road, just as no such incident was reported either directly by the victims or received through credible information in any of the police stations and formations in the state. He urged members of the public to disregard the video and go about their lawful businesses without any fear of molestation or harassment. He assured that those behind the “mischievous video will definitely be fished out.”
