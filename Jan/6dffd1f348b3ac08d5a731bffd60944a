Members of the Correspondents Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Bauchi State Council, on Monday resolved to henceforth boycott all activities of the state’s Deputy Governor, Baba Tela. The decision, according to a press release signed by the secretary of the chapel, Mr Samuel Luka, was taken at an emergency congress, adding that it was as a result of a perceived humiliation of journalists by the Deputy governor. According to Luka, the Deputy Governor had asked journalists who were in his office on an invitation to cover a meeting to go out as they were not needed there. “The Chapel wishes to express dismay that the action of the deputy governor is uncalled for and is capable of jeopardizing the working relationship between them and the office of the deputy governor,” the statement stated inter alia. The chapel secretary added that the journalists felt scorned by the manner the Deputy governor addressed them after waiting for him for minutes to take a report of the meeting they were officially invited to. The release stated that the Correspondents Chapel felt slighted by the manner Tela addressed them in the presence of some stakeholders, adding that the Deputy governor’s approach was unpleasant.
