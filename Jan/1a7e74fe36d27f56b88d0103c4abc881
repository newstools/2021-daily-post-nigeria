The Senator representing Ondo South Senatorial District at the National Assembly, Nicholas Tofowomo on Saturday lauded Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State over the order directing herdsmen to quit forest reserves within seven days. According to Tofowomo who is a member of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, the governor’s move will not only curb the rising cases of banditry and kidnapping in the state but will also allow the government to identify law-abiding herdsmen from those on a criminal mission in the state. In a statement signed by the Senator’s Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Akinrinlola Olumide, Akeredolu was advised to take a step further by giving legal backing to the order. Tofowomo added that the herders have nothing to worry about with the registration process if they have nothing to hide over their presence in the forest. “While declaring my total support for the decision of the governor to evict criminals from our forest reserves with the registration of genuine herdsmen and farmers who are into businesses in Ondo State, I urge him to take a step further by making it a law.” “He should package a law to the State House of Assembly to put an end to banditry, and kidnapping being orchestrated by the bad eggs among the Fulanis who are hiding under the guise of herdsmen. “With that, criminals would be separated from those doing genuine businesses in Ondo State. It is only a bandit that would support a bandit and it is only a kidnapper that would support a kidnapper. “I stand with Mr Governor on his decision. And I advise all the genuine herdsmen to vacate the forest reserves and obey the governor’s directive by going through the appropriate ministry for registration.”
