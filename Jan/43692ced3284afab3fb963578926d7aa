Manchester United captain, Harry Maguire, could be suspended for this weekend’s Premier League clash at Liverpool, if he is booked tonight against Burnley. However, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insists he will play at Turf Moor. Maguire has picked up four yellow cards in 16 appearances this season and another yellow card would rule him out of the trip to Anfield on Sunday. But Solskjaer has no doubts about selecting the England international for the game against Burnley, which could see them go top. “Harry is playing, definitely – that’s for sure,” Solskjaer confirmed to reporters. “You can only take three points from the game that you are playing in. “You cannot put your eyes on games beyond this one.”
