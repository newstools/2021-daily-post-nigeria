Two persons have reportedly died while three others were injured in an accident involving a truck and Toyota Hiace bus at Iwaraja junction on Ipetu-Ijesa highway on Wednesday night. The accident was confirmed in a statement issued on Thursday by Mrs Kudirat Ibrahim, Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Osun. She said the accident occurred about 4km from Iwaraja junction on Ipetu-Ijesa highway on Wednesday at 10:0 p.m. The FRSC boss stated that the accident resulted from over speeding, lack of patience and disregard for road traffic regulations by the two drivers. She said: “A truck with registration number XP 817 EPE collided with another Toyota Hiace Bus with registration number DKA 597 BQ involving six persons. “Two persons lost their lives in the process while three other persons got injured and were rushed to Wesley Hospital, Ilesa, for further treatment. “The corpses have been deposited in a mortuary while free flow of traffic has returned to the affected area.” Ibrahim advised motorists to adhere to road traffic regulations, adding that the command would not spare any road user caught violating road traffic laws.
