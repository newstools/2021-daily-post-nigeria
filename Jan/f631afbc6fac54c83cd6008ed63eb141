Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has insisted that midfielder, Donny van de Beek, is not a failure at Old Trafford. He also said that Van de Beek would make differences in many games for Man United this season. Solskjaer said this after the Holland international was told to pack his bags and leave the club if the Red Devils manager fails to field him in Man United’s Carabao Cup semi-final tie against Manchester City on Wednesday. “Donny has played well when he’s had the chance,” said Solskjaer as quoted by Mirror UK. “I think we are too quick sometimes to jump on, ‘Oh he’s not playing, it’s a failure’. “But with Victor and Fred as examples, it takes a little bit of time, and now they are massively important players in our squad, in our team, which will be the same with Donny. “He has come in, and he is in a midfield group there with quality, challenging with Bruno [Fernandes], Juan [Mata] and Jesse [Lingard]. I have loads of No 10s, loads of central midfielders with Paul [Pogba], Nemanja [Vidic], Scott [McTominay] and Fred, and Donny has done well when he has come in. “He is always ready, he always works hard in training, he’s positive, and he will make differences in many games for us this season. He will grow more and more for next year.” Van de Beek has not featured regularly for Solskjaer’s side since he joined Man United from Ajax for £35million in the 2020 summer transfer window. His last minutes in a Man United shirt were on December 23 in their 2-0 win over Everton in the Carabao Cup.
