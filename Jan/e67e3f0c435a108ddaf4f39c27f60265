The Cross River State Government has demolished a brothel for allegedly being used to accommodate underage persons for prostitution. The government also demolished a building belonging to a suspected kidnapper. The buildings were demolished by the state security outfit, Operation Akpakwu, comprising of the navy, air force, police, army, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and the special adviser to the state government on security. Henry Okokon, the state Security Adviser to Gov. Ben Ayade, said the exercise was one of the ways employed by the government to chase criminals out of the State. He said that the demolition was executed after the security outfit got a court order to demolish the buildings in line with the state Homeland Security law. “This demolition of the buildings is ongoing. Governor Ayade has warned that anyone involved in any form of criminality, or any landlord harbouring any criminal should desist from it. “The bungalow that was demolished belonged to an individual who has been caught in the act of kidnapping, while the brothel was demolished for housing underage persons for prostitution and other illegal activities,” he added. Okokon noted that this was just a warning signal to anyone involved in crime of any form to desist from it before it’s too late.
