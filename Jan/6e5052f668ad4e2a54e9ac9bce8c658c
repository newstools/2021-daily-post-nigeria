Chris Oyakhilome, founder Christ Embassy, has cautioned against criticising pastors and other men of God. Oyakhilome warned that there is a curse on those who criticize pastors and men of God. The clergyman said criticising men of God brings damnation, hence his followers and family members should avoid such. In his New Year message, Oyakhilome said: “I usually tell those in my ministry, don’t criticise God’s people, especially the ministers of God. “Leave them alone for the Bible says ‘whatever they do, they do them unto the Lord’. “You are not the one to accuse another man’s servant. Don’t join anybody to criticise other ministers. “I tell my family members the same thing. Leave them alone because there are curses against those who do so.”
