A political pundit residing in Zamfara State, Alhaji Ahmed Bakers has said that there is no doubt that the Igbo’s are seriously marginalized in the country due to the civil war that occurred between 1966 and 1970. The political analyst explained that the agitation of the Igbos needs to be considered due to the fact that the country is now a united entity. Ahmed noted that since the end of the civil war, the Igbo’s have been denied the seat of the presidency in the country that they are equally entitled to. He said that power drunk politicians from the North and West who are still clamouring for the presidential seat in 2023 do not have any good intention for the unity and peace of the country. “We all are aware that after the civil war in 1970, the then Head of state, General Yakubu Gowon said that there was no Victor no vanquish” he thundered. “I am from the northern part of Nigeria and I am not in any way supporting such selfish ambition because the north has enjoyed power in this country for a long period, likewise the western part of Nigeria.” However, Ahmed advised the Igbo’s to fight for their right through a way that can be justified by everybody in the world. “There is no where in this whole wide world that peace can reign without justice because justice remains the backbone of peace anywhere in the world” He cautioned the people in the corridors of power to ensure that there is justice in Nigeria’s political set up, stressing that the Igbos have contributed a lot to the Nigerian project. “I am, therefore, making a case for the unity of Nigeria because without considering the Igbos for presidency in 2023, the problem of Nigeria’s politics will still remain.” According to him, there is no reason reasonable enough to deny the Igbos their legitimate rights in this political set up of Nigeria.
