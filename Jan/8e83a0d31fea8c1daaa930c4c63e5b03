President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana and Chairman of the ECOWAS Heads of State and Government has called for concerted action against insecurity in the region. Akufo-Addo spoke on Saturday during the 58th Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government. He expressed concern over deadly terror attacks in Mali, northeastern Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Niger. Akufo-Addo noted that the developments must reinforce the conviction that ECOWAS must pursue the actions contained in the decisions of Extraordinary Summit on Terrorism held on 14th September 2019. “This concerted effort, which must be a major priority objective of the community, is the best way for us to address collectively, the security challenge”, he said. Akufo-Addo commended member countries who have kept to their commitments of paying their financial contribution to the US$1 billion ECOWAS Regional Security Fund (ERSF). The Fund was created in support of the 2020-2024 Anti-Terrorism Action Plan.
