Barcelona king, Lionel Messi, has reportedly clashed with goalkeeper, Marc-Andre ter Stegen as the crisis in the club’s dressing room reaches a boiling point, according to Diaro Gol. This is not the first time Messi and the German shot-stopper have fallen out at Barcelona as they have had issues in the past as well. According to the newspaper, the Argentine superstar and the goalkeeper have had a massive bust-up that has seen their relationship falling out completely. The Spanish newspaper said that the reason for their fight is because Messi had opted for Keylor Navas as his first choice during the voting for the FIFA The Best awards. Messi went on to choose Bayern Munich’s Manuel Neuer and Atletico Madrid’s Jan Oblak as his second and third choices. This was rather seen as quite a shocking choice of votes from the South American superstar who generally always voted for his teammates. And his decision of snubbing Marc-Andre ter has not gone down well with the goalkeeper. Diaro Gol reports that Ter Stegen has even reconsidered his future at the club despite renewing his contract with the club recently. Ter Stegen has now reportedly put a hold on his autobiography movie, with the reason being that he wants his movie to be made next season when Messi is expected to leave Camp Nou. It is certain that Messi will leave the club next summer, however, as of now, there seems to be no offer.
