Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has condoled with the Niger Government and the families of a former Military Administrator (MILAD) of Kano State, Col. Aminu Kontagora (Rtd), who succumbed in the early hours of Monday. The governor sent his condolences in a statement issued on Monday in Kano by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Abba Anwar. Ganduje described the former MILAD as an “astute, sound and a gallant military officer“. “Kontagora’s high level of discipline and unassuming pedigree earned him many accolades during his military days, particularly when he was Kano State Military Administrator. “It’s indeed a great loss not only to his families, Niger State Government or the military as an institution, it is equally a great loss to Nigeria and Nigerians’’ Ganduje was quoted as saying in the statement. The governor prayed Allah to forgive all his wrongdoings and reward all his good deeds with Jannatul-Fiddaus.
