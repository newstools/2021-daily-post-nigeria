Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has confirmed the club is looking to sign a new goalkeeper in the January transfer window. This comes amid speculation that Runar Alex Runarsson will leave the club after just four months. The Gunners brought in Runarsson from Dijon in the summer, after Emi Martinez left for Aston Villa. It is understood Runarsson was never Arsenal’s top target and was always seen as a third-choice keeper. The Iceland international has looked nervous in his appearances for the north London club and made a big mistake in the Carabao Cup quarter-final defeat to Manchester City. With Matt Macey also having left the Emirates, means Arsenal need reinforcements between the sticks. When asked if Macey’s departure will see a new keeper come in, Arteta told the media on Monday: “We are assessing the situation with the three positions on the goalkeeping area and we will find a different solution, probably in this window.”
