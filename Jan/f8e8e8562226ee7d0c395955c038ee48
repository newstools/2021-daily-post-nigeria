Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has hinted that the club could complete some transfer deals before the January window closes. Only Mat Ryan and Martin Odegaard have arrived at the Emirates, both on loans from Brighton and Real Madrid respectively. However, Mesut Ozil and Sokratis Papastathopoulos have departed on free transfers. William Saliba and Sead Kolasinac will spend the rest of the season on loans at Nice and Schalke respectively. There could be more ins and outs, before the window slams shut in a few days. Shkodran Mustafi is rumoured to be a target for Liverpool and Ainsley Maitland-Niles will possibly go out on loan. Reiss Nelson could also be sent on loan to a team in the Championship. “I spoke with all of the players about their own situation because they are all aware of the minutes that they are playing and they want to improve their situation. “I am willing to help them. Some of them the club is willing to help them, and we will try to find a solution at the end. But I don’t know whether it’s going to be the case or not,” Arteta said.
