The United Kingdom has announced new measures to control the COVID-19 second wave spread. In a statement to the UK parliament, the Department of Transport announced that from 4 am on January 15, pre-departure testing requirements for all inbound passengers to England will be introduced. Passengers arriving by ship, plane or train will have to take a test up to 3 days before departure and provide evidence of a negative result. Authorities assured that guidance will be available to them and carriers on what to look for, to assure that tests and the results provided meet the standards required. The UK recommended that those within the country stay at home and not travel abroad unless it is for a permitted exempt reason. British nationals positive for COVID-19 were advised not to travel. Carriers may deny boarding if passengers are not in receipt of a qualifying negative test, the statement read. “Fines starting at £500, can be levied on non-compliant passengers. Operators will also be fined for transporting non-compliant passengers”, it warned. However, children under the age of 11 will also not be required to complete pre-departure testing. Also, passengers travelling to England from the UK, Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey will not be affected by the new regulations.
