Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to change Nigeria’s Service Chiefs. Wike said it was high time new strategies were deployed to tackle internal insecurity threats. The governor spoke on Friday at the 2021 Armed Forces Remembrance Day in Port Harcourt. He said the military chiefs had done their best and should go. Wike noted that terrorists, bandits, and killer herdsmen were still causing havoc. “The inability to defeat the Boko Haram insurgency despite years of full military engagement shows that all is not well with our approaches and commitments to the battle against the internal insecurity.” Wike said all Nigerians should be worried by the deteriorating security situation across the country. “We thank the service chiefs for their efforts so far in the battle against the insurgents.” Wike added: “We also align with the concern of citizens that having seemingly reached their wit end, they should now give way for fresh hands and ideas to give the fight the impetus that it so strongly needs to ensure that Boko Haram and killer bandits are comprehensively defeated and smoked out of existence.” The Rivers helmsman stressed that the time has come for the federal government “to stop the pretense, change strategy, seek help from our friends”. He said now is the time to stop killings, free all hostages and improve Nigeria’s security.
