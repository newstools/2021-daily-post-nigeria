Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, the hitherto sole aspirant of the ticket for the Young Progressives Party (YPP) for the forthcoming Anambra governorship election has got a challenger. A former Commissioner in Anambra State, Chief Emma Nkwocha who declared his intention to run for the governorship seat of the state on the platform of the YPP will be slugging it out with Ubah for the ticket of the party. Ubah, the senator representing Anambra South Senatorial zone had earlier boasted that he was the sole aspirant of the party and was sure of clinching the party’s ticket for the November governorship election. Nkwocha who declared his intention to run Tuesday pledged to introduce free education at all levels in Anambra State if elected Governor. Nkwocha who was Commissioner for Information and Culture under the administration of Dr Chinwoke Mbadinuju said that education was a critical resource which he hoped to fully utilize in order to take the State to the next level of development. “Educational opportunities if exploited hold the key for the development of the State and I shall therefore harness our potentials to ensure that our youths are encouraged to attain education at no cost for our accelerated development. “It is not going to be business as usual, we shall embark on a house to house campaign and ensure that no one votes more than once or steals our votes,” he said. He dismissed the statement credited to Imo State governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma that APC would take over Anambra State as an “empty threat” adding that APC had no foothold in Anambra and therefore “Stood the least chance to win the election”.
