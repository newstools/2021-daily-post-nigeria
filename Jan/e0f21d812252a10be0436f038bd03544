Super Falcons captain, Asisat Oshoala, has lost her stepmother. The Barcelona striker announced the news on Sunday night via her Instagram handle. “I still find it difficult to accept, but this is my reality, Allahu Alam. Mummy, I am so short of words right now,” Oshoala said. “I have heard lots of it has happened, it has happened, there is nothing you can do to bring her back, you’re a strong girl… I just can’t process these lines, mummy, you are not gone; it is not possible.” Oshoala also promised her late “mummy” that she would chase all dreams for her. “Had two mothers, now I’m left with just one,” Oshoala wrote on Instagram story.
