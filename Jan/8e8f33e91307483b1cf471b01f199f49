The All Progressives Congress (APC) has revealed plans of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) in 2021. John Akpan Udoedehe, the National Secretary, in a statement on Friday, said so far, CECPC has recorded some achievements within the limitation of the timeframe accorded it. The scribe noted that having got the approval for membership registration, the party is set to undertake the exercise from 25th January 2021 “CECPC is fully set to conduct a total congress for the Party at all levels through a fair and transparent process of electing officials for the various organs of the party that will culminate in its National Convention.” Udoedehe said the leadership is working to create a member-centred party structure, one that guarantees the full participation of all members and accord privileges to members’ trust. He added that recognising time is against the APC, the leadership is doubling its efforts to meet up with the tasks ahead in 2021. Udoedehe assured all members of CECPC’s commitment to lead the process of political change in Nigeria.
