Former Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Jurgen Klopp’s men to beat Jose Mourinho’s side in Thursday nights Premier League clash at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Liverpool head to the game after losing 1-0 to Burnley at Anfield in their last Premier League fixture, while Tottenham defeated Sheffield United 3-1. Writing in a column for BetVictor, Owen said, “Liverpool came into this winless in their last five Premier League matches, scoring in just one of those games. Sunday night’s FA Cup defeat would have been hard to take as the Reds certainly had enough of the game to get a result. “They take on a Spurs side that will no doubt be well organised. I think Jose Mourinho will be willing to give up territory, much like Manchester United did, in the hope he can catch the Reds on the counter. “I think that could work to a certain extent; however, Tottenham’s defence has the tendency to switch off, and they cannot afford to do that here. “This could be a cracker, and I am siding with Liverpool to stop the rot and come away with the win. Tottenham 1, Liverpool 2.” The kick-off time for Tottenham vs Liverpool is 9 pm.
