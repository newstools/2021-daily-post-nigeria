Pope Francis has appointed the Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Rev Matthew Kukah, into the Pontifical Council for human rights, justice and development. This was confirmed in a statement signed by The Director, Social Communications of Sokoto Diocese, Fr. Chris Omotosho, on Tuesday. Omotosho described Kukah’s appointment as a positive development, stating that it would bring about a lot of developments and goodwill to the people of God, especially to the Nigerian Catholics. “By this appointment, Bishop Kukah will join other members of the dicastery (Council) drawn from different regions of the world to advise and promote the holy Father’s concerns on issues of justice and peace, human rights, torture, human trafficking, care of creation and other issues related to the promotion of human dignity and development,” the statement read in part. It added that the appointment which is renewable is for an initial five-year period. The Council is expected to be formally inaugurated on a later date. The appointment was signed on behalf of the Pope by His Eminence, Peter Cardinal Turkson, the Prefect of the Council. Kukah has been in the news recently, following his Christmas Day message. He accused the Nigerian leader of nepotism and that he had reduced others in public life to second class status. Individuals, Northern, Islamic bodies including Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI), Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), among others, have since attacked Kukah. The Muslum Solidarity Forum told the Bishop to leave Sokoto, a warning the presidency condemned in an apparent move to douse tension.
