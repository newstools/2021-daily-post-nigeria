Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said he expects Luke Shaw and Victor Lindelof to be fit to face Burnley in the Premier League on Tuesday at Turf Moor. Solskjaer explained that Shaw and Lindelof were both able to train today ahead of their away Premier League tie with Burnley at Turf Moor, while Paul Pogba and Eric Bailly were only able to partially get involved in the training. Shaw and Lindelof did not feature for Man United in their FA Cup third-round 1-0 win over Watford on Saturday. “All of them trained today,” Solskjaer said at his pre-match press conference on Monday. “Paul [Pogba] and Eric [Bailly] did not do all of it, but Luke [Shaw] and Victor [Lindelof] did all of it. “I’ve got a decent amount of players to pick from. Let us see with Paul and Eric how they’re tomorrow.” Man United are presently in the second position on the Premier League table with goals difference behind leaders Liverpool.
