Two leading members of the Zazzau Emirate, Alhaji Bashir Aminu and Talland Zazzau, Abubakar Pate are dead. Reacting to the sad development, President Muhammadu Buhari expressed sadness over the deaths. Buhari described the death of the two Zazzau leaders, who fell in one swoop, as a double tragedy. Buhari said that “the death of such two prominent figures in Zazzau emirate comes to me as a rude shock not long after the death of former Emir Shehu Idris.” He extended his sympathies to the families of the two leaders, the Zazzau Emirate Council, the Government and people of Kaduna State. “May Allah forgive the gentle souls of the departed and reward their good deeds with paradise,” Buhari said in a statement signed by his media aide, Garba Shehu. He further dispatched a ministerial-level delegation to visit the Zazzau palace on his behalf.
