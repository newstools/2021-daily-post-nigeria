Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Igboho has said that ‘suspected arsonists’ are responsible for the fire incident at his house in Soka, Ibadan. DAILY POST reported on Tuesday morning that a property owned by of Sunday Igboho was set ablaze early Tuesday morning. The building was his Soka residence in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital and no one has been reported injured as at press time. Sunday Igboho became popular after his ultimatum to the Fulani in Oyo. He accused the Northerners of masterminding abductions and killings in the state. After the expiration of the deadline, the house and cars of the Seriki Fulani in Igangan were torched. Igboho denied having a hand in the attack. Today’s inferno at his residence is believed to be a reprisal. But in a tweet confirming the fire incident, the activist only blamed those he described as suspected arsonist, saying, “My house at Soka Ibadan razed down by suspected arsonists.”
