Barcelona needed to fight from a goal down to defeat Rayo Vallecano 2-1 and qualify for the quarter-final of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. Lionel Messi returned to the starting XI after serving a two-match ban. Despite his return, Barca could not find a way through in the opening 45 minutes they dominated. Rayo then grew into the game and took the lead in the second half with a tap-in from Fran Garcia, after keeper Neto spilled the ball right into his path. Barcelona drew level through Messi on a counter-attack, after he was set up by Antoine Griezmann. Soon after, the Catalans took the lead as Jordi Alba set up Frenkie de Jong for another close-range finish Sevilla joined Barca in Fridayâ€™s quarter-final draw by crushing 2019 Copa winners Valencia 3-0 at home.
