Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has penned an emotional farewell message to Mesut Ozil, ahead of his move to Fenerbahce. Ozil flew to Turkey over the weekend to wrap up his transfer from the Gunners. It follows an agreement with the Premier League club, which allows him leave as a free agent in January. Aubameyang, who won the Premier League Golden Boot two seasons ago, benefited significantly from the ammunition supplied by Ozil but also took time to acknowledge the influence Ozil had off the field, as well as on it. The Gabon striker wrote on Instagram: ‘Want to say thanks to you my bro and wish you all the best. “Don’t Need to Talk about how good you are on and off the pitch and how you take care of people. See you soon on Fortnite Bro.” Aubameyang netted a brace as Arsenal returned to winning ways with a 3-0 thumping of Newcastle United on Monday night.
