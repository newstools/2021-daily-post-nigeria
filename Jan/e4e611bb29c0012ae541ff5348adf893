Troops of Operation Lafiya Dole engaged Boko Haram and Islamic State for West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists on Wednesday. The insurgents had waylaid commuters between Gajiram and Monguno in Borno State. They attacked commuters with about 7 gun trucks around the Ari Gamboru and Gasarwa axis along Monguno. The ambush which occurred at about 1pm was a robbery and kidnapping mission. A security official told PRNigeria that acting on credible intelligence, soldiers stormed the scene where they had a fierce encounter. “Apart from killing some of the terrorists, the troops captured five gun trucks and sophisticated weapons. Other fighters escaped in their two remaining vehicles. “Some travellers including women and children who were at the verge of being abducted were rescued by the troops,” the source disclosed.
