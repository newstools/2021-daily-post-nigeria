The January 16 local government election in Kano has polarized the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). On Wednesday, the Kwankwasiyya faction restated its decision to boycott the poll. The Chairman, Shehu Sagagi, told newsmen that the party had sued Kano State Independent Electoral Commission (KANSIEC) for contempt of court. The politician said the KANSIEC Chairman “is either ignorant of the extant laws or he is just behaving like a politician”. Sagagi recalled that the faction set to participate in the election “had earlier gone to court and we won the case.” He noted that only the National Executive Committee (NEC) has the power to appoint an executive. Sagagi insisted the law recognises the leadership of the former caretaker committee led Danladi Muhammad. He recalled that the election of his faction was conducted on December 12, 2020, and they were immediately sworn in. “If the Chairman of KANSIEC has any doubt, let him write a letter to the INEC to seek clarification. They are trying to muscle us and we are not cowards,” he said. Sagagi cautioned the commission against recognising the other faction of the PDP.
