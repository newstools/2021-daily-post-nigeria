Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane has demanded that the contract renewals of Luka Modric, Lucas Vazquez and Sergio Ramos be sorted out quickly. He said this was more important to him than any move for Bayern Munich left-back, David Alaba. The need to bring in a player like Alaba would become urgent if the club fails to reach a contract agreement with Ramos Real Madrid’s Modric and Lucas Vazquez and Bayern’s Alaba are all free agents in June 2021. “Yes, we all want [contracts to be signed],” Zidane said at his pre-match press conference on Saturday. “We want the situation to be sorted as quickly as possible. It’s in everyone’s interests, it would be good for everyone, so hopefully it can be sorted out quickly.” The Frenchman, however, avoided to speak about the speculation about transfer talks with Alaba as Real Madrid battle to defend their title.
