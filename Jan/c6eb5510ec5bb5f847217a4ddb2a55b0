A former Liverpool player, Mark Lawrenson, has predicted Arsenal to secure a 2-1 win against Manchester United in today’s Premier League tie at the Emirates Stadium. Lawrenson believes Arsenal can get all three points against Man United on Saturday evening because Mikel Arteta’s men defeated the Red Devils last November at Old Trafford. Arsenal head to the game after beating Southampton 3-1 in their last game, while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side lost 2-1 to Sheffield United. “I am looking forward to seeing how new signing Martin Odegaard slots into the Arsenal midfield because he is arriving at a good moment,” Lawrenson told BBC Sport. “They have been playing really well of late, ignoring their FA Cup defeat at Southampton last weekend when Mikel Arteta picked a weakened team. “Manchester United were poor in their defeat against Sheffield United on Wednesday, and we have seen that sort of home performance from them too often this season. “Away from home they have been much better, but the Gunners beat them at Old Trafford in November, and I have a feeling they will take the three points at Emirates Stadium too. Arsenal 2, Man United 1.” The kick-off time for Arsenal vs Man United is 6:30 pm. —
