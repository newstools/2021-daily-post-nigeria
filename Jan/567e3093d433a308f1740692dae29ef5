In a viral video, scores of Naval personnel were in celebration mood as they screamed, jumped and hugged each. DAILY POST gathered that officers and men of the Armed Forces across the country received news of the ex-military headsâ€™ departure with joy. Citing insecurity, most Nigerians, including stalwarts of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), repeatedly urged Buhari to remove the Service Chiefs. The Nigerian leader appointed the quartet in July 2015. In December, a former Senator, Rufai Hanga, said Buhari refused to let them go because he was afraid of a coup. Just look at the Jubilation because the Chief of Naval Staff was sackedâ€¦Damn! The rejoicing when Buhariâ€™s tenure comes to an end will be like carnival celebration. pic.twitter.com/aNpbQjkLLD â€” God Save Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ (@gentleojay) January 26, 2021
