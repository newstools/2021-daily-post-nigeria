UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, on Thursday, announced the suspension of its Envoy on Technology, Fabrizio Drummond, over allegations of harassment and inappropriate behaviours. The suspension of the 57-year-old, who hails from Chile, came six days after his appointment as the UN’s first-ever technology envoy. Speaking at a news conference in New York, Guterres said he placed Drummond on leave pending ongoing investigation by the organization into the matter. “The allegations are being investigated, and that’s the right thing to do, and we decided that the precautionary measure to be taken for now should be that he goes on leave. “So, I hope that the investigation will be quickly conducted. “We now have a much more powerful system of investigation of all forms of harassment, and I hope that, based on conclusions, a due process will follow. “This process however belongs to our investigation department to deal with,” he said
