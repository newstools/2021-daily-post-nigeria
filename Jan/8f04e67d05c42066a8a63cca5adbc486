Senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has urged Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams to wake up and save his people from the hands of criminal herdsmen ravaging the region. Giwa, in a statement signed and forwarded to DAILY POST on Wednesday, specifically told Otunba Gani Adams to relinquish his position if he could not sacrifice himself for the Yoruba region. He said,”I have carefully examined the relationship between Otunba Gani Adams and the entire Yoruba. I am bold to say that the Aare Ona Kakanfo is letting his people down. “He is getting too much sleep which I think is contrary to the position he is currently occupying as Aare Ona Kakanfo. “He is not ready to sacrifice himself for his people; this is the time the people in the region need him the most. “When is Aare Ona Kakanfo coming out to lead the fight against the criminal herdsmen that are killing, raping and kidnapping our people? “Does he know the meaning of the position he is holding at all? If an ordinary person can wake up and say he wants to save his people, what stops Otunba Gani Adams from taking the lead?. “There is still time for him to change for the better with a view to allowing the people feel his impacts during this difficult time.”
