The Bayelsa State Government has directed all primary and secondary schools across the state to resume for the 2020/2021 academic session on January 11. It also directed the management of schools in the state to ensure total adherence to the COVID-19 safety guidelines. The State’s Commissioner for Education, Gentle Emelah, disclosed this in a statement at the weekend. Emelah noted that the state government was concerned about the life of every pupil and would not condone flouting of the COVID-19 protocols. He explained that all boarding students were expected to arrive in their schools on January 10. The Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, had since expressed his state’s readiness to reopen schools. “Our commitment to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which has ravaged the entire globe, is total,” Diri said. “Out of the responsibility for the health of our dear children, we decided to close schools on March 26 even before we recorded the index case in Bayelsa, on April 27, 2020. “We seek the cooperation of parents, teachers and other stakeholders to prevent teacher-to-student transmission of the virus and vice versa.”
