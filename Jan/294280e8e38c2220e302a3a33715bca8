But in an interview with Channels Television on Monday, the IGP said that they are carrying illegal arms. He also maintained that all checkpoints in terms of roadblocks are banned. “Vigilante groups are supposed to be working with the communities, gather intelligence and pass to the police. “Vigilante groups are not supposed to carry arms…any of them that does so is carrying illegal arms. “Up till today, checkpoints in terms of roadblocks are banned.
