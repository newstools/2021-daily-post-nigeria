Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has insisted that Governor Rotimi Akaredolu cannot ask Fulanis to vacate Ondo State. Fayemi, who is the Governor of Ekiti State, said this on Monday during the meeting between members of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria and members of the Nigeria Governors Forum. Recall that Akeredolu had given a seven-day ultimatum to Fulani herdsmen to vacate Ondo forest reserves. The Governor had given the quit notice following the high rate of kidnapping in the state, allegedly committed in the forests. However, in his welcome remarks, Fayemi explained that the order pronounced by Akeredolu was misconstrued by the media, particularly, social media. He also said that the meeting was called to resolve the issue of insecurity in the South-West. “Many members of MACBAN were born in the South-West. So, Akeredolu cannot ask Fulani to vacate Ondo State. The area concerned is the forest reserves, and it is about registration and also to work in line with the law,” Fayemi said. “What we are after is the criminals, not Fulani herdsmen, criminals are criminals irrespective of their ethnic group.” Meanwhile, some of the governors in attendance include Ekiti, Ondo, Oyo, Osun, Kebbi and Jigawa States.
