South-West Governors have banned all forms of open grazing in the region. The decision was taken on Monday, after they met with the leadership of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) as well as security chiefs. Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo State), Gboyega Oyetola (Osun State), Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti State), Seyi Makinde (Oyo State), Mohammed Abubakar (Jigawa State) and Abubakar Bagudu (Kebbi State) were all in attendance. Makinde, speaking after the meeting, said: “Today, the South West governors held a security stakeholders’ meeting in Ondo State. The meeting was attended by our brother governors from Kebbi and Jigawa States; security chiefs, South West zone led by the AIG Zone 11 and leaders from the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria. “Collectively, we resolved to ban open grazing in all parts of the South-West. In Oyo State, we already have a law against open grazing which will continue to be implemented by our security agencies. “I restated that we will not permit criminality as a response to criminal actions. Instead we will continue to support our security agencies to do their duties. Also, we will work with our people to face our common enemies – the criminals; kidnappers, armed robbers and bandits.”
