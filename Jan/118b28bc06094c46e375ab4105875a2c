Dr Badmus Habeeb, President, Association of Resident Doctors in University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (ARD-UITH) has warned that fat persons who contract COVID-19 have higher risks of complications. Habeeb made this known to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin on Friday. He explained that the biology of obesity includes impaired immunity, chronic inflammation and blood that’s prone to clot, all of which can worsen COVID-19. He said that fat people were more likely to have other diseases that were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19 than average-weight persons. According to him, such diseases include heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, among others. Habeeb also noted that fat people have baseline respiratory issues which worsen COVID-19 naturally. “Someone with obesity is already at risk of respiratory compromise and we already know that COVID-19 affects the respiratory system majorly. “Therefore, predisposing the already compromised system would further worsen the person’s health,’’ he added. He warned obese people to be careful as they cope poorly with COVID-19 infection.
