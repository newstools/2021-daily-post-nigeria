Some Nigerians detained in Saudi Arabia over expired visas and inability to renew their residency, have appealed for help. In a video seen by DAILY POST, one of them urged the Nigerian government to intervene. “We all here are Nigerians. We have been more than 3, 6, 7 months without any action or information on transportation back to Nigeria. “According to the rules and regulations of this location, you should be here for 2 weeks. But we have been here for more than 5, 6, 7 months. Others have flown back to their country. “Only we Nigerians don’t have any source or way to go back. I’m here on behalf of others to beg for your pardon to help us; assist us please to get back to our country”, he said. The footage caught the attention of the federal government. On Friday, Chairman of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Abike Dabiri-Erewa, confirmed that the nationals would be flown home next week. “There are plans for evacuation: 28, 29 Jan, in two batches of 400 and 200 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs”, she tweeted. The official called for enlightenment campaigns for people to desist from irregular migration. “It’s become very dangerous and more difficult,” the NIDCOM chief added.
