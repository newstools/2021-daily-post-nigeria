Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has said he would have to make a decision on whether to start winger, Hakim Ziyech, against Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City on Sunday evening. Lampard said this while providing the latest update on Ziyech ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash against Man City at Stamford Bridge. The Blues boss explained that the former Ajax star has trained with Chelsea teammates in the last three days. Providing an update on Ziyech, Lampard said on Friday during his pre-match press conference, “He’s fit to train and has trained the last two or three days. “So, I will have to make the decision on whether he’s ready to start [against Man City].” Chelsea head to the game following a 1-1 draw with Aston Villa in their last Premier League tie. The West London club are currently in the 6th position on the Premier League table with 26 points from 16 matches. The kick-off time for Chelsea vs Man City is 5: 30 pm, Nigerian time.
