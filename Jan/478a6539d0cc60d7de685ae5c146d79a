Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed says apart from body protection, his orderly provides him updates of happenings in the country. He said this on Wednesday in Abuja at a ceremony to decorate his Police Orderly, Lucky Moses. Moses was recently promoted by the Police Service Commission (PSC) from the rank of Inspector to Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Mohammed told NAN that Moses has been with him since he was sworn-in as minister in November 2015. “He exhibits his loyalty in various forms. He is pained when he hears anything bad about me and he tries to defend me”, he said. “Moses is like a sounding board for me and every morning, the first thing I ask him is: What are they saying in town about the government and your minister? “There is no popular Radio station and discussion that he does not follow. From his own way of understanding, he will present issues to me. “Sometimes, when some policies of the government are misunderstood, I will take time to explain to him what the people think and what the real situation is.” Mohammed hailed the officer for his loyalty and dedication to duty, The APC chieftain disclosed that Moses never reported sick in the past five years, adding that he allows him to take some days off at intervals. Moses expressed gratitude to God, the PSC, Inspector-General of Police and the minister. The new rank is an additional responsibility to work harder and be more dedicated, the ASP said.
