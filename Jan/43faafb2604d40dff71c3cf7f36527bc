A Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan on Monday dissolved the 11-year-old marriage of a teacher, Mr Yewande Onaola, on grounds of disrespect and infidelity on the part of his wife, Tawakalitu. NAN reports that the Court President, Chief Ademola Odunade, held that the court was duty-bound to put an end to any union that might result in bloodshed. He said that the court dissolved the union in the interest of peace. Odunade granted the custody of the two children produced by the marriage to Tawakalitu. He ordered Yewande to pay N10,000 monthly to Tawakalitu for the children’s upkeep, adding that he should be responsible for their education and other basic needs. Yewande, a resident of Itesiwaju Estate, Ayegun in Ibadan, had told the court that Tawakalitu’s embarrassment of his mother and other immediate family members had become unbearable. ”In 2017, Tawakalitu started by insulting my mother even in her presence without any reason. “I had tried to stop her from such disrespect to me and my relatives, but it occurred to me that she derives pleasure in the habit. “Tawakalitu comes to my school to cause mayhem, thus, embarrassing me and my position. “As if these are not enough, I sometimes catch her in a heart-to-heart talk with men of easy virtue. “The worst of all is that Tawakalitu has been misguiding our two children against me by telling them to disobey my instructions,” he submitted. Responding, Tawakalitu consented to the marriage dissolution but denied most of the allegations against her. She told the court that her mother-in-law never wished her well. “Yewande is an unrepentant drunkard, besides being a nag who keeps complaining of minor issues. “He is a cheat, he is in a romantic affair with my friend’s maid. “I don’t know how I offended his mother, she keeps raining curses on me,” she said. Tawakalitu added that Yewande poured hot oil on her breasts during an argument.
