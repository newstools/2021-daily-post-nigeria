Abia State Governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, has assured residents of Aba that the era of “Dubai roads” is gone in the city, as his administration has set standards that must be followed by others. Ikpeazu while commissioning the 2.3-kilometre Osusu Road, Aba, and 3 other roads on Monday, appealed to the people of the State to work hard to protect roads done in their areas. After expressing satisfaction with the completion of the roads, the Governor noted that Osusu Road is of great economic value to the State, as it is one of the gateways to the famous Ariaria International Market in Aba. He further stated that his administration had so far constructed 5 other access roads to the Ariaria area of the State. The Governor said that his administration did its best in giving the people a quality road using the rigid pavement technology which is a sure way to prolong the lifespan of roads. He added that the era of “Dubai roads” is gone in the state as his administration is poised to give Abians roads of the highest quality using the rigid pavement technology which is now the minimum standard of the State Government. “The era of ‘Dubai roads’ is gone in Aba and Abia State. Our Government is committed to executing durable road projects using the cement pavement technology in Aba in particular and other necessary parts of Abia in general. “This is the standard we have set for ourselves from the inception of this administration and I am confident that whoever succeeds us will be resisted by Ndi Abia if he or she attempts to construct the “Dubai roads” that we saw in the past in this state. The era of ‘Dubai roads’ is gone for good and there is no looking back”, he added. Ikpeazu also urged residents of Osusu and those of other newly commissioned roads to set up a task force to protect the roads against vandalism and assured that Okigwe, Immaculate, Cemetery, ABSUTH and other ongoing road projects in Aba will soon be completed and commissioned.
