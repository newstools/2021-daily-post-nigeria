Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki on Monday reacted to the death of David Ntekim-Rex, a computer prodigy that was allegedly shot by armed robbers but denied treatment by hospital due to lack of police report. Saraki who was Senate President when the Compulsory Treatment and Care for Victims of Gunshot Act (2017)’ was passed called for the prosecution of anyone found culpable in the death of Ntekim-Rex. According to reports on social media, the late computer expert was allegedly robbed and shot around Jibowu in Lagos, however, instead of getting the victim medical attention, policemen at the scene rather focused on investigating the crime. Also, the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) and other hospitals allegedly refused to treat him due to the nature of the wound despite the existence of the Compulsory Treatment and Care for Victims of Gunshot Act (2017). Saraki in a tweet described the death of the young man as heartbreaking. “Learning that David Ntekim-Rex died despite existing laws that we passed during the 8th Senate to mitigate against such occurrences is truly heartbreaking. My heartfelt prayers are with his loved ones at this truly difficult time. “I hope that all those that are found to have been negligent in this case are quickly apprehended and tried under the ‘Compulsory Treatment and Care for Victims of Gunshot Act (2017)’ to ensure that no family ever has to suffer such a loss again.”
