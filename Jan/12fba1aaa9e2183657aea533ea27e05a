Dan Nwafor, a factional chairman of the All Progressives Congress in Imo State, has accused the National Caretaker Committee of the party led by Malam Buni of attempting to use the new registration of members to divide the party. Nwafor raised the alarm while briefing journalists in Owerri last weekend. He disclosed that his leadership in the State had sued the National Caretaker Committee over plans to embark on fresh registration of party members across the country, in a bid to sideline some integral members of the party. Nwafor showed journalists a copy of the court paper dated January 20, 2021, which was filed at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The claimants in the suit are Nwafor and elected officials of Imo APC, while the defendants are the APC and Senator Akpan Udoedehe. The claimants are praying the court to, among others, declare that it is their right, as elected officials of the Imo APC, to receive from the APC national headquarters, the documents to be used for the fresh registration of party members in the state. They are praying the court to make “an order of injunction restraining the defendants, the National Working Committee, the National Executive Committee and or any national officers of the party from derogating or interfering with the functions of the claimants as the elected officers of the All Progressives Congress, Imo State chapter.” Nwafor said though it took courage to fight impunity in the party, he would pursue the suit to a logical conclusion.
