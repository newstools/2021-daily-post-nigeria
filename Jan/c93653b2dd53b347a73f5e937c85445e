Yoruba One Voice (YOV), on Wednesday, urged the Lagos State Government to urgently inaugurate the Southwest Security Network (Amotekun) in the state. The group expressed concern about the spate of insecurity. YOV wondered why it took Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu “almost a year to inaugurate the outfit”. The Secretary General, Shina Okanlomo, pointed out that Amotekun was already operating fully in other states in the region. Okanlomo raised alarm about activities of robbers and other criminals in Lagos. “Nigerians in the diaspora are worried. None can contemplate coming to Nigeria without giving a thought about the porous security situation in the country. Lagos tops on the list of volatile states. “This is not unconnected with the activities of cultists and ritualists that have been terrorising. Amotekun bill was signed into law in March last year and up till now, the security outfit is yet to begin operation in Lagos.” Okanlomo warned that further delay in the take off portends danger. The scribe said investors will not risk taking their money to a place where security “cannot be guaranteed”. YOV commended Ogun, Oyo and others states where the governments have displayed total commitment to Amotekun and had given the formation required funding and equipment.
