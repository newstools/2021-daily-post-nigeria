Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has insisted that what Mesut Ozil did for the club, will not be damaged by the way his time at the Emirates ended Arteta, speaking ahead of the FA Cup clash against Newcastle, says Ozil’s record with the Gunners is “unquestionable”, even if he never plays another minute for the club. Arsenal had gone eight years without silverware when the 32-year-old joined from Real Madrid in 2013. In his first season, he helped Arsene Wenger’s side clinch the FA Cup. The Gunners went on to win the trophy three more times during Ozil’s stay. In total, Ozil contributed 33 goals and 54 assists in 184 Premier League games. However, he has not played for the club since March and has left out of their squads for the first half of the 2020/2021 campaign. A January exit now looks a real possibility for Ozil, with Fenerbahce hoping to sign him An exit in the coming weeks would deny Ozil the chance of a proper send-off from the supporters. But Arteta believes that whatever happens this month or in the summer, when Ozil’s contract is due to expire, the player’s legacy at Arsenal is already secured. “What Mesut has done at the football club is unquestionable and that will stay. “It doesn’t matter if he plays two more games, 10 more games or none. “I think what he has done is there for the records, the history of the club and his contribution, nobody can discuss that,” Arteta said.
