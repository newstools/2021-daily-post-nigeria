A Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho, made good on his threat to expel Fulanis from Igangan in Oyo State. Igangan is a community in Ibarapa North Local Government Area. Last Friday, Igboho and his supporters stormed the area and gave the Fulani one week to leave. The grassroots mobilizer issued the deadline when he confronted the Seriki Fulani, Saliu Kadri. Igboho accused Kadriâ€™s subjects of killing Yoruba individuals. He listed the assassination of Oyo businessman, Fatai Aborode, Alhaja Serifat Adisa and her children, an Igangan prince, among others. Igboho disclosed he acted on the request of traditional rulers. The monarchs protested they were helpless about incessant killings and kidnappings. The Oyo State Government condemned the quit notice. Governor Seyi Makinde warned against eviction of any ethic group and vowed to deal with troublemakers. Igboho has called his bluff as he ordered the Fulani out today. Video:
