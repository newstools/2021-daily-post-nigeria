Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, is confident Timo Werner will improve in front of goal, despite his late miss in their 1-0 win over Fulham on Saturday. The Blues were struggling to break down the hosts, who were reduced to 10 men shortly before half time. But Mason Mount’s goal with 12 minutes left secured a crucial win for Lampard’s side. Werner however had a late chance to seal the game as he was put clean through on goal, but the Germany striker failed to hit the target with his shot. Lampard praised Werner’s positioning and believes the goals will come for the £47.5 million signing. Asked if Werner is short of confidence in front of goal, Lampard told Sky Sports: “I don’t know, I think it’s normal, I think if you don’t score as regularly as you want, he scored last week in the FA Cup. “But those are goals I’ve seen him score many a time. His bread and butter is going through like that and scoring and it happens. “He has to just keep working, it’s the only way out of it. “I was delighted to see him to get through [on goal], he likes to be in those positions, we’re getting him in positions there when he came on and he will score.”
