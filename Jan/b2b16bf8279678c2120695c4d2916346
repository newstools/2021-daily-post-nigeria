Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has praised his players for how they controlled the game, following a 2-0 win over Celta Vigo on Saturday. Lucas Vazquez and Marco Asensio both scored for Los Blancos, as they went top of the league for at least 12 hours. Zidane was pleased with how Madrid contained Celta Vigo’s dangerous players and imposed their own game. “They’re the most in-form team we’ve played. We had difficulties, but we controlled the game. We pressed them high up, we didn’t let their good players play. “We’re always better when we go for the game. We have more problems sometimes when we’re in our half. “Our style is to go for the game, and the pressing of the front three is important,” he told reporters.
