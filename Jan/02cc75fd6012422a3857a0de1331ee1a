The Joint Action Committee of Senior staff Associations of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU), Federal University Gusau wing, Tuesday, embarked on a peaceful protest over non-implementation of IPPIS, minimum wage, and arrears by the federal government. Addressing newsmen after the protest in Gusau, the Chairman of the Joint Task Committee of NASU and SSANU, Malam Mudassir Musa explained that the non seriousness shown by the federal government has affected their work in the last one year. Musa said that several official letters have been served to the federal government, National Universities Commission and other relevant authorities on their demand but all to no avail. “What we are demanding from the Federal Government to implement include, paying our minimum wage, arrears, correcting IPPIS irregularities, and paying their outstanding earned allowances from February last year to date but we don’t know why we are being neglected without listening to our clarion appeals” he lamented. According to him, many staff of the University have been denied their monthly salary since February 2020 due to IPPS. “From the beginning of the IPPIS Programme, which the Federal government asked us to register our names in January last year to date, our staff have not been receiving their Salaries despite several calls by our two unions to the Federal government yet no reason reasonable has been given for not implementing our rights.” The workers spokesman also called on the federal government to as a matter of urgency come to their rescue especially by implementing the IPPIS, minimum wage arrears and other promises made to them. Addressing the protesters, the Deputy Vice Chancellor in-Charge of Administration, Dr. Ahmad Galadima, sympathized with them over their grievances and promised that their demand will be channel to the appropriate authorities for prompt action.
