Mai Mala Buni, the National Caretaker Committee Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has disclosed that those who undermine the party’s registration and revalidation exercise will be punished. The Yobe Governor spoke on Wednesday when he inaugurated the Committee for Membership Registration/Revalidation Exercise in Abuja. The team is chaired by Niger State Governor, Sani Bello. Buni said the process was to reposition and strengthen the party, recalling that the last membership drive was in 2014. He pointed out that APC had, in the last seven years, received millions of politicians, including the ones who left other political parties but were yet to be registered. “Similarly millions of youth who attained the age of 18 years and above have joined the party within this period could not be registered. Again, others who had left the party still have their names in the register. “The registration and revalidation exercise, therefore, provides the opportunity for both new and old members to register and update their membership in the party, and for the party to expunge names of those who had left so as to have a clean and up to date membership register.” Buni said the chairman and members of the committee were carefully selected based on their capacity and the confidence the party has in them. The governor expressed confidence that APC membership figures would surge into quadruples to further prove that it is Nigeria’s largest and leading political party. “Let me make it abundantly clear that the party would not condone any act of sabotage of denying anyone or group of persons from registering. The party would deal decisively with anyone or group who attempts to hijack the exercise. “Everyone must be allowed and given the chance to register. The party has adequate backup materials to ensure a successful exercise and no one is disenfranchised”, he added.
