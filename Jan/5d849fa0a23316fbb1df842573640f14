Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has taken the blame for their missed opportunity against Liverpool and apologized to his team-mates after the game, the UK Metro reports. The 27-year-old put in a strong performance for United, with Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford among those well below-par. However, the game’s best chance fell to the Frenchman. Pogba trapped Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s cross and pulled the trigger 10-yards from goal, firing straight at Alisson Becker, when a shot either side of the Brazilian would have been a certain goal. If he’d scored, United would be four points clear of Man City at the top and six points clear of Liverpool. It would have also been the Reds’ first Anfield defeat since April 2017. Pogba recoiled in agony after missing the chance and was still furious in the dressing-room after the final whistle. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reportedly told the World Cup winner to ‘forget’ the sitter, as Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay sympathised with their team-mate.
