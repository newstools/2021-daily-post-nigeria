A clash between two rival cult groups has allegedly claimed four lives in Bakassi local government area of Cross River State. Atabong, an eyewitness, said though no particular cult group has been identified, the attack was very fierce. He said the clash started on Thursday with the killing of one person at Ekpri Ikang and raged till Saturday night after another person was killed on Friday and two others on Saturday, “I do not know the specific groups involved in the war. But I can tell you that we have been experiencing regular gunshots and people running helter-skelter because of one group chasing members of the other group” He pointed out that the killings on Friday and Saturday seemed to be retaliation by groups for the killing of their members. “Many people in Bakassi have deserted their homes and communities and have run to the neighbouring communities and bushes to avoid being caught by strange fire and attack. “We are at a loss and most of us do not even know what is the cause of the fight and to avoid being caught in the middle of the violence, we decided to stay away”. Meanwhile, the economic, political and social activities including government official function have been seriously affected as workers are nowhere to be seen in their offices. When DAILY POST called the Permanent Secretary on security, Dr Alfred Mboto, the Chairman, Bakassi local government council, Hon Iyadim Amboni Iyadim and the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, none of them picked their calls.
