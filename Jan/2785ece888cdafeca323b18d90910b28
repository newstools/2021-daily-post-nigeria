The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested a legal practitioner, Bardi Robert. The lawyer was arrested on Wednesday in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC spokesman, in a statement on Thursday, said the suspect allegedly eloped with funds awarded by Rivers State High Court. Robert is accused of collecting the money on behalf of his client, Igwe Ugochukwu, and “converted to personal use”. He allegedly received the judgment fund in three tranches – N10,000,000, N737,187, and N4,975,000. EFCC alerted that the alleged accomplice, Obinna Friday Egwom, is still at large. “The suspect would be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded”, the commission added.
