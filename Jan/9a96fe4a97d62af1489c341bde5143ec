The member representing Nnewi North, Nnewi South and Ekwusigo Federal constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon Chris Azubogu has said that Anambra State may be used as a testing ground for the proposed amendment of the electoral act by the National Assembly. Azubogu made the assertions during a gathering of the members of the Peoples Democratic Party in Awka. He said,”The forthcoming election is going to be an unusual election, and you are aware that the national assembly is planning to amend parts of the electoral act. What that means is that Anambra may be used as a guinea pig. “This is the reason the PDP should ensure that it fields it’s best candidate and also someone it is sure of, to avoid errors.” “I’ll advise, the ticket of the PDP is a good ticket, and I can tell you that anybody that will take it on behalf of our party and carry all of us along will win this election. He must be ready to show Anambra people what it takes to be a leader and what it takes to win an election. “For our party, we are grossly disadvantaged in this election. I don’t want to dabble into it but if you know the extent of battle we are going to get into, we will get prepared for that battle. We are in a democracy. I am a lawmaker. They must make a choice. But the PDP remains a better choice for Anambra State.”
