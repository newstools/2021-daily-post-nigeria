Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho, has revealed what he saw at the compound of Seriki Fulani, Saliu Kadri when he (Igboho) AND his supporters stormed the Fulani leader’s home last week. The grassroots mobilizer and hundreds of his followers had stormed Kadri’s home where they confronted the Seriki and issued a seven-day ultimatum to Fulanis in the area to quit. Igboho had last week given the Fulani residing and doing business in Igangan, Ibarapa North Local Government of Oyo State a 7-day ultimatum to leave the area. In a tweet on Sunday, Igboho said he saw all manners of expensive cars at the Seriki’s compound and questioned him about them. “I saw different expensive vehicles, such as Range Rover Sport, Toyota Venza, Camry and more in the compound of the Seriki. “I asked him if it was with the proceeds from the cattle that he sold that he was able to buy the expensive vehicles, some of which costs as much as N38m.” The Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has ordered for the arrest of Igboho according to Garba Shehu, President Muhammadu Buhari’s Spokesman. This was after he made good his threat to evict Fulani from Igangan at the weekend. He listed the assassination of Oyo businessman, Fatai Aborode, Alhaja Serifat Adisa and her children, an Igangan prince, among others.
