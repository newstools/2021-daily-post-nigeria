Nigerian ace comedian, Alibaba, has warned Nigerians that COVID-19 is real. Alibaba, real name, Atunyota Akpobome, in an Instagram post on Monday, disclosed that he witnessed people die from coronavirus. Alibaba, 55, had spent the Christmas and New Year holidays in isolation. He told Nigerians not to let anyone make them believe that COVID-19 is a scam. “I just came out of isolation. Several people died while I was there. Some of my close friends knew and they were very supportive”, Alibaba wrote. He thanked the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and the health workers “risking their lives to keep others alive”. “Observe all the protocols, people are dying and it’s not a joke. In fact, anyone who says COVID is a scam is a compound idiot and a fool”, Alibaba added. Video:
