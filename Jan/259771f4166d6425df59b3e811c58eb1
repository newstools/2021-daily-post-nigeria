Former Liverpool player, Mark Lawrenson, has predicted Manchester United to secure a 2-0 win against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Wednesday night. Lawrenson also backed Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City to beat Aston Villa 3-0 at The Etihad Stadium tonight. Providing his predictions, Lawrenson told BBC Sport: “Fulham were a bit unlucky to be beaten by Chelsea on Saturday, but Manchester United has been like a machine on the road this season, with seven wins and two draws from nine games. “I am going with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side to win here, which will be enough to put them back on top regardless of how Leicester and Manchester City get on beforehand. Fulham 0, Man United 2.” Speaking on the Man City vs Aston Villa game, Lawrenson said, “A Coronavirus outbreak at Aston Villa means their first team have not played since they went to Old Trafford on New Year’s Day, which was the best part of three weeks ago. “The Villa players who didn’t test positive will still have trained so they will be fit, but match sharpness will be an issue – you lose your touch when you do not play for that amount of time. “For the ones who did have COVID-19, we do not know if they’ll be suffering any long-term effects. “Their situation is far from ideal in any circumstance, but it is especially tough with them going to Etihad Stadium to face a Manchester City side who are going extremely well. “By beating Crystal Palace on Sunday, City became the first top-flight team to win five successive league games this season, and I’m backing Pep Guardiola’s side to make it six in a row here. “That should probably be enough to send them top – for a couple of hours at least. Man City 3, Aston Villa 0.” The kick-off time for Fulham vs Man United is 9:15 pm, while that of Man City vs Aston Villa is 7 pm.
