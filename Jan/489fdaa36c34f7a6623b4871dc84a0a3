Donald Trump in his last day as the President of the United States of America has granted pardoned to American rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black. Lil Wayne in 2020 had pleaded guilty to illegally possessing a loaded weapon on a private jet while travelling to Miami. Also pardoned is Kodak Black who is in federal prison after pleading guilty to a firearm possession charge. Trump also pardoned his former campaign manager, Steve Bannon, former Detroit Mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick among other 100 on the list. However, Wikileaks’ Julian Assange and Edward Snowden were not on the list. Lil Wayne’s pardon may not come as a surprise as the Grammy award-winning rapper had endorsed Trump for re-election in October 2020.
