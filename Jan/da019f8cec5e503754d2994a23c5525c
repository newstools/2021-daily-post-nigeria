World Heavyweight Champion, Anthony Joshua, has admitted he is nearing the end of his career, hinting that he has a maximum of five years left before retirement. The 31-year-old could be close to the most significant period of his career, with his camp in talks over two massive unification fights against Tyson Fury in 2021. Since he made his pro debut in 2013, Joshua has become a two-time champion. The Briton regained his WBA, IBF and WBO titles in a 2019 rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr and defended them with a knockout win over Kubrat Pulev last month. “This isn’t the start of my career. I’m coming towards the end of my career,” Joshua told Sky Sports News. “I’m not someone who lives in the moment and thinks that everything is just like for now. I’m always planning ahead so I’m coming towards the end of my career. “Five years left and that’s basically an Olympic cycle. I’ve got an Olympic cycle and a little bit more left, so when you see the next Olympics happen is when I’ll be coming to the end of my career and the next generation will be coming through.”
