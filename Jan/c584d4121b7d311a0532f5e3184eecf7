Facebook Chief Executive Officer, Mark Zuckerberg, has announced an indefinite ban on US President Donald Trump from the platform. Zuckerberg said the decision became necessary due to the outgoing president’s efforts to incite the violence in the US capital. According to an earlier 24-hour ban on the American leader as announced on Wednesday was extended because of Trump’s “use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.” Facebook is not the only social media platform to have locked out Trump over his unsubstantiated claims about Joe Biden’s victory in the November 3 presidential election which have incited the angry mob that stormed the US Capitol. Trump’s favourite platform, Twitter, yesterday shot him off for 12 hours, while Snapchat confirmed Thursday that it locked Trump out. “We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,” Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page. “Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.” President Donald Trump until this moment has refused to concede defeat to the Democratic Party candidate, Joe Biden who won the election with over 300 Electoral College votes.
