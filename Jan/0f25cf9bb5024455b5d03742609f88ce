Armed men have abducted the district head of Mayo-Farang in Mayo-Belwa Local Government Area of Adamawa State, Ardo Mustapha Ardo Ahmadu. The monarch who is also the Sarkin Noman Adamawa, was abducted a few hours after he returned to the state from Abuja, sources told DAILY POST on Tuesday. According to the sources, the gunmen struck the palace of the monarch around midnight of Monday and abducted him after subduing the palace guards. “The whole town was gripped by tension as gunshots rented the air. The monarch was abducted despite the presence of the palace guards because the gunmen were much better armed,” one of the sources said. The Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer, Suleiman Nguroje who confirmed the incident, said the command had sent a massive deployment to rescue the monarch and round up the gunmen. Nguroje said, “Yes it is true the traditional ruler was kidnapped between 12 am to 1:00 am. So much deployment was made to rescue the victim and possibly to arrest the culprits.” He added that the police command was willing to hand financial reward to anyone with information that could help with getting the culprits arrested and the victim freed. It would be recalled that the abduction of the village head occurred hours after the new Commissioner of Police in the state, CP Aliyu Adamau, addressed the media in the state capital, Yola, vowing to practice visibility policing to deter crime and gave Adamawa citizens assurance of protection.
