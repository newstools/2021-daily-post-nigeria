Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has said that midfielder, N’Golo Kante’s best position is in a ‘double six’. Tuchel also hailed Kante as a ‘world class’ midfielder who played a vital role in the World Cup win for France. Kante has been out of action for three weeks with a hamstring injury. The former Leicester City star also missed Chelsea’s 0-0 draw with Wolves on Wednesday night at Stamford Bridge. Kante could be in contention in Chelsea’s next game against Burnley on Sunday. “I think he [kante] is the strongest in the double-six, in the centre, the heart of the game,” Tuchel was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying. “For me, he is a double six because we can use his energy, his range in his game, his ability to recover the ball. “For me, he is a guy who is a big, big helper for everybody, with the mentality of a water-carrier – but at the same time a world class player who played a crucial role in the World Cup win for France. “That’s why it is super important for me to have him.” EPL: Tuchel rates Chelsea's title chances after 0-0 draw with Wolves Chelsea vs Wolves: Lampard speaks on playing Kante in EPL clash Chelsea vs Wolves: Abramovich sets target for Tuchel as he replaces Lampard
