Reno Omokri, a former presidential aide, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for sacking the Service Chiefs. Omokri also described the appointment of the incoming Service Chiefs as ‘Good riddance to bad rubbish’. Recall that the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the President, Femi Adesina, on Tuesday disclosed that Buhari sacked his Service Chiefs with immediate effect. Adesina wrote on Twitter, “PMB appoints new Service Chiefs. Maj Gen LEO Irabor, CDS, Maj Gen I Attahiru, Army, Rear Adm AZ Gambo, Navy, AVM IO Alao, Air Force. “He congratulates outgoing Service Chiefs on efforts to bring enduring peace to the country.” Reacting, Omokri, in a tweet via his Twitter handle, said it was disappointing that Buhari maintained his practice of appointing largely Northern Muslim males but admits that ‘half bread is better than none’. Omokri tweeted: “I commend General @MBuhari for listening to voices of reason and sacking his clueless and nepotistic service chiefs. “Good riddance to bad rubbish. It is disappointing that he maintained his practice of appointing largely Northern Muslim males, but half bread is better than none.”
