Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, is considering bringing back former manager Avram Grant to work with current boss Frank Lampard, according to Sky Sports. The Russian billionaire believes Grant’s experience could provide invaluable support to Lampard and his staff. Chelsea has won just one of their last six Premier League fixtures and has dropped to ninth place in the table. Grant believes his strengths lie as a team manager rather than behind the scenes, so potentially the 65-year-old’s return to Stamford Bridge could be on a short-term basis. In 2018, the former Portsmouth and West Ham boss had a spell as manager of Indian Super League team NorthEast United. Before that, Grant managed Ghana and led the Black Stars to the Africa Cup of Nations final in 2015, losing to Ivory Coast on penalties. Grant guided Chelsea to the Champions League final in 2008 and Lampard scored 20 goals during 40 appearances in all competitions for the Blues during that season.
