The Osun State Government has announced the discovery of five cases of the deadly B117 strain of COVID-19 in the state. The B117 strain of COVID-19 was firstly recorded in the United Kingdom. This is coming barely five days after the Chairman Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha announced that Nigeria has recorded four cases of COVID-19 B117 strain. The Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Funke Egbemode, confirmed the discovery of the COVID-19 in a public announcement on Sunday evening. This new strain, according to the commissioner, spreads faster and kills quicker. “If it continues to grow, more citizens will become vulnerable and those with underlying ailments more endangered.” adding that the government is extremely concerned about the days ahead due to the continued disregard and defiance for safety protocols in the state. “We cannot continue to act like COVID-19 is not real. It is not just a sad reality but one that has changed the momentum with this more deadly strain. “Citizens are enjoined to scale up their personal responsibility for safety by complying with all the non-pharmaceutical protocols outlined by the government, to avoid tragic consequences,” she added.
