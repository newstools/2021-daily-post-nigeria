Ayo Adebajo, a chieftain of the Yoruba sociopolitical organization, Afenifere has given his opinion on why Southeast is agitating for Biafra. Adebajo said Igbos feel the Nigerian 1999 constitution does not address their issues, hence the agitation for Biafra. He spoke at the 18th Daily Trust Dialogue held in Abuja yesterday. The Afenifere chieftain described the current Nigeria’s constitution as fraudulent. “All the agitation about Biafran separation is because they (Igbos) feel excluded under the constitution. “The constitution, we have now is a fraudulent constitution. It is not our constitution. “Most importantly, it has failed, and everybody testified to this fact. It is simply not working.”
