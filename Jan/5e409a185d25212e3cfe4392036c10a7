The wounded soldier has been evacuated to a military medical facility and is responding positively to treatment”. The Acting Director also noted that the renewed onslaught against the remnants of Boko Haram/Islamic State’s West Africa Province criminals by the dogged troops of Operation TURA TAKAIBANGO is indicative of the end of all criminal elements within the North East.
