Oyo State Governor, Engr Seyi Makinde has appealed to former Governor Gbenga Daniel of Ogun State to return to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). DAILY POST recalls that Daniel had, in 2019, declared that he was no longer a member of the PDP or any other political party. The former Governor said he had retired from partisan politics, blaming the unending crisis in the Ogun State chapter of the PDP for his decision. But, on Wednesday, Gov Makinde visited the Asoludero residence of Daniel in Sagamu, where they had a closed-door meeting with former Governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola of Osun and other South West party leaders in attendance. The meeting, it was gathered, was to reconcile the various factions of the party in Ogun and to make Daniel the leader of the PDP in the State. The Oyo State Governor was quoted to have maintained that Daniel was in the best position to provide leadership for the party in the State. According to a statement issued by Daniel’s media office, Makinde said he recognised Daniel’s capacity to reconcile all aggrieved factions of the party in the State, saying he played significant role in his emergence as the PDP governorship candidate in Oyo. “That is why he felt it is important that he takes charge of the party in Ogun State,” the statement noted. ‌Makinde, DAILY POST gathered, expressed confidence that PDP National Working Committee would not have any choice than to agree with the South West line of party leadership if it realises there is unity among leaders of the region. Reacting, Daniel stated that the PDP remained a good brand in Ogun, adding that the only way for the party is to redefine the character of leadership for the party.
