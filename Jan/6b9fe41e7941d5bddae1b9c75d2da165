Real Madrid will not sack manager Zinedine Zidane, despite their shock Copa del Rey defeat to Alcoyano, Goal reports. It is understood that Zidane retains the full support of the club’s board. Madrid was dumped out of the competition against their third-tier opponents, meaning they have lost two chances of potential silverware within a week. Athletic Club had beaten Zidane’s men in the Supercopa de Espana final courtesy of a 3-2 extra-time win. Prior to that, Los Blancos had been held to a 0-0 draw by Osasuna in their last league outing and are now three games without a win. Four points separate them from table-topping neighbours Atletico Madrid in the Spanish top-flight, but Real have played two games more than Diego Simeone’s troops. Zidane is aware his position will come under threat if results do not improve, but for now, has the backing of the club’s hierarchy.
