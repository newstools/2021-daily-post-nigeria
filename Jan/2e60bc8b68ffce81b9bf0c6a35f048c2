He also presented the recorded conversation between his wife and the alleged witch doctor as exhibit before the court. In her defense, Faseyitan told the court that she never wished death on her husband. According to her, “all I wanted was to him in bondage and make him sick, until he serves his purpose.” ”I only told the witch doctor to do it in such a way that people would be convinced that his second wife was responsible for the calamity that befell him,” she said.
