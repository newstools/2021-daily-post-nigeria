Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has confirmed that Brandon Williams and Phil Jones didn’t train with the rest of the Red Devils teammates ahead of their Premier League clash with Fulham on Wednesday night. Solskjaer said this at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday. Man United head to the game following a 0-0 draw with Liverpool in the Premier League last Sunday, while Fulham lost 1-0 to Chelsea. Solskjaer’s side will go top of the Premier League table if they beat Fulham at Craven Cottage. “Well, we have not got the COVID test results yet,” Solskjaer said. “It is almost 38 hours ago since we did the testing, so hopefully we will get them soon. “No, everyone trained this morning, more or less. Brandon [Williams] and Phil Jones didn’t train, but the rest were on the pitch.” The kick-off time for Fulham vs Man United is 9:15 pm.
