A federal lawmaker, Sylvester Ogbaga, has said the Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, remains “a friend” of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Umahi joined the All Progressives Congress (APC) last November. Ogbaga, who represents Abakaliki/ Izzi federal constituency in the House of Representatives, spoke at Isu, Onicha Local Government Area on Sunday. The lawmaker noted that although Umahi was now in the APC, he rose to political stardom via the PDP. ”We have no two governors in Ebonyi, and we expect him as our leader to address the threats to PDP members and the general insecurity in the state. ”It is still surprising that Umahi, who remains our friend and brother, joined APC when we were expecting the party to meet the expectations of Nigerians,” NAN quoted him as saying. Ogbaga commended Umahi for projects executed and urged him “to pay special attention to stomach infrastructure”. He urged President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration to do more to tackle insecurity in Nigeria.
