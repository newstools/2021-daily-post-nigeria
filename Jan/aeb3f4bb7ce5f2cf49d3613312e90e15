The Nigerian government has boasted of winning the war against insecurity in the country. Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, said security agents are working towards protecting Nigerians. Speaking at a press conference in Abuja, the Minister insisted that Nigeria’s security situation under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari was better than 2015. Mohammed also recounted some of the successes security operatives recorded in the course of their duties. He said: “I can say without hesitation that, though Nigeria is facing security challenges, the situation is far better than what we met in 2015. “I can tell you today that the armed forces, the police and other security and intelligence agencies are ramping up their efforts to enhance the security of lives and property across the country, and the results are beginning to show. “Therefore, we will be highlighting, at this press conference, the recent successes recorded by the Armed forces and other security and intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorists, bandits and other criminals. “Since the beginning of this year, which is barely three weeks old, the Armed Forces of Nigeria have neutralised 158 criminal elements across the country. This is in addition to scores of other terrorists and armed bandits killed during airstrikes. “Some 52 criminal elements were arrested, with scores of arms, ammunition and equipment recovered. “Troops have also rescued a total of 17 kidnapped victims across the country.”
