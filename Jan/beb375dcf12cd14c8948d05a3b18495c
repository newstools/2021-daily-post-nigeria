Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has injury concerns over Thomas Partey and Emile Smith Rowe, following their 3-1 win at Southampton on Tuesday night. The Gunners climbed into the top half of the Premier League with the victory. Goals from Nicolas Pepe, Bukayo Saka and Alexandre Lacazette cancelled out Stuart Armstrong’s early opener, to move Arteta’s men into eighth place. While there were plenty of positives to take, there were two big injury concerns for Arteta with Manchester United on the horizon. Both Partey and Smith Rowe were forced off in the second half and will now face a race to be fit for Saturday’s clash at the Emirates. “He [Smith Rowe] was injured for the FA Cup game and we knew that probably today he could not play the whole game. “He had some muscular discomfort and had to come off again. “We had five players in the FA Cup that couldn’t play, [Kieran Tierney] was one of them and Thomas you could see not manage 60 minutes. We don’t know [if it was cramp]… but it was a struggle,” Arteta said after the game.
