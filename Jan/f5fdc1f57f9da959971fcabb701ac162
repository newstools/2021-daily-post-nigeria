Popular Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Adeyemo, well known as Sunday Igboho, has revealed that the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, gave him the sum of N2 million to fuel his car after visiting him. Igboho disclosed this during an Instagram Live Chat with media mogul, Dele Momodu, on Tuesday. According to him, he met Tinubu during the build-up to the Ondo State governorship election, which involved a former Governor of the state, Olusegun Mimiko. Igboho claimed that another former Oyo State governor, Rasheed Ladoja, told him that Tinubu wanted to see him at his Bourdillon residence in Lagos. He then travelled to meet with Tinubu, who persuaded him not to support the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the election, because the party impeached Ladoja as governor in 2006. Tinubu then doled out N2 million for him to fuel his vehicle back to his base. Igboho denied making his money from thuggery, adding that he is a businessman, who is into cars.
