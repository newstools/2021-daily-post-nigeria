The Edo State High Court sitting in Benin, on Wednesday voided the All Progressives Congress (APC) Deputy governorship candidate, Audu Ganiyu, in the September 19, 2020 governorship election. A member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Kadiri Oshoakhemhe, had filed a suit against Ganiyu and two others. The presiding judge, Justice H.A Courage-Ogbebor, while delivering judgment, said Ganiyu presented false information to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in his Form EC9. Ganiyu was Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamuâ€™s running mate during the poll won by Governor Godwin Obaseki of the PDP. In December 2020, a Federal High court in Abuja had disqualified a suit which sought his disqualification in the election. The Action Democratic Party (ADP), which filed the suit, had alleged that Ganiyu presented forged documents to INEC.
