A former Crystal Palace Chairman, Simon Jordan, has told Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, that Anthony Martial will get him sacked from the club if the striker remains a regular part of his team this season. Jordan said this ahead of Man United’s away Premier League fixture with Liverpool on January 17, 2021. Martial has scored just two goals in twelve league appearances for the Red Devils, mostly playing as Man United’s main central striker. But Jordan believes the likes of Martial playing regularly is not good for Solskjaer’s future at Old Trafford. Solskjaer’s men currently sit in the second position on the Premier League table, level on points with reigning champions, Liverpool. “Man United fans are piling in on me, saying ‘you’ve got this agenda against Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’,” Jordan said on talkSPORT. “It’s not an agenda, it’s calling out excellence and saying ‘can you really subscribe to the fact that anytime soon this guy, and this group of players…’ – because some of those players aren’t fit for purpose, Anthony Martial will get you sacked if you have him regularly in your side because he’s not good enough and he’s lightweight. “You look at this and say ‘is he really going to bridge the gap in the cometh the hour, cometh the man moment against [Jurgen] Klopp and against [Pep] Guardiola?’ “He may well do it. He may well beat Klopp next week. I don’t think he will, but I don’t take any satisfaction, I don’t sit there wanting this man out of a job. “I don’t have an agenda, I’m just calling it as I see it. If you want to call it an agenda, that’s peoples perspectives.”
