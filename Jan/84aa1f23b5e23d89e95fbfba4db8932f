Popular Nigerian singer, Ikuforoji Abdulrahman Olaitan, popularly known as Oxlade, has said ‘Headies award’ is not a priority to his career. Oxlade said this during an interview with BBC Pidgin. The ‘Away’ crooner was nominated alongside Tems, Omah Lay, and Bella Schmuda for next rated 2020 award. However, he noted that Headies is just one of the things that motivate artists but certainly not a priority for him. He said: “Headies is not a priority, If I win or earn it I’m grateful but I do not see it as priority for my career. “I just see it as one of those things that motivates you especially when you’re trying to make it in the industry.” He added that he would love to be the biggest afrobeat export from Africa in 5 to 10 years time.
