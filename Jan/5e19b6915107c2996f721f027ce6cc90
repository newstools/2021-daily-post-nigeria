Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has urged Ogoni people to be cautious of politicians and political parties who will lure them with unworkable promises ahead of the 2023 general elections. Governor Wike said this during the commissioning of the Sakpenwa-Bori road in Khana Local Government Area of the state. He said while the Federal government may have failed in its promise to clean-up polluted areas of Ogoni, the Rivers State government under his administration will continue to provide infrastructure for the people. “I am not like the Federal Government. They promised you they will do Ogoni clean up. Has it been cleaned? I promised you road, have I done it? So you can see the difference between our party and their own party. The difference is clear. “When election comes in 2023, they will start another clean up. You people don’t even ask questions. Why is it a year to the election that Ogoni clean up will always commence? Now that there is no election are they doing clean up now? Watch from next year they will start clean up,” Wike said. Commissioning the project, Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi commended Governor Wike for his infrastructural strides in Rivers State.
