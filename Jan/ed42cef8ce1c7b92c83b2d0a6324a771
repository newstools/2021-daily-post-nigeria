Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has lashed out at Folarin Balogun’s agent, over the striker’s future. Speaking ahead of the FA Cup clash against Newcastle, Arteta on Thursday said he was unsure about Folarin’s representatives. Talks have been ongoing for months between the two parties over a new contract, with the 19-year-old’s current deal due to expire at the end of the season. But the discussions have yet to find an agreement, with Arsenal set to lose Folarin for free in the summer. Arteta remains hopeful a deal can still be done but admits he is unsure exactly what Balogun’s agent is thinking. “You need three parties to make a deal. For sure, the club wants to make a deal, the manager wants to make a deal, the player wants to stay and I’m not sure about the agent,” Arteta said. When asked if he thought Balogun’s agent was stopping the talks progressing, Arteta added: “I’m not saying he’s stopping, it’s that we need to find an agreement with him. “We are negotiating with an agent, with a player that wants to stay at the club and we need to find an agreement. Balogun, who is represented by Elite Project Group, has scored twice in five senior appearances for Arsenal.
