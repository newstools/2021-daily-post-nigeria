Kaduna State Government on Thursday arraigned five persons for alleged attempted adultery and organising a nude party. The aborted sex party was scheduled to hold on December 27, 2020. The defendants include Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) spokesman in Kaduna, Abraham Alberah. He is the husband of Aisha Yakubu, owner of Asher Kings and Queens Restaurant, the purported venue. Others were those operating the restaurant, the staff, and customers who organised the party. They were sued before Magistrate Benjamin Nok of the Magistrate Court for allegedly flouting COVID-19 protocols and acting immorally. The prosecution stated that the nude party had already begun when policemen arrived at the scene. According to the charge, credible information was received at Sabon Tasha Police Station about a sex party to hold at Asher Guest Lounge located at Court Road, Sabon Tasha in Chikun Local Government Area at about 19:00 hours. “A team of policemen rushed down to the scene and found the said lounge filled up with over 50 youths both male and female dancing almost naked with no face mask on any of them. “On sighting the policemen, the said youths jumped from one corner to the other and escaped over the fence. Three suspects were arrested – Abraham Alberah, Umar Rufai, and Suleiman Lemona. Two others – Chimezie Kenneth, organised the party, and Marvellous Akpan, disseminated the information,” it read. The accused persons pleaded “not guilty” to the charges. The Magistrate granted them bail in the sum of N100,000 each with a surety who must own property in Abuja. The case was adjourned until January 20, 2021.
