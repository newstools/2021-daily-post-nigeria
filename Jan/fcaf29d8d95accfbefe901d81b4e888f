Russia has warmed that there may be scary consequences after Twitter and other social media platforms removed Donald Trump, the outgoing President of the US. The country compared the actions of the platforms to a “nuclear blast in cyber space.” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova said this on Facebook, adding that “It’s not the destruction that’s scary but the consequences. “A blow has been dealt against democratic values proclaimed by the West.” Owners of Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and even Trump’s favourite social media platform, Twitter suspended his accounts last week following the deadly attack on the US Capitol by the outgoing President’s supporters. The attack was said to have been Trump’s final push to stop the confirmation of Joe Biden as the November 3 presidential election winner by the Congress. Twitter has now deleted the President’s account completely, depriving him of his favorite megaphone. The spokesperson added that Trump’s social media ban was one more reason for American authorities to “take care” of their own country instead of criticizing Russia. This was in response to US’ concern over a crackdown on independent media in Russia, among other issues.
