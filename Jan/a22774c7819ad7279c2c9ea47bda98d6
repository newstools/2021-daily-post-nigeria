Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has predicted that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will win the election in all the 44 local governments of the state as well as the 484 wards judging by the massive turn out he saw at his ward number 008 Ganduje Cikin Gari on Saturday. He stated this after casting his ballot in the ongoing local government election on Saturday at Ganduje town of Dawakin Kudu Local Government Area. “It is highly impressive how people turned out to vote and it is peaceful. This shows that the election was accepted by all the people in Kano state. “This gives us confidence, especially as we don’t believe in a caretaker committee to be managing the local governments, therefore, we must have elected officials to manage the affairs of our 44 local councils. “That is why we decided to conduct this election in the local governments to serve, as the end of tenure for those elected three years ago. “You can see that the people are orderly, the people are willing, the people are voting. There is no intimidation, there is no any form of harassment of anybody and they are voting the people that they like. “Our expectation is that we will win all the 44 local governments and the 484 council wars through ballot box and not through intimidation,” Ganduje stated. The governor further called on the people to vote wisely while assuring that those voted for will serve them accordingly. “The message to the people is that they vote for the people that they have confidence in and we assure them that those they vote for will work for them. I “So, we assure them that they should vote wisely and they will get the dividend of democracy,” Ganduje declared.
