Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard’s future is “under serious threat”, following a 3-1 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday, The Athletic reports. The Blues’ winter slump continued against City, with Lampard’s side giving up 18 shots – the most by an opponent at Stamford Bridge in the last seven years. Ilkay Gundogan, Phil Foden and Kevin De Bruyne all scored in the first half to put Pep Guardiola’s men in firm control. Chelsea has now won just one of their last seven matches in all competitions and slipped down the table, with their latest defeat leaving them in 8th place in the table. Pressure is mounting on Lampard and the Blues have already begun drawing up a plan with a view to replacing him if their current slump continues. The manager, who spent 13 years at Chelsea as a player, is not expected to be given any extra time to turn things around due to his status at the club, with the board prepared to act just as ruthlessly as they have done in the past. Chelsea’s board is also aware of growing tensions between Lampard and a number of players within the squad who feel they are being overlooked in favour of his trusted regulars. They face Fulham, Leicester and Wolves in their next three Premier League games, which could be decisive. With Mauricio Pochettino no longer available, the likeliest name in the frame to replace Lampard is Massimiliano Allegri, who has been out of work since leaving Juventus in 2019, after leading the club to five straight Serie A titles.
