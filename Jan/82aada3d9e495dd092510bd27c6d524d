Israel of DMW, has given likely reasons Nigerian singer, Zlatan Ibile and DJ Cuppy are fighting. DJ Cuppy in 2019 produced a hit song ‘Gelato’ featuring Zlatan which made waves at the time. However, things became sour between both artistes after DJ Cuppy cried out on social media that Zlatan blocked her on every platform. Zlatan who kept mute made things worse on Thursday as he denied ever knowing DJ Cuppy during an interview. This got Nigerians talking as some criticized Zlatan for his response. However, Israel, Davido’s Personal Assistant, has commended Zlatan for his response, revealing that DJ Cuppy was a fake friend. According to him, the daughter of billionaire Femi Otedola used Zlatan and never paid him despite the billions received from their hit collabo. On his Instagram page, he wrote: “Kudos to someone like Zlatan who took a bold step by flushing out a fake friend like Cuppy who was just using his head all in the name of her papa, Otedola “Zlatan did a hit collabo with her; ordinary one kobo, he no see. She also took Zlatan to Abuja for her fundraising where she made billions of Naira and didn’t remember Zlatan for one kobo despite no feeding and accommodation. “ Zlatan had to spend his personal money at Transcorp Hilton to cater for everyone including me.”
