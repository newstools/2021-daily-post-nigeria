Former Liverpool and Manchester United striker, Michael Owen, has described the sack of Frank Lampard as Chelsea manager as ‘madness’. Owen feels Lampard deserved more time at Chelsea after guiding the West London club to finish the fourth position on the Premier League table and Champions League qualification last season. Lampard was sacked on Monday by Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, after one year and six months in charge at Stamford Bridge. His last game as Chelsea manager was a 3-1 victory over Luton Town in the FA Cup fourth-round tie on Sunday. Chelsea is currently in the 9th position on the Premier League table with 11 points off leaders Manchester United. Reacting, Owen wrote on Twitter on Monday: “Absolutely staggering decision from @ChelseaFC to sack Frank Lampard. Where do you begin? “Against the odds made top 4 last season and qualified impressively to the knockout stages of the @ChampionsLeague this season. “Bought some good players who will settle in a given time. Madness.”
