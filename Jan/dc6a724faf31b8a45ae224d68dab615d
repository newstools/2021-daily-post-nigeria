Reactions have continued to trail the 7-day ultimatum given to herdsmen to vacate forest reserves across Ondo State by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. The latest is from traditional rulers in the state who on Thursday threw their support behind the governor’s move for unregistered herders to vacate government forest reserves. Briefing journalists in Akure, the state capital shortly after an emergency meeting, the monarchs called on President Muhammadu Buhari to demonstrate to the world that he is the father of all irrespective of ethnic affiliation. The Olukare of Ikare, Oba Akadiri Momoh who spoke on behalf of the monarchs, also appealed to Buhari to advise his aides to always exercise restraints on issues that border on the prevailing insecurity in the country. While frowning at what they described as a deliberate attempt by some persons to twist the governor‘s clear directive as regards the ultimatum, the monarchs said Fulanis like any other ethnic groups are free to live and conduct their legitimate businesses anywhere in the country including Ondo state.
