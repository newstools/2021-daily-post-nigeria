Four people were killed on Tuesday, in a landmine blast in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu. Deputy Commissioner for Security and Politics in Garasbaale, Abdi-Rashid Dubad is among the deceased, according to Dalsan FM station. A local hospital director confirmed six people were injured. Al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for the explosion. The organisation is an active affiliate of the al-Qaeda terrorist group. The United States military has completed the withdrawal of troops from Somalia. The pull out was one of President Donald Trump’s last actions. The personnel trained Somali forces in counter-terror operations. They head to other countries including Kenya and Djibouti, host country of America’s only permanent military base in Africa. On whether President-elect Joe Biden will reverse the withdrawal, U.S. Africa Command spokesman, Col. Chris Karns said it would be “inappropriate to speculate or engage in hypotheticals”.
