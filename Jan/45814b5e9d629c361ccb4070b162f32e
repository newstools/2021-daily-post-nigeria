A civil servant, Moses Ojo, on Monday, prayed a Customary Court in Jikwoyi, Abuja, to grant him a divorce, on grounds that his wife, Martha, was secretly planning to marry another man. NAN reports that Ojo, in his petition, alleged that his wife travels without his consent. ‘My wife wants to kill me, she is planning to marry another man. ”Her lover sent her a text message on preparations for their wedding. ”Martha is also threatening to kill me and inherit my property,” he alleged. The petitioner also told the court that he reported the matter to his in-laws and they advised him to divorce their daughter. However, the respondent has always been absent in court without sending correspondence, to explain why she will be absent from court. The presiding judge, Jemilu Jega, further adjourned the matter until Jan. 26, to enable Martha appear before the court.
