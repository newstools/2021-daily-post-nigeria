Arsenal striker, Alexandre Lacazette, has wasted little time in staking his claim to take Mesut Ozil’s soon-to-be-vacant No.10 shirt. Lacazette, writing on his Instagram stories, promised Ozil his jersey “will be in good care”. Ozil is set to sign for Fenerbahce, with the Turkish giants appearing to announce an unusual no 67 shirt number for him. https://dailypost.ng/2021/01/17/mesut-ozil-confirms-new-shirt-number/ News of Ozil’s imminent departure prompted a scramble between Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for the coveted No.10 shirt he will vacate. The German playmaker has occupied the number since 2018, when he switched from No.11 upon Jack Wilshere’s departure from the Emirates. But it appears Aubameyang has backed down in the pursuit of the No.10 shirt, paving the way for Lacazette to claim his prize. The French striker took to Instagram to post a picture of him and Aubameyang pointing at each other, writing: “When you both want the number 10.” In response, Arsenal captain Aubameyang wrote: “They said they put it away. All yours my bro,” accompanying his note with a number of laughing emojis. Aubameyang will continue wearing Arsenal’s iconic No.14 jersey, which was famously worn by club legend Thierry Henry. But Lacazette is keen to switch from No.9 to No.10., having donned the latter for much of his Lyon career before moving to the Emirates in a £46.5million deal in 2017.
