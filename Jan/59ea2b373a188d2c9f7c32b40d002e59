Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State, on Monday, inaugurated 774,000 Federal Government Extended Special Public Works Programme. Oyetola inaugurated the programme in the state capital of Osogbo. Speaking, the governor said the public works initiative was in line with Osun’s Development Agenda. Represented by his deputy, Benedict Alabi, the governor said the problem was targeted at guaranteeing and securing a better future for the youths in the state, NAN reports. The governor insisted that the programme was an indication of President Muhammadu Buhari’s readiness to empower Nigerian youths economically. “This programme, through a short-term response to the rising spate of unemployment in our country, deserves to be commended for its ambitious coverage and transparent recruitment process. “With 1,000 beneficiaries drawn from each of the 774 local governments in the country, this programme further mobilises our young people to contribute to societal development. “This will earn a modest income within the space of three months, in the first instance. “Again, this programme communicates the readiness of President Muhammadu Buhari to address the urgent need to provide economic empowerment for our teeming youth population”, he said. Recall that Buhari had last week revealed approved the commencement of the Special Public Works Programme which would engage 774,000 unemployed Nigerians.
