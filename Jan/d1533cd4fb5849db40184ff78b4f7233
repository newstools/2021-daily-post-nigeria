Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has avoided a lengthy ban after collecting the first red card of his career. Messi has now been suspended for only two games, following his Supercopa final dismissal against Athletic Club. The RFEF, who control disciplinary matters in Spain, ruled that the six-time Ballon d’Or winner will not have to serve a lengthy suspension for lashing out at Asier Villalibre. It had been suggested that Messi could face up to a 12-game ban as a result of his reckless actions. The match officials and RFEF have, however, decided that there was no aggression on the part of Messi, meaning that standard sentences will be implemented. As a result, Messi will now miss games against Cornella in the Copa del Rey and Elche in La Liga. The 33-year-old’s next outing for the Blaugrana will incidentally come against Athletic.
