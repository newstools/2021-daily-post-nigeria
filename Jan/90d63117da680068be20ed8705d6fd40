Rev. Fr. Benjamin Achi says Bishop Hassan Kukah is being attacked for his comments on President Muhammadu Buhari because he is a Christian leader. Kukah had accused the Nigerian leader of nepotism, adding that if a non-Northern Muslim acted like Buhari, there could have been a coup or war. Achi, the Communications Director, Enugu Catholic Diocese, said those castigating him were yet to point out the lies in Kukah’s Christmas homily. He advised religious leaders not to be afraid but factual in criticising the government and officials. Achi presented his position Thursday in Enugu while reacting to the quit notice the Muslim Solidarity Forum issued to Kukah to leave Sokoto. The priest wondered why the Muslim group resorted to threat when all Kukah said about the state of the nation were facts. “Those who have been crying foul about his message have not been able to say, ‘you said this and this and they are not true’. Their problem is why this person should be speaking from his own position because he is a Christian leader. “But we are not talking about religion here. We are talking about good governance. We are talking about representing the goals, the aspirations and the interests of the people”, NAN quoted him as saying. The diocesan director reminded leaders of their obligation to be the voice of the people when things are not going well. Achi insisted that Kukah had the constitutional right to air his opinion on matters affecting the people. The cleric added that for many years, the Bishop has consistently commented on issues of public interest.
