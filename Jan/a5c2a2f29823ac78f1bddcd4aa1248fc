Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, has mocked President Muhammadu Buhari over an incident with pigeons during the Armed Forces Remembrance Day ceremony on Friday. As a sign of peace, the president usually releases some white pigeons from a cage and immediately they fly away. But, this year, the birds refused flying on Friday with most of them sticking to the cage. The incident was greeted with mixed reactions with many Nigerians, attributing the birds’ behaviour to bad luck and the absence of peace and unity in the country. Reacting to the incident, Fani-Kayode, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, described the incident as bad luck. Sharing a video of the incident, the former minister wrote on his Twitter handle: “When the white doves of peace refuse to fly and when the white pigeons of the Villa fail to leave their cage it is an ominous sign and a bad omen. “Buhari beware the ides of March. “Even the pigeons refused to fly! What type of bad luck does this man have?”
