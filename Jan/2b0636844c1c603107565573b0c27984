Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has insisted that his team is ‘disappointed’ ahead of their Carabao Cup semi-final tie with Manchester City on Wednesday night because striker, Edinson Cavani, would not take part in the clash. Cavani is currently serving the second part of his three-game suspension. The Uruguay international was handed the suspension and a £100,000 fine after the FA adjudged that a post containing the words “Gracias negrito” brought the game into disrepute. The 33-year-old will also miss Man United’s Emirates FA Cup third-round clash with Watford. “We are disappointed not having Edinson [Cavani] involved [in the Man City clash],” Solskjaer said at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday. “But he is probably the only one not [available] and, of course, Phil Jones has been out for a long time. “They are the only two not available for selection, which is a good position to be in.”
