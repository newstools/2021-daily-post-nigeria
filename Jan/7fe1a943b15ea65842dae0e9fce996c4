Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, might not have Eric Bailly available for their trip to Arsenal on Saturday. Bailly picked up a knock in training before the midweek defeat by Sheffield United. Solskjaer is also monitoring Victor Lindelof, who is dealing with a stubborn back problem. Lindelof was again rested on Wednesday after playing against Liverpool on Sunday. Solskjaer started with a centre-back partnership of Harry Maguire and Axel Tuanzebe against the Blades and might do so again against Arsenal, depending on the fitness of Victor and Eric. Luke Shaw was also rested for the game on Wednesday, with Alex Telles playing at left-back instead. Fred has not started either of the Red Devilsâ€™ last two matches and might return to face Arsenal, as could Scott McTominay, who was an unused substitute, with Ole starting Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba in the centre of the park. Edinson Cavani could be in line for a recall in the capital. Long-term absentee Phil Jones is still unavailable, but Brandon Williams is an option in defence again after a recent knock.
