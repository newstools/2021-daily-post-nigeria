Big Brother Naija former housemate, Nengi, has reacted to Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri’s decision to replace her with Ebizi Blessing Eradiri as the Face of Bayelsa Girl Child. Governor Diri removed the Big Brother Naija star and replaced her with Eradiri, the first female First Class graduate from the Faculty of Law at the Niger Delta University, NDU. Eradiri also finished First Class from the Nigerian Law School. The decision of the Governor to pick Nengi for the position had met strong criticism on social media as many believed that the double First Class Law Graduate, not only made Bayelsans proud but also the entire Izon nation. And the Governor on Monday announced Eradiri as the New Face of Bayelsa Girl Child. Eradiri and her father were at the Government House, Yenagoa, where the Governor also, among other things, gave her automatic employment to lecture at the NDU’s Faculty of Law. Reacting to the development, Nengi tweeted, “Congratulations to Barr. Ebizi Eradiri. It’s amazing how you were able to pull that thru! “Special thanks to my Governor for also finding her worthy for the honour. It is without doubt that we will both work together to see how we can front for a better welfare for the Girl child.”
