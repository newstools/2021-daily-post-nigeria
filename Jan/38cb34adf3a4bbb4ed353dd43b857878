Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has urged Prof. George Obiozor, the newly-elected President-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, to improve upon the cooperation between the group and other ethnic-social groups in the country. Atiku, in a statement signed by him on Tuesday in Abuja, felicitated with Obiozor, advising him to ensure that the unity of the country was stronger and that peace reigns across Nigeria. He also expressed optimism in Obiozor’s inter-personal skills and enough group dynamics experience for the job and to weather the storm. Atiku said, “I’ve known Obiozor since his days as Director-General of Nigeria Institute of International Affairs, and a one-time Ambassador of Nigeria to the United States of America, Israel and Cyprus. “I can attest to his brilliance, wisdom and experience, qualities that I’m confident will come to bear as he pilots the affairs of Ohanaeze Ndigbo. “I also take note of the “big shoes” left behind by Obiozor’s predecessor, Chief Nnia Nwodo, who elevated Ohanaeze Ndigbo to enviable heights such that he was appointed as the Coordinator of all the notable socio-cultural groups in the country. “I know that Obiozor will tap into his experience.” Atiku also prayed for God to grant Obiozor the needed wisdom, protection, strong character, strength, candour, maturity boldness, capacity and good health for the assignment.
