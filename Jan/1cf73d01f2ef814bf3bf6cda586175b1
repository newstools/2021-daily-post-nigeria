Former Manchester United star, Gary Neville, has named midfielder, Paul Pogba, as his Man of the Match following the Red Devils’ Premier League 1-0 win over Burnley on Tuesday night. Neville believes Pogba was ‘the best player on the pitch’ during Man United’s victory against Burnley. Pogba was impressive for Man United against Burnley at Turf Moor. His fine volley gave Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men all three points against the host. “He’s been good tonight, a big influence in this second half,” Neville said of Pogba during commentary for Sky Sports. “Definitely Paul Pogba [is my man of the match], it hasn’t just been the goal in the second half. “I just think his passing in the second half, even his defensive work has been really disciplined. “He’s been good in his own box, he’s been good getting back in front of [Ashley] Barnes and [Chris] Wood, challenging for those headers to let [Harry] Maguire and [Eric] Bailly drop off. “He’s done a lot of things very well. He was the best player on the pitch for 20 minutes after half time.” Pogba will now hope to continue his impressive display for Man United when they take on Liverpool in their next Premier League fixture this weekend at Anfield.
