Fifteen (15) passengers lost their lives on Friday as two buses burst into flames after they collided along the Maiduguri, Damaturu road. The vehicles were said to be on top speed according to an eyewitness, in order to pass the dangerous points where Boko Haram militants often came out to attack travellers. Confirming the incident, the Borno Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Mr Sanusi Ibrahim, said the accident occurred near Mainok village in Kaga Local Government Area of Borno state. “I just got the report from our unit in Beneshiek that two buses carrying 15 passengers, including the drivers were involved in a fatal collision and that all the 15 people in the two buses died,” Ibrahim said. According to the FRSC, eight of the victims were female, while the rest were male. “All the corpses were taken to the General Hospital, Beneshiek, headquarters of Kaga local government. “The driver of the bus lost control because of a burst tyre leading to the collision.” He said He charged motorists to always observe the speed limit and other road safety regulations to minimise such fatal accidents. Drivers, who also commented on the accident told newsmen in Maiduguri that unless proper security measures were put in place along the Maiduguri- Damaturu road, drivers would keep speeding. “The road is also in a bad shape!” Alhaji Sani, a driver said.” “We have been trying to avoid coming into town late because of the happenings on this road. It is a daily occurrence,” he said.
