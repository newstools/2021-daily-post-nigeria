Former Governor of Kaduna State, Alhaji Mohammed Makarfi, has argued that ultimatum and counter ultimatum to Nigerians living in various parts of Nigeria wasn’t the solution to the insecurity challenges bedevilling the country. He explained that Nigerians possess the right to raise their voices against criminality perpetrated by anybody or group. Makarfi, who served two-term at the red chamber as a senator, said this in a statement entitled: “Tackling the current security challenges and the need for caution,” on Tuesday. The statement read in part, “Governments at all levels must therefore lead the quest for us to get out of this quagmire by upping the ante and tempo of this fight against insecurity in all its ramifications. “We must also realise that we’ve a part to play to ease the burden on the governments and this we can all do by coming together, setting aside all differences, be they political, religious, tribal, geographical and any other, to launch a massive onslaught on this monster, which doesn’t discriminate on who, where and when it attacks. “Leaders, political, religious, traditional, socio-cultural and others must also be smart and guard their utterances and actions, as the handling of some of the issues arising from some of the problems requires sensitivity, delicate balancing as well as the capacity to operate above the fray.” Markafi also condoled with families who lost dear ones to the various crises and criminalities occurring from this situation of insecurity in the country and also called on everyone to support governments at all levels in the fight against insecurity.
