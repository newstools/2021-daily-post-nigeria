The Nigeria Electricity Regulation Commission (NERC) has denied claims that there has been a new electricity tariff hike of 50%. NERC, in a statement released via its official Twitter account on Tuesday, said that no approval has been granted for a 50% tariff increase for electricity distribution companies, which took effect on January 1, 2021. The commission also directed customers that have been affected by any rate increases beyond the above provision of the tariff Order to report to the Commission at customer.complaints@nerc.gov.ng “The attention of the Commission has been drawn to publications in the print and electronic media misinforming electricity consumers that the Commission has approved a 50% increase in electricity tariffs. “The Commission hereby state that NO approval has been granted for a 50% tariff increase in the electricity distribution companies which took effect on January 1, 2021. “However, the tariff for customers on service bands D & E (customers that are being served less than an average of 12hrs of supply per day over a period of one month) remains frozen in line with the policy direction of the FG. “In compliance with the provisions of the EPSR act, the rates for service bands A, B, C, D and E have been adjusted by NGN2.00 to NGN4.00 per kWhr. “Also, the media is hereby requested to retract their earlier publications misinforming electricity consumers about a purported 50% increase in electricity tariffs. “Any customer that has been impacted by any rate increases beyond the above provision of the tariff Order should report to the Commission at customer.complaints@nerc.gov.ng,” the statement said.
