AC Milan’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Inter Milan’s Romelu Lukaku have avoided extra suspensions following their tussle in the Milan derby Italian Cup quarter-final last week, an Italian sports court said on Friday. Both Ibrahimovic and Lukaku have each received a one-game ban. Ibrahimovic was dismissed for a second yellow card after the head-to-head confrontation with Lukaku, who was also booked. As Lukaku had already been booked in the competition, he will miss Tuesday’s semi-final with Juventus through an accumulation of cards. Inter Milan had progressed 2-1 from the fiery last-eight clash with their city rivals. Ibrahimovic received the standard ban for a red card which will apply for the next Italian Cup match he could play. The Swedish striker also denied racism played a part in the incident, tweeting: “In Zlatan’s world there is no place for racism.”
