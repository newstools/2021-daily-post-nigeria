The US Senate has finally reached a decision on the commencement of impeachment trial of ex-President, Donald Trump. The opening arguments in the Senate impeachment trial will begin on February 8, 2021. Trump will not just be the first President to be impeached twice in recent American history, but also the first US former president to face trial after leaving office. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced the schedule for Trump’s impeachment trial Friday evening after reaching an agreement with Republicans, AP reports. Some Republicans had pushed for a delay to allow Trump who just departed the White House on Wednesday the chance to organize his legal team and prepare a defense on the sole charge of incitement of insurrection. “We all want to put this awful chapter in our nation’s history behind us,” Schumer said about the deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6 by Trump supporters. “But healing and unity will only come if there is truth and accountability. And that is what this trial will provide.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the article of impeachment late Monday, with senators sworn in as jurors Tuesday. But opening arguments will move to February. The House of Representatives impeached President Trump two weeks ago for inciting the mob in what was seen as his final push to stop the certification of the victory of the then President-elect, Joe Biden by the Congress.
