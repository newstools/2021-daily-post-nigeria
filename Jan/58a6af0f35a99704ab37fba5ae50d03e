Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has insisted the club will not do business this January, because his squad is already “full of quality”. After guiding United to a third-place finish in the Premier League last season, Solskjaer brought in Donny van de Beek, Alex Telles, Edinson Cavani and Facundo Pellistri. An agreement was also reached with Atalanta for the transfer of Amad Diallo, who finally completed his £37 million move to Old Trafford at the start of this month. United have risen to second in the Premier League after 19 fixtures and look set to fight for their first title in eight years, but it has still been suggested by some fans and experts that the team is still one or two players short of being the finished article. When asked about the possibility of signing any new players this month, the Norwegian head coach told a press conference ahead of tonight’s game against Sheffield: “I wouldn’t think so, no. I’d be surprised if we do any incomings. “The squad is strong, it’s full of quality. I still need to leave players out for the squad at times. “Bar something surprising happening, I wouldn’t think something will happen [in terms of] incomings, no.”
