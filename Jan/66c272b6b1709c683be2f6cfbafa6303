Local government chairmen and councillor’s in Rivers State, elected under former Governor Rotimi Amaechi in 2015 have warned against the conduct of local government elections in the state as announced by the Rivers State Independent Electoral Commission. The removed chairmen and councillor’s said there is a pending matter before the Appeal Court over their removal, stressing that any attempt to conduct the local government election will amount to contempt of court. This comes a week after the faction of the APC led by Senator Magnus Abe declared preparedness for the forthcoming council elections. Factional Chairman of the group, Golden Ben-Chioma, who took over mantle of leadership from Igo Aguma, said the party was ready to impact politically in the state, having suffered backwardness for years due to leadership crisis. But speaking on behalf of the group in a media briefing in Port Harcourt, Sogbeye Eli, who was elected Chairman of Degema Local Government Council in 2015 cautioned the current RISIEC Chairman, retired Justice George Omereji to be aware of the implications of going ahead with the local government election. Eli while announcing that the APC will not participate in any local government elections, called for the arrest and prosecution of any person or group of persons that attempt to participate in the polls using the name of the APC. “We are calling on the National Caretaker Committee of APC to issue official letter immediately, directing the official boycott of Rivers APC due to the pendency of the local government election matter at the Appeal Court. “The National Caretaker Committee headed by H.E. Buni, should sanction any APC leader in any LGA clamouring for participation of APC in this illegal council polls. “Out of abundance of caution, we call on the new political leadership of RSIEC under Justice Omereji, to beware of the consequences of contempt of court,” he said.
