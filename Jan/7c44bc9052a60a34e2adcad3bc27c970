Chelsea winger, Christian Pulisic, has identified Fikayo Tomori and Timo Werner as the two fastest players at Stamford Bridge. Pulisic also named Olivier Giroud as the best finisher at Chelsea. The USA international disclosed this ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash with Manchester City on Sunday. Asked which Chelsea player would win a 100m race, Pulisic told Sky Sports, “That is a good question. “I think I would definitely put myself in the top-five, not number one, probably not number two, but top five. “I know Fikayo [Tomori] is fast, Timo [Werner] is fast. There’s a lot of fast guys in the team.” Asked to name best finisher at Chelsea, Pulisic added, “I would have to go with Olivier Giroud. [He’s a] lethal finisher, especially with first-time shots or volleys. “He just always gets a clean contact on the ball. He’s really strong in front of goal.”
