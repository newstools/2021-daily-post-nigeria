Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, will have Gabriel Martinelli and Kieran Tierney available for Monday night’s Premier League game with Newcastle. Tierney was left out of their 0-0 draw with Crystal Palace last week after sustaining a muscle injury. Martinelli also missed the game, after suffering a fresh setback shortly after returning to action following his recovery from knee surgery in December. The Brazilian forward hurt his ankle during Arsenal’s FA Cup third-round victory over Newcastle and also missed the Palace clash. “Gabi is now back in full training and is available for selection,” a statement on the club’s official website reads. “Kieran has recovered from his tight calf and is back in training with the squad. Kieran will be assessed and tested ahead of Monday’s match.” The club also confirmed that Pablo Mari is still sidelined with a calf strain, meaning David Luiz and Rob Holding will likely continue to marshal the defence when Newcastle arrive at Emirates Stadium.
