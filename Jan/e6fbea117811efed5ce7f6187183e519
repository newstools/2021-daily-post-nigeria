President Muhammadu Buhari has showered praises on Bisi Akande, the pioneer Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, as he turns 82 years old. Buhari, in a copy of the birthday best wishes made available to DAILY POST by his Spokesman, Garba Shehu, described the former Osun State Governor as “one of the biggest and strongest pillars of democracy in the country.” Buhari also noted in the message, that Akande “is committed to service of the country and welfare of all citizens.” The President specifically pointed out that the APC, which Akande helped establish in 2014 has benefited from his wealth of experience and leadership qualities and “strong democratic convictions.” The President prayed that God will continues to keep Akande in good health and grant him longer life “so that the elder statesman will continue to be useful to his fatherland and humanity.”
