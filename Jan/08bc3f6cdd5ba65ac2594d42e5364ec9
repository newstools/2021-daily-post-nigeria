Former Liverpool player, Mark Lawrenson, has predicted Chelsea to beat Leicester City 2-0 at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday night. Chelsea were 1-0 winners against Fulham last Saturday, while Leicester defeated Southampton 2-0. Frank Lampard’s side is in the 7th position on the Premier League table with 29 points from 18 games, while Leicester is in the 3rd position with 35 points from the same number of games. “Leicester will go back to the top of the table for the first time since 20 Nov. If they beat Chelsea, and they played very well when they beat Southampton at the weekend,” Lawrenson told BBC Sport. “I just have a feeling the Foxes might slip up this time, though. Their home form is generally not that great, and they have a fitness doubt over Jamie Vardy too. “Chelsea are hardly flying either, mind you. They got a much-needed win over Fulham on Saturday, but it wasn’t exactly convincing. “Having watched them, I’m not so sure, but I do fancy them here. Weaker teams than them, like West Ham, Aston Villa and Fulham, have all gone to King Power Stadium and won in the league this season, and I am backing Chelsea to do the same. Leicester 0, Chelsea 2.” The kick-off time for Leicester vs Chelsea is 9:15 pm.
