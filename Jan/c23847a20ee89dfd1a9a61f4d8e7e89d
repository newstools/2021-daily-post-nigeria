The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has urged Nigerians to ignore all rumours of recruitment and letters of employment/recruitment purportedly emanating from the commission. Mr Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education, made this known in statement on Friday in Abuja. Okoye said that INEC was not recruiting at this time, adding that recruitment of fresh graduates and experienced professionals had since been suspended. “INEC wishes to once again draw the attention of members of the public to the activities of fake employment merchants and racketeers. “The racketeers open fake employment websites, collect money from unsuspecting members of the public and issue fake employment letters purporting to be acting on behalf of the Commission. Okoye said that the Commission was a public trust that always conducted its activities in the best tradition of openness and transparency. He added that with its policy of transparency, the Commission make it known publicly its recruitment process. Okoye appealed to the public to be more conscious of the antics of fraudsters and not to fall victim to their criminal activities.
