President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday restated the commitment of the Nigerian government on security, economy and anti-corruption. The President added that his administration would continue to ensure the enthronement of democracy and good governance on the African continent. Buhari spoke at the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Committee of Heads of State and Government in the African Peer Review Mechanism (APR Forum) and Nigeria on the ongoing Second Peer Review Process. “We remain fully committed to promoting the good governance practice enshrined in the ideals and vision of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development which gave birth to this review mechanism”, the President said. He recalled that Nigeria had, since the first Peer Review in 2008, covered appreciable ground in the implementation of the National Programme of Action. “Our Administration has continued to vigorously pursue Security, Economic Diversification and Anti-Corruption as the main thrust of the national change agenda. “The totality of this strategy is premised on the promotion of democracy, respect for the Rule of Law and Human Rights, gender equality and by far the largest investment in social change in Nigeria’s post-independence history.” He expressed the readiness of the federal government to submit to the review exercise. Buhari said Nigeria is keen to join the league of African Union Member States which will undergo the second peer review exercise. This, he noted, was a firm demonstration of the belief in the dividends of democracy through the system. Buhari added that Nigeria must stay the course and continue on the pathway to a peaceful, secure and more democratic country.
