The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lagos, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, has shared some details of this year’s post-UTME examinations. According to Ogundipe, the university is getting set for a non-physical post-UTME test. Speaking with NAN, he confirmed that the exams will be conducted from 15th to 23rd of February, 2021. Ogundipe also noted that candidates would need tablets not just for the post-UTME test but also to facilitate other e-learning processes. He disclosed that over 50,000 candidates applied for admission in the 2020/2021 academic session, out of which about 22,000 scored 200 marks and above. According to him, 21,955 candidates have so far paid to write the post-UTME test. Ogundipe added that: “We looked at the issue of indigent candidates; we then decided to see how we can carry them along. “Right now, we have started talking to some friends of the university and alumni to see how we can get tablets that we can give them.”
