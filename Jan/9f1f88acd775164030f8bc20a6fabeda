Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, the immediate past Chief of Army Staff, COAS, has said ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo almost retired him 21 years ago. Buratai said Obasanjo almost retired him at the rank of a Major. He disclosed this while handing over to Major General Ibrahim Attahiru who replaced him as the new COAS at the Army Headquarters in Abuja. The former COAS, however, described his attainment of the rank of Lieutenant General and Chief of Army Staff as historic. Buratai commended troops serving home and abroad, stressing that the Nigerian Army will never remain the same. According to Buratai: “Former President Olusegun Obasanjo almost retired me 21 years ago when I was a Major. My retirement after 40 years of service is historic, hence, calls for gratitude”. Buratai alongside his colleagues as Service Chiefs had resigned. Following their action, President Muhammadu Buhari had immediately appointed replacements of the outgoing Service Chiefs. Major-General LEO Irabor, Chief of Defence Staff; Major-General I. Attahiru, Chief of Army Staff; Rear Admiral AZ Gambo, Chief of Naval Staff and Air Vice-Marshal IO Amao, Chief of Air Staff.
