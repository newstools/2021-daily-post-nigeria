The Federal Government has finally decided to go ahead with the January 18, 2021 resumption date for schools nationwide. This is despite the pressure being mounted by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and other stakeholders that school shout remain shut amid the second wave of the pandemic. On Monday, the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, during the press briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 on Monday said the January 18 resumption date was not sacrosanct. However, in a statement signed by the Director, Press and Public Relations, Bem Goong, Adamu explained that the decision to maintain the resumption date was the aftermath of “extensive consultations with relevant stakeholders, including state governors, commissioners of education, proprietors and heads of institutions, staff unions and students”, respectively. The Minister, however, urged parents and respective institutions to ensure full compliance with COVID-19 protocols. The statement read in full: “Sequel to the hint given during the press briefing on 12 January 2021 for the review of the proposed resumption date of 18th January 2021, the Federal Ministry of Education has undertaken a comprehensive appraisal of the situation. “After extensive consultations with relevant stakeholders, including State Governors, Commissioners of Education, Proprietors and heads of institutions, staff unions and students, the consensus of opinion is that the resumption date of 18th January should remain, while parents and respective institutions must ensure full compliance with COVID-19 protocols including:- (i) Compulsory wearing of Facemasks by all students, teachers and workers in all schools (ii) Temperature checks and hand washing facilities at strategic locations in all schools (iii) Ensuring constant supply of water and sanitizers (iv) Enforcement of maintenance of social distancing and suspension of large gatherings such as assembly and visiting days.
