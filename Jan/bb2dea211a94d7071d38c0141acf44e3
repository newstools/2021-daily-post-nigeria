There was palpable tension in Ebrumede Community in Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State as Policemen from the Divisional Headquarters, chasing suspected internet fraudsters along the DSC expressway on Wednesday crushed a commercial tricycle conveying a mother and her baby to death. The tricycle operator and other passengers also sustained serious injuries. An angry mob promptly set a police Hilux patrol van ablaze. The latest killing is coming four months after the End SARS protests across Nigeria. When contacted for comments, the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya in a telephone chat with Correspondent could not confirm if it was policemen who actually caused the death of the woman and her baby. She said,”I am talking with them. They’re still trying to find out what happened. So, we want to know what really happened.” The Warri Area Commander of the Nigeria Police Force, ACP Mohammed Argungun in a telephone chat said, “Am on the way to Ebrumede to ascertain what actually happened. For now, I am not in a position to tell you what the situation is on the ground. Whatever the situation is, we will pass a message across and the Command and PPRO will be the one to talk to you.” A human right activist, Comrade Israel Joe in a chat with Our Correspondent said, “It was too early for the police to start engaging in certain activities that led us into the recent End SARS protest across Nigeria and the world. “It is a pity and an innocent woman and her child has lost their lives to the activities of incompetence and insecurity. While noting that the state government has promised to create a security and human rights committee in addition to the present Judicial Panel of Inquiry, he said “We believe such a committee would take care of these issues, bring those involved to book and compensate victims of police and military brutality. “We are right now assessing the situation and if something tangible is not done another protest looms.”
