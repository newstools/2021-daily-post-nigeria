President Donald Trump will leave Washington DC on Wednesday morning before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in, according to Washington Post. The newspaper quoted a senior administration official to have revealed the outgoing President’s plan. Trump had previously announced he would not be at the inauguration of his successor at the U.S. Capitol. Trump not being at Biden’s swearing-in shatters a long lasting tradition in the US. Biden had described the Trump administration as a “dismal failure” while seeking to keep a focus on combating the coronavirus. Biden, who won the November 3 presidential election with over 300 electoral votes will be sworn in on January 20, 2021.
