Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has criticised referee Peter Bankes for making two mistakes, after they lost 2-1 to Sheffield United on Wednesday night. Solskjaer was furious after the referee allowed Kean Bryan’s opening goal to stand, despite Billy Sharp’s interference with David de Gea and ruling out an effort by Anthony Martial minutes later. He told BT Sport: “It’s a foul. Billy Sharp just runs into him (De Gea) so he can’t get up, so it’s a foul.” When asked about Martial’s disallowed effort, Solskjaer said: “No foul… but it’s this kind of season, inconsistencies, so it’s going to be unpredictable. But it’s two mistakes by the referee.” The result means United missed the chance to leapfrog Manchester City back into top spot. Solskjaer’s men froze under the pressure against Blades, who had only won once in the Premier League this season and came into the game with five points.
