The Commandant of Oyo State Security Network Agency also known as Amotekun Corps, Olayinka Olayanju, has raised the alarm that some aides of the state governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde are asking him to release some suspected criminals. Olayanju, a retired Colonel, made this disclosure while speaking in Ibadan, the State capital. Our correspondent gathered that Amotekun Corps, a new security outfit set up by Governors in the South West Nigeria started its operation last year in the state. Amotekun Corps according to Olayanju has arrested some suspected criminals in the last few weeks. But, the Commandant has however explained that some aides of the governor are indirectly backing hoodlums terrorising the people of the state. Olayanju made this declaration
while speaking on Tuesday at abFresh FM radio Ibadan program monitored by DAILY POST. Olayanju while speaking on the radio program, insisted that some senior aides of the governor have pleaded that the agency should free suspected hoodlums arrested in connection with civil disturbances in some parts of Ibadan. The commandant however did not mention the names of those who approached him to release the suspects. Olayanju said, “Some people would come to plead that we should release those arrested. “We arrested some in Ibadan North-East less than a week ago and one SA, Special Adviser was running around begging us. “He came and met me around NTA and I told him that we have handed them over to the police at Yemetu. “I won’t mention the name. He is SA to the governor, some are chairmen, some are lawmakers who seek such a favour.”
