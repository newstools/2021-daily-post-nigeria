Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has admitted that Donny van de Beek is unhappy at the club. Van de Beek has made only nine starts since arriving at Old Trafford in a £35million deal from Ajax in the summer with just two of them in the Premier League. But Solskjaer believes the 23-year-old midfielder reminds him of when he became a Super Sub under Sir Alex Ferguson. Solskjaer said: “I wouldn’t say that Donny is happy. Of course, he wants to play more, but he gets about his job in the right manner. “He reminds me a lot about myself, when I first came in, that he understands my difficulties and challenges. Solskjaer however confirmed that Van de Beek will be involved, when they take on Liverpool in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday. “He knows he is important for us and knows he is going to play many games. “He will definitely be involved in this game against Liverpool and he might be the deciding factor in the game,” he added.
