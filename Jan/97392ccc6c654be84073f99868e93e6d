Akin-Olugbade was a Rolls Royce lover and one of the largest collectors worldwide. His 10th Rolls Royce, the Cullinan worth $450,000, was reportedly the first shipped to Africa in 2019. A man of taste and glamour, Akin-Olugbade told ThisDay in 2018: “I have different concepts of how I spend money. “I spend money on cars because I have always loved cars. I bought my first Rolls Royce in 1984 and now, I am on my ninth Rolls Royce. I believe in dressing well and I travel a lot.” Ginimbi dies in crash hours after flaunting Rolls Royce [VIDEO] Lagos Commissioner for Health, Akin Abayomi recovers from COVID-19, tests negative Rep member, Akin Alabi reveals why Nigerian artisans are not getting patronage
