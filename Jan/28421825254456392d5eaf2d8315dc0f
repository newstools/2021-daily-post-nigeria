The National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Yobe Command said it intercepted 2.3 tonnes of Cannabis Sativa from January 2020 to date. Mr. Apeh Reuben, the State Commander of the Agency on Friday made this known while briefing newsmen on the Command’s activities during the year under review. Reuben said the Command succeeded in arresting 112 drug offenders out of which four were females. He said that the Command had so far seized a total of 3,422 kg of Cannabis Sativa and Psychotropic Substances. According to him, the Command also prosecuted 25 cases and counselled 27 other cases. He said the anti-narcotics agency had embarked on public enlightenment on the dangers of drug abuse and trafficking in the state. “The agency had through its drug demand reduction activities carried out a series of campaigns in English and other local languages like Hausa and Kanuri across the state”. Reuben, therefore, called on the public to support the agency with timely information on the movement of substances that may cause confusion and breach of peace in the society. He also commended the state government for its support to the command and appealed for more support, especially on logistics.
