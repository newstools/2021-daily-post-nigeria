The Chelsea hierarchy has informed manager Frank Lampard, that he is expected to reach the top four this season if he intends to still be in charge of the team, the UK Mirror reports. Senior officials at Stamford Bridge want to give under-pressure Lampard time to turn the club’s fortunes around and not make a decision mid-season. However, they are believed to be considering Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, RB Leipzigs Julian Nagelsmann and Thomas Tuchel who was just sacked at Paris Saint-Germain. Ex-Juventus boss Max Allegri has also admitted he wants to manage in England. Chelsea may be seen moving towards a German or German speaker if they replace Lampard, because of the makeup of the dressing room with the likes of Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and Antonio Rudiger among prominent squad members. But Lampard is likely to be judged on whether he can get Chelsea back into the Champions League next season. Having spent £200m last summer, the hierarchy believes the Blues should be in the top four and among the contenders.
