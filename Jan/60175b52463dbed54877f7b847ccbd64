Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) has advised Nigerians to accept the seriousness of the COVID-19 second wave. Prof. Adetokunbo Fabamwo, Medical Director (CMD) LASUTH, in a statement on Saturday, appealed to citizens to comply with safety measures. Fabamwo expressed concern over the recent daily infection numbers. He said the positivity rate rose from an average of about eight percent in November 2020 to an average of 28 percent. “The disease is affecting both the young and the elderly, some affected people may experience a long-term sequel. People are dying from this disease and it is imperative that we accept the seriousness.” The medical expert regretted that Nigerians were downplaying their personal risk and the risk to their loved ones. He stressed the importance of proper wearing of facemask when interacting with others, regular hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. The CMD further advised against self-medication. “See a health practitioner if you experience ill-health. Do not keep treating malaria multiple times, it might be COVID-19 and you should get tested,” Fabamwo urged.
