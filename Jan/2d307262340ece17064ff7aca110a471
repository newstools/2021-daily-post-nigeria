Ayodele Fayose, former Governor of Ekiti State, has said Nigerians would remember President Muhammadu Buhari like Americans will recall the distasteful administration of the outgoing President of the United States, US, Donald Trump. Fayose made the remark while describing Buhari as a “low budget Trump.” Trump’s tenure would expire in the next few hours as the US President-Elect, Joe Biden would be inaugurated. However, Fayose said Nigerians can’t wait to see the end of Buhari’s regime just as Americans look forward to Trump’s exit. In a series of tweets, the former governor wrote: “As Americans look forward to the exit of Trump, Nigerians too cannot wait to see the exit of Buhari. “The two can’t be forgotten in a jiffy. Buhari will be remembered like Trump because he is the low budget Trump when compared to their countries. “Everything that matters has been destroyed under the watch of Buhari. All the values that we share as a country – economy, security, human rights, the rule of law, credible elections and unity of the country have been destroyed.”
