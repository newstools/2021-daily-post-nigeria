Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has reacted to the retirement of former teammate, Wayne Rooney, from football. Rooney hung up his boots following his appointment as Derby County new manager on Friday. The former striker was offered a two-and-half-year deal by Derby which will run until the summer of 2023. Reacting, Ferdinand described Rooney as a great person, teammate who loved playing football and can score 30 goals a season. “He [Wayne Rooney] was a difference maker,” Ferdinand told BT Sport. “He could be a Number 9 who would score 25, 30 goals a season but he could also drop in and be a Number 10 and dictate a game. “He just loved football, this kid just loved playing football. That is what it was about for him. Yes, it was about trophies and winning, but he wanted to enjoy football. “He is a great person, a great teammate throughout the years. Funny guy, loved a laugh as well but this kid knew how to put the ball in the back of the net. “What was great about him about his career – how many times have we seen young childhood superstars talked about as the next big thing who don’t quite get there? Because of the pressure that comes with that ability, they can’t back that up.”
