Former Governor of Jigawa State, Alhaji Sule Lamido said the days of the All Progressive Congress APC is numbered as President Muhammad Buhari will not support Bola Ahmad Tinubu’s candidature in the coming 2023 general. Lamido stated this at the inauguration of the Jigawa State People’s Democratic Party PDP reconciliation committee in Dutse. He claimed that in the near future, there would be no more APC because the whole of APC is made of two people Buhari and Tinubu. “True of the matter very soon there would be no APC in Nigeria because it’s made up of two persons Buhari and Tinubu” “And I swear to God Buhari will not support Tinubu’s candidacy coming 2023 general election” “So since they are the leaders of APC and they have issues everyone will find his way and that would be the end of APC in Nigeria” Lamido, however, said the break up of the APC does not mean the PDP’s victory unless the members unite. “We also have our own problems is either we correct or Nigerians would continue to suffer” “We must forget all our grievances, set aside all our personal interest for us to win because it’s only PDP that can be able to rule this country” he stated. Lamido charged the members of the reconciliation committee to be just and fair in their approach to aggrieved members. He appealed to aggrieved members to put the party before their interest, for the victory of the party.
