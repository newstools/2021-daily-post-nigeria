Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp has noted that his side lost and crashed out of the FA Cup to Manchester United on Sunday night because of some decisive mistakes committed by his players. Liverpool took the lead in the 18th minute, through Mohamed Salah but Mason Greenwood made it 1-1 for United just before the break. Then Marcus Rushford, capitalising on Rhys Williams’ mistake put United ahead and Salah fired home his second of the night to make it 2-2. But the home side were eager not to see the game go into extra time with Bruno Fernandes firing home a free kick from the edge of the box in the 78th to send United through to the next round of the competition. And the Liverpool boss feels that some of the mistakes by his boys provided the ample opportunity for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side to steal the night. “It’s not what we wanted, so it’s frustrating. If you want to win tonight, you have to play at your absolute top,” Klopp told the press after the highly entertaining game. “The start of the game was good, but then we made decisive mistakes; around the first goal United scored, we had too many options offensively and no protection. “We lost the ball and then there was a counter-attack. It was not the first counter-attack in the game, so we have to improve that.”
