Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has lambasted Nigerians asking ex-Lagos Governor, Bola Tinubu, to contest for presidency in 2023. The cleric advised them to rather allow President Muhammadu Buhari to run again. It is believed that the All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader is keen on succeeding Buhari. At a service in his church headquarters in Akure, Ondo State, Giwa noted that a Tinubu presidency would only worsen Nigeria’s governance. According to him, “better the devil you know than the devil you don’t.” He also kicked against zoning the presidency to the South, warning that such would trigger a dangerous situation that might lead to “breakup”. “Anybody asking the former governor of Lagos, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu to be the next president of Nigeria should rather support Buhari for a third term. What has Tinubu done to deserve being the next President of Nigeria? “You must be a fool if you continue to campaign for a man who has worked only for himself. When Fulani herdsmen were slaughtering farmers, where was Tinubu? When President Buhari increased electricity tariff and jerked up the price of petrol, what did Tinubu say? “He has never seen anything bad that this administration has done to Nigerians since 2015. Tinubu’s presidency will only worsen the poor leadership Nigerians are currently witnessing, and it will not do us anything positive”, Giwa stressed.
