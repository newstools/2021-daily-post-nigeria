Former Chelsea striker, Tony Cascarino has said at least three teams can win the Premier League title this season. Champions Liverpool is currently on top of the Premier League title, with goals different ahead of second-place Manchester United. But Cascarino believes Liverpool, Manchester City and Man United are the three contenders for the English top-flight league title this term. When asked who he believes will win the Premier League this season, Cascarino told The Times, “I have said all along it’s between Liverpool and the two Manchester clubs and I stick by that. “Manchester City’s defensive solidity is making them the favourites. The winning points tally might be very low.” He added, “We have seen Arsenal and Southampton stick by their manager in recent times despite poor results, and I think Manchester United were right to do the same. “You cannot expect a quick fix. Solskjaer should only be judged at the end of this season.”
