Three brothers arrested for allegedly killing security guard in Ogun Three brothers, who were identified by the police as Okiki Mulero, 23, Micheal Mulero, 21 and Joseph Mulero, 17 have been arrested for allegedly beating a So-Safe corps officer to death in Ogun State on Christmas eve. They were arrested by men of the Ogun State Police Command on December 25, 2020 over the death of the security officer, who the police said was on guard duty at the OGD Estate Asero when the incident happened. The Ogun Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST on Monday. According to him, trouble started when one of the suspects, Okiki Mulero, a commercial cyclist was denied entrance into the estate for carrying more than one passenger as against the rule of the estate. The refusal infuriated the okada rider as he called his two brothers, Michael and Joseph, who came to the scene and they jointly attacked the deceased security guard and his colleague with planks. “In the process, one of the security men named Segun Godfrey Barde was hit with a plank and he slumped. “He was subsequently rushed to O&A Hospital where he gave up the ghost on Friday 25th of December 2020 while receiving treatment, Oyeyemi informed. The police spokesman disclosed that the case was reported at Obantoko divisional headquarters by the CDA executives of the estate. Consequently, the DPO of Obantoko Abeokuta, CSP Sunday Opebiyi, had detailed his detectives to go after the suspects and they were eventually apprehended one after the other, it was said. Oyeyemi narrated that the suspects have admitted committing the crime. The case has been transferred to the homicide section of the state CIID as directed by the state Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun.
