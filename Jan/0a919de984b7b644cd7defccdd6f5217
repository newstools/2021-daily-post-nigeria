The Premier League will enforce permanent concussion substitutes from fixtures on February 6. This means clubs in the Premier League, FA Cup, Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship can permanently substitute players who are diagnosed with or suspected of sustaining a concussion during games. Both sides in each match will have two such replacements available, in addition to their three regular substitutions. The lunchtime kickoff between Aston Villa and Everton on February 6, will be the first fixture under the new regulations. The new protocol will first come into force in the FA Cup from next month’s fifth round and will be used in the Women’s Super League and Championship from February 6. “The trial is a result of the IFAB’s consultation with stakeholders and recommendations from their concussion expert group to allow additional substitutions for players with an actual or suspected concussion,” a joint statement from the FA and Premier League read.
