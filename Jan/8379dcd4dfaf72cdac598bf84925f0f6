Manchester United travel to Burnley in the Premier League on Tuesday, knowing that if they avoid defeat, they would move above rivals Liverpool on the table. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side are currently second, level on 33 points with the reigning champions. Their hosts are in 16th place, having picked up 16 points from their 15 matches. However, Burnley will go into the clash having won three of their last four matches in all competitions. Goals have been a real issue for the Clarets this campaign, as they have netted only nine times – the second-worst record behind Sheffield United. United on the other hand, have won eight of their last 10 matches. January could be a key month for Solskjaer, with clashes against Liverpool, Fulham, Sheffield United and Arsenal to come before a home game against Southampton on February 2. The Red Devils recorded a 2-0 victory at Burnley in the corresponding game last season, but the Clarets ran out 2-0 winners when the two sides last locked horns in January 2020 at Old Trafford.
