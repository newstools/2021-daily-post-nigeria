The Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, has reacted to the attack on a Fulani community in the South West. According to ACF, such an act was a social upheaval that may destabilize the country, alleging that security agents were nowhere to be found when the attack was carried out. This was contained in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary of ACF, Emmanuel Yawe, entitled “Stop the Drift in the South West.” He recalled that the civil war in the 1960’s started with attacks and counter-attacks like the Oyo attack on Fulani. He stated that, “this morning, we received reports of an attack by Yoruba Youths on Alhaji Saliu Abdulkadir, the Serki Fulani in Oyo State. “In the reports, he was attacked and driven out of his house, eleven cars and his house burnt with his family members now living in the bush. “There are allegations that one Sunday Igboho, an agitator for the Oodua Republic and who issued an ultimatum giving Fulani people seven days to leave Yorubaland is the instigator of the attack. “The most disturbing aspect of the attack is the allegation that the security agents who were earlier warned about its imminence stood by helplessly as the attack was carried out.” “The ACF is worried about this trend and calls on the Federal and State Governments in the South West to move quickly to avert a social upheaval that may destabilize the whole country. “We recall that the civil war in the 60’s started with attacks and counter-attacks like this.” A Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho, on Saturday made gool his threat to expel Fulanis from Igangan in Oyo State. Igangan is a community in Ibarapa North Local Government Area. Last Friday, Igboho and his supporters stormed the area and gave the Fulani one week to leave.
