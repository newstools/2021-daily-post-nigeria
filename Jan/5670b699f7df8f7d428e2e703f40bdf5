Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has commented on midfielder Dele Alli’s performance against Marine following his side’s FA Cup 5-0 victory on Sunday. Mourinho said he was pleased with Alli’s display against Marine, adding that the England international could feature for Spurs in their next game against Aston Villa in the Premier League on Wednesday. Tottenham defeated Marine, thanks to goals from Carlos Vinicius (3), Lucas Moura (1) and Alfie Devine (1) Speaking on Alli’s performance against Marine, Mourinho told BBC Sport: “I enjoyed his performance very much. Of course, he was cautious and like every one of us was a little bit scared of the nature of the pitch and the way they can compete. “So it was a game where the creative players could not risk a lot but between him and Gedson Fernandes they were responsible for the dynamic of the team in the first half to create chances and score goals.” Mourinho added: “I am really happy with his attitude in the game, I am happy – good professionalism, good dynamic from him. “He was here today and of course it wasn’t the match to measure the quality, but the professionalism and attitude and I’m very happy with it, I will not be surprised if next Wednesday Dele [Alli] is playing with us.” Meanwhile, Dele has been heavily linked with a move away from Tottenham in the past couple of days to reunite with his former coach, Mauricio Pochettino at PSG.
