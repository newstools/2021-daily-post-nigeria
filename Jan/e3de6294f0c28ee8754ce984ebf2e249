Ayodele Fayose, former Ekiti State Governor, has rebuked Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and culture over his remark on Nigeria’s security situation. Fayose described as “evil” Mohammed’s comparison of insecurity now and what was obtainable in 2015. Speaking yesterday, the Minister had boasted that the security situation in Nigeria had improved under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari than what it met in 2015. Faulting Mohammed’s remark, Fayose lamented that the All Progressives Congress, APC, government had failed to protect Nigerians. In a series of tweets, the former governor wrote: “As Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed has lost his moral obligation to Nigeria and its people. He is no doubt a Minister of Misinformation. He is not only a lying Mohammed, he is evil Mohammed. “At 69 years, it is a shame that he carries evil in his brain and vomit evil words through his septic-tank-like-mouth. It is a regret that at 69, that Evil Mohammed can open his mouth to defend insecurity in the country, comparing the situation now with what was obtainable in 2015. “Unfortunately, this present APC govt has failed to secure Nigerians, with Aso Rock Villa fast becoming the only secured place in the country. “Nigerians are not interested in comparing what happened before 2015 with what is happening now. Rather, they are interested in a secured country where they can carry out their daily activities without fear of being killed or kidnapped.”
