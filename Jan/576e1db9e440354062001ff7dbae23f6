Mesut Ozil is very close to moving to Fenerbahce, after the door was closed to a return to the first team at Arsenal, the UK Mirror reports. The 32-year-old was initially expected to join the Super Lig side on loan for the rest of the season. That move would have seen the Gunners paying his Â£350,000-a-week wages, before his contract expires at the end of this season, and then he would make the move permanent. However, Ozil may be free to make the move long-term this month, as Arsenal are planning on terminating his deal if an agreement can be reached. Ozil will wear the number 23 shirt, dropping the 10 he wore for the Gunners. The Turkish club are also planning a special presentation ceremony for Ozil, who could sign his new contract as early as Saturday.
