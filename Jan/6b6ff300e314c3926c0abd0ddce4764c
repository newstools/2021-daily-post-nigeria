Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted the Red Devils to beat Liverpool in Sunday’s Premier League fixture. Berbatov also predicted Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal would defeat Newcastle United at the Emirates Stadium on Monday, while Fulham will beat Chelsea on Saturday evening. Providing his predictions, Berbatov told Metro UK, “I want to see United make the most of the position they are in and increase their lead at the top to six points clear of Liverpool. “It’s going to be a tough game, and there is a lot at stake. I think it will be a tactical battle, but I don’t care how they do it, I just want to see United win, and I think they will continue to surprise people. Liverpool 1, Man United 2.” Commenting on the Arsenal vs Newcastle game, Berbatov said, “Arsenal v Newcastle Arsenal have turned a corner, and they are looking a lot better recently. “Although they needed extra time against Newcastle in the cup last weekend, I think they will get the job done in 90 minutes in this one. They are playing catch up, and they can’t afford any more slips. Arsenal 2, Newcastle 0.” On the Fulham vs Chelsea match, Berbatov said, “What is going on at Chelsea? If they lose this one, I think Frank Lampard will definitely be in trouble. They have a lot of new players that aren’t producing as people expect them to, this along with bad luck results in where they are at the moment, I think it’s a momentum thing, and once they break out of it, they will be fine. “That being said, I think it’s a good opportunity for Fulham and I can see them putting even more pressure on Chelsea, so I’m going for a surprise. Fulham 1, Chelsea 0.”
