The National Working Committee of the All Progressive Grand Alliance, APGA, has counselled the new President General of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo to use his wealth of experience as an Ambassador to bring ndigbo together as a way of further integrating them into the mainstream of the Nigerian society. APGA further charged the new leadership of Ohanaeze to build on the legacy his predecessor since the central objective is to reengineer the machinery for the overall attainment of the collective goals of the association. The APGA NWC gave the admonition in a statement signed by the National Chairman, Ozonkpu Victor Ike Oye and made available to DAILY POST by the spokesman, Barrister Tex Okechukwu, on Monday. The party leadership posited that with the election of Prof. Obiozor, the frontline Igbo socio-political group had been put on auto-drive because of the enormous experience he garnered over the years, assuring that APGA would give him maximum support. On the wranglings trailing the emergence of Professor George Obiozor as the new President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, APGA expressed satisfaction that the election was free and fair as was corroborated by other contestants. The partyâ€™s NWC congratulated Professor Obiozor on his victory as the President of Ohaneze Ndigbo after a keenly contested election, praying God to give the new Ohanaeze Ndigbo President General the required wisdom, courage and good health to face the challenges of his new office. DAILY POST reports that Ambassador George Obiozor was elected after polling the highest votes. Obiozor won the contest with a total of 304 votes. His emergence follows the tenure expiration of the Chief Nnia Nwodo-led executive of Ohanaeze Ndigbo.
