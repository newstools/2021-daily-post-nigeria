Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has claimed he does not listen to the speculation over his future. However, he admits he’s aware of the pressure that comes with being Blues boss. Lampard’s position is under scrutiny following their 2-0 defeat at Leicester City on Tuesday, a result which leaves them eighth in the Premier League. The Blues have won just three of their last 10 matches in all competitions, leading to reports that the club could be interested in RB Leipzig’s Julian Nagelsmann should Lampard’s position become untenable. Out-of-work managers Massimiliano Allegri and Thomas Tuchel are understood to be interested in the Chelsea job if it becomes available. But when asked about the speculation ahead of Sunday’s FA Cup tie against Luton, Lampard said: “I don’t listen to it. “There’s something everywhere if you want to scroll through social media. I don’t do that. “I’m not stupid, I know the pressures that come with managing a top football club but I only do my job. It doesn’t matter to me.” During Lampard’s playing spell at Stamford Bridge, he saw eight permanent managers sacked by billionaire owner, Roman Abramovich.
