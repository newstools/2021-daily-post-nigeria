The Imo State government led by Senator Hope Uzodinma has appealed to contractors earlier engaged by the immediate past Governor, Emeka Ihedioha to tow the path of patriotism and return the monies given to them for road reconstruction and rehabilitation in the state. The State Commissioner for Works, Ralph Nwosu, while briefing newsmen said the state government had made frantic efforts to reach out to them in a bid to recover all the funds mobilized them but not accounted for. Nwosu said the immediate past government engaged in extravagant expenses which included an upfront payment of road contractors who disappeared into thin air as soon as Governor Uzodinma came on board. He further disclosed that out of 29 road contracts the government inherited, it had extended it to 49 owing to the deplorable condition of Imo roads. He regretted that Imo is still grappling with the issue of road reconstruction and rehabilitation, blaming it on the previous governments. The Commissioner recounted the Governorâ€™s achievements in one year, promising that all the road projects embarked upon would be completed within the shortest possible time. Meanwhile, the Commissioner has said the government may employ other workable means to recover all the monies paid to ghost contractors, stressing that it was Imo task payers money.
