Former Manchester United goalkeeper, Edwin van der Sar, has urged midfielder, Donny Van de Beek not to seek an exit from the club due to his lack of regularly playing game time. Van der Sar believes Van de Beek will eventually get there at Old Trafford, adding that there is no shame for him to struggle to break into a Man United side that boasts the likes of Paul Pogba, Bruno Fernandes, Nemanja Matic and Scott McTominay in their midfield options. The Ajax CEO added that he does not doubt that the Dutch international will come good and remain highly regarded at the Red Devils. Van de Beek has not featured regularly for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side since he joined Man United from Ajax for £35million in the 2020 summer transfer window. The 23-year-old didn’t feature for Man United in their 0-0 draw with Liverpool at Anfield last Sunday. “I do talk to more people at the club [Manchester United] about [Donny van de Beek]. He has Fantastic attitude, he is doing well in training,” Van der Sar told Ziggo Sport ahead of Man United’s away Premier League clash with Fulham on Wednesday night. “It’s hard [for him] because Pogba is coming back, Fernandes is very important, Matic and McTominay, who are there. “There is no shame at all. It is a big club too, isn’t it? Of course, it is a large amount (the transfer fee), but they are confident that he will get there.”
