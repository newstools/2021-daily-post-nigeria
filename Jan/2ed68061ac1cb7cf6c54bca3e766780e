The federal government says COVID-19 vaccine is expected to be rolled out from late March or April 2021. Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire made this known on Monday at the Presidential Task Force (PTF) briefing in Abuja. He said the quantity ordered from AVATT of the Africa Union Commission will depend on the country’s capacity to dispense them to avoid wastage. The minister disclosed that Nigeria is exploring all options to ensure the vaccination of 70 percent of Nigerians by 2023. “We are negotiating with many parties and planning for flawless execution using recent experience from polio eradication in the face of a global scramble for vaccines,” Ehanire said. He noted that apart from the 100,000 doses allocated as the first wave to Nigeria by the COVAX facility, the government also placed orders for 10 million doses through the AVATT. “Nigeria has an indigenous vaccine candidate which will require considerable investment to get through trials. We shall seek sponsorship to take the initiative further”, Ehanire added.
