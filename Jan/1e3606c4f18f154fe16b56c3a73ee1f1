Manchester United will clash with bitter rivals Liverpool in the FA Cup fourth round at 5pm on Saturday, 24 January. United, who travel to Anfield this Sunday in the Premier League, will play host to Jurgen Klopp’s side and the match will be aired live on the BBC. Chelsea welcome Championship side Luton Town at midday, while Manchester City face Cheltenham Town a day earlier on January 23. City are scheduled to kick off at 5.30 pm at the Jonny-Rocks Stadium. Swansea City are also in action against Nottingham Forest, with the clash also being shown on the 23rd at 3 pm. United’s tie with Liverpool is unarguably the tie of the fourth round, with the winner set to be one of the favourites to lift the cup in May. Liverpool, meanwhile, dispatched Aston Villa’s youngsters with a resounding 4-1 win in their third-round clash at Villa Park.
