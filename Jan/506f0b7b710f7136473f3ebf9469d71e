Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has urged midfielder, Donny van de Beek to stay at the club, after suggestions, he should try to leave in January. Van de Beek has been advised to leave Old Trafford, to avoid losing his place in the Dutch national team ahead of the European Championships. The midfielder has made only two Premier League starts since his £40 million move from Ajax in the summer. Solskjaer, however, has revealed he has spoken to Van de Beek about his situation and insists he will get game time, starting with the FA Cup third round tie with Watford on Saturday. “You don’t expect people who care for him to be quiet at times, especially when they want the best for them. Donny is going to play [against Watford], it’s another chance for him. “I’ve spoken to him and made him aware of how much we rate him, but he will play [against Watford] and it’s a good chance again for him to kick on,” Solskjaer told a news conference.
