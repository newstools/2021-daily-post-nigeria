The Federal Government has directed the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission to suspend the recently adjusted electricity tariff. The Minister of Power, Sale Mamman, made the announcement in a statement on Thursday. He said a committee has been set up to work on the new electricity tariffs and should be allowed to complete its work before any adjustments. Recall that NERC had on Tuesday increased the electricity tariff payable by power consumers across the country. The commission also blamed the N2 to N4 adjustment in tariff on inflation and movement in foreign exchange rates. However, Mamman said he directed NERC to suspend the implementation of the duly performed minor review to allow the conclusion of dialogue with Labour centers. “The public is aware that the Federal Government and the Labour Centers have been engaged in positive discussions about the electricity sector. ”Some of the achievements of this deliberation with Labour are the accelerated rollout of the National Mass Metering Plan, clampdowns on estimated billing, and the reduction in tariff rates.‌ “It should be clear to all that the regulator must be allowed to perform its function. “The role of the Government is not to set tariffs, but also to provide policy guidance, protect consumers and for investors to engage directly with consumers. ”To promote a constructive conclusion of the dialogue with the Labour Centers, I have directed NERC to suspend the implementation of the duly performed minor review (which adjusted tariffs between N2 per kWh and N4 per kWh) until the conclusion of the Joint Ad Hoc Committee’s work at the end of January 2021. “I would like to state again that this Administration is committed to creating a sustainable, electricity market for the benefit of all Nigerians,” the statement said.
