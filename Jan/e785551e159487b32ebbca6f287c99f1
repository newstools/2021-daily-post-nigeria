US Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will resign from the Senate today, as all is set for her swearing-in on Wednesday, January 20, 2021. Harris will officially leave the legislature ending her four years as a lawmaker after she became the first female, first black and first South Asian vice president of the US. Her aides have confirmed Harris has already started the process of her resignation, according to NDTV. Sheâ€™s said to have informed California Governor Gavin Newsom of the moves, to enable him appoint fellow Democrat Alex Padilla. She will formally announce her resignation on Monday but will not be given a floor speech, aides confirmed. Harris won her seat in November 2016 and was sworn in January 2017, becoming the first black woman in California to serve as a senator.
