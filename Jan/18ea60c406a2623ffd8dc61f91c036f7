Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has directed the operatives of Eastern Security Network, ESN, to cease fire with military men in Orlu area of Imo State. A clash between operatives of ESN and soldiers in Orlu area of Imo State had led to a death while scores were injured. However, Kanu said based on the intelligence available, the army and the police had withdrawn their operatives from Orlu. Against this backdrop, the IPOB leader directed ESN to ceasefire and be vigilant of Fulanis herdsmen. Kanu, in a tweet wrote: “Credible intelligence indicates that the army and police reinforcement deployed from Owerri have been ordered to withdraw from Orlu. “For this reason, I hereby direct the officers and men of the Eastern Security Network to stand down, while remaining vigilant to any Fulani terrorist activity in Biafra land.” Soldiers were said to have been unable to arrest ESN operatives due to their use of traditional powers.
