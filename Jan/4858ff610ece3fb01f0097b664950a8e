Police in Ogun State have arrested “three members of Eiye confraternity for threatening to kill one Teslim Lateef, who refused to be initiated into their cult group. The suspects, Olajide Shittu, Emmanuel Fidelis and Sunkanmi Ifelodun were arrested on Thursday following a report lodged at Ajuwon police station by Lateef. Lateef, DAILY POST learnt, told the police that the three suspects had been threatening to kill him for quite some time over his refusal to join the Eiye confraternity. According to him, the suspects had promised to get rid of him to avoid being exposed. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST on Saturday that the DPO of Ajuwon police division, SP Andrew Akinseye, who had been monitoring the suspects, led his men to their hideout and got them arrested. “They have all confessed being members of Eiye cult group and that they were trying to recruit more members into their fold,” Oyeyemi said in a statement. Meanwhile, the case has been ordered to be transferred to the state CIID by the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun. Ajogun appealed to cultists in the state to renounce their membership before the long arm of the law caught up with them.
