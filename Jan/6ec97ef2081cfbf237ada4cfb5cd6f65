Farmers, forest guards and drivers in Ondo State, on Thursday, expressed satisfaction with the seven days ultimatum Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu gave herdsmen to vacate forest reserves across the state. The groups, who stormed Akure, the state capital, stated that they were the most affected with the incessant banditry and kidnappings in the state. While emphasizing that some of the members had been either kidnapped or killed, they said the decision taken by the state governor was done in the best interest of the people in the state .  Some of the farmers said if the current state of insecurity is not urgently checked, it might lead to famine in the state, while the drivers emphasized that commercial drivers were no longer safe when driving through the state. According to the Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, NURTW, in the state, Jacob Adejo, his members need protection as herders attacked them with impunity as well as kidnapped them while going about their legitimate business.
