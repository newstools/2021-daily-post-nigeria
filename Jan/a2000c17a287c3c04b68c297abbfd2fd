A female worker at the Akure outlet of Shoprite in Ondo State has reportedly committed suicide following suspension from work. The late worker identified as Jumoke Kehinde was found dead in her apartment on New Year’s eve at Kajola axis, along Oda-road, Akure, the state capital. An anonymous co-worker of hers suggested that Kehinde could have killed herself after she was suspended for resuming late to work. The colleague who described Kehinde’s move as strange, said it was normal for anyone who resumed late to work to be sanctioned. The deceased is suspected to have taken a poisonous substance likely to be insecticide. He said, “Kehinde was already set for the day’s sale after arranging her table that very day. She didn’t look like someone who was disturbed but left the mall at about 11am after receiving the suspension letter from management. “It’s around 5pm that we received a distress call that she was not feeling fine. One of the management staff went to check on her. “Kehinde was found on the floor of her room shaking while her body was oozing with snipper odour. Although, no empty can was found anywhere as she was rushed to the hospital. “After some time at the hospital, she was declared dead. One of her relatives said she did not show any sign of depression whatsoever. “I don’t see any reason why such issue would cause her to kill herself by committing suicide.” When contacted, the Ondo Police Spokesman, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro, said that the incident was not reported. Meanwhile, her body has been deposited in the morgue.
