The federal government may be tempted into declaring another lockdown in the country, after the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases crossed the 100,000 mark. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Sunday, January 10, reported 1,024 new cases. It brought the total number of infections to 100,087. NCDC also said the total number of deaths was now 1,358 and the case fatality rate was 1.5 per cent in the country. The public health agency added that Nigeria’s active cases were 18,699. Last week, the FG admitted it would be left with no option than to impose a fresh lockdown in the country, if the number of COVID-19 infections continue to spike. The National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Sani Aliyu, stated this on Friday during a media briefing in Abuja. Aliyu said the rising coronavirus infections were of concern and might require a fresh lockdown. He said, “If these numbers continue to go up and we start having significant deaths, we will have no option. If we do not want to lock down, now is the time to make sure that we follow the non-pharmaceutical interventions.”
