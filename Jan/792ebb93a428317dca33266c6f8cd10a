Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said Paul Pogba is “at his best” after the midfielder’s goal against Burnley sent them top of the Premier League. Pogba volleyed in Marcus Rashford’s cross to give United all three points at Turf Moor. It means Solskjaer’s team head into Sunday’s crucial clash with Liverpool three points clear at the summit. “I’ve always said Paul is a big player for us. He is a good character in the dressing room, he is always the one the lads look to and he’s a world champion of course, and I think he’s at his best at the moment,” Solskjaer said after the game. It is the first time the Red Devils have topped the Premier League in January since 2013, when Sir Alex Ferguson’s team went on to win the title. Solskjaer added: “What a brilliant position to be in. We know it’s going to be hard but we’re ready and hungry which is good and we couldn’t have asked for a better time to go there. “We go there knowing we’re playing the best team by a mile in the country in the last year and a half. We’re looking forward to it and it’s a great test of where we’re at against a good team. “Of course we know we’re going to the champions, they’ve had an unbelievable three-and-a-half seasons so we know that’s going to be a difficult game for us but we’re ready for it.”
