Former Big Brother Naija Housemate, Kaisha Umaru has debunked the reports that she and her fellow ex-housemate shared a kiss at a birthday party on Saturday. There have been reports going around the internet that the relationship between former BBNaija housemates, Erica Nlewedim and kiddwaya had crashed. The duo never came out publicly to state if the reports were true or why their relationship which began from during their stay at the Biggy’s house crashed. However, trouble started when Kaisha posted a video which ended abruptly with Kidd seen almost kissing her via her Instagram story while attending Praise’s birthday party on Saturday night. The video sparked a lot of dating rumors between them. While some Nigerians on social media dragged Kidddwaya for constantly disrespecting Erica adding that it was inappropriate of them to be seen in such situation, some were of the opinion that they both deserved to be together. Reacting, kaisha in a post via her Twitter account on Sunday stated that whatever misconception people had stemmed from
her carelessness. She also claimed she had too much to drink at the party that she unknowingly posted the video without releasing a full version of it. According to her, “Kidd is like a brother to me and I have never imagined kissing Kidd.Never!” “So I woke up to “Kidd kissed Kaisha last night”. How??? Oh yes I had too much to drink at Praise’s birthday party last night and I don’t remember kissing Kidd so where’s this coming from? “Kidd’s ritual of pouring drinks into our mouths is not new and we all know how playful he is. “Kidd is like a brother to me and I have never imagined kissing Kidd! Never!!! It’s my fault that I was careless last night; I had too much to drink. “My carelessness pushed a Negative Narrative about Kidd and I sincerely apologize for that.For those assuming on Kidd’s behavior saying he kissed me I have also released the full video so you see for yourself,” she said.
