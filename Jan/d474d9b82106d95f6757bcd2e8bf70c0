The police in Ogun State, on Wednesday, paraded 25 suspected cultists, who they said were nabbed during an initiation ceremony in Abeokuta, the state capital. While parading the suspects before journalists at the police headquarters, Eleweran, Abeokuta, the Ogun Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, said they were arrested alongside three herbalists, who conducted the initiation. Also, 34 others were apprehended for various crimes such as kidnapping, rape, murder, armed robbery and fraud. According to Ajogun, the suspected cultists were arrested as a result of an intelligence report that they were planning to unleash mayhem on members of the public after the initiation rites for new members in Ita-Oshin. Among those arrested were three young men, who were said to have beaten one 23-year-old Samuel Ajibade to death for allegedly stealing two phones in Ota. Also, one Tunde Bello, a taxi driver along the Mowe axis of the Lagos-Ibadan highway, who drove a woman into a bush to rape her and afterwards collected N140,000, was also paraded. As he spoke on other suspects, the Commissioner warned criminals to steer clear of Ogun State. He threatened that the police under his watch would continue to make all parts of the state inconducive for criminal elements.
