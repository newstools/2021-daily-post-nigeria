Femi Fani-Kayode, a former minister of aviation has condemned the attack on Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho’s house in Ibadan. DAILY POST earlier reported that Igboho’s house was set ablaze early Tuesday morning. The building burnt was his Soka residence in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital However, no one was reported dead or injured as at press time. Reacting, Fani-Kayode described the incident as cowardice. He warned those behind the incident to stop and avoid bloodshed before it’s too late. On his Twitter page, Fani-Kayode wrote: “Burning Igboho’s house at 3.00a.m. in the morning only proves that you are nothing but cowards and that you are running scared. I pray you do not get what you are looking for. “War, conflict, bloodshed and carnage are best avoided. Let your madness stop here before it is too late.” Recall that the Yoruba activist made headlines days ago after his ultimatum to the Fulani in Oyo to leave the State. He accused the Northerners of masterminding abductions and killings in the State. After the expiration of the deadline, the houses and cars of the Seriki Fulani in Igangan were destroyed This may be seen as a reprisal attack although Igboho denied being involved in the attack on Fulanis in Igangan.
