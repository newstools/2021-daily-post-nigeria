The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has supported the policy proposal by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), for students to undergo drug integrity test before admission into the University. NANS President, Asefon Sunday Daye, backed the initiative during a solidarity visit to the new Chairman/Chief Executive, NDLEA, Brig-Gen Buba Marwa, on Wednesday in Abuja. Daye said NANS supports drug test policy, as drug abuse had done more harm than good to the Nigerian students. “We don’t want Nigerian students to continue to die of drugs. “This initiative will not only prevent but would encourage students to stop the habit, knowing that the authorities would detect it. “From your antecedents, we can go to bed with our two eyes closed with the assurance that Nigeria is in safe hands, on drug control issues,” Daye said. Responding, Marwa applauded NANS for the visit, revealing that the decision to test students for drugs before admission into the university is by no means punitive. “Your buying into our drug testing among students is equally encouraging because there have been some objections to the drug testing initiative. “But we cannot watch our students use drugs and jump into a well thinking it is a swimming pool. “The testing of students is to determine their status early enough and decide the form of intervention to deploy. It is by no means punitive,” he assured.
