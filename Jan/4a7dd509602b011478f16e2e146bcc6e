A 24-year-old pregnant woman, Mariam Musa, has been arrested in Ede, Osun State for allegedly poisoning her three-year-old stepson, Rokeeb Musa. The incident happened on December 26, 2020. Mariam told DAILY POST that she killed the toddler out of jealousy, saying their husband; Musa, loved the son more than her daughter. The woman, who is the first wife of the husband, further confessed that she poisoned the boy with a pesticide (Rocket). The five months old pregnant woman confessed while being paraded by the Commissioner of Police in Osun State, Wale Olokode, on Tuesday at the State Command, Osogbo. Speaking, she accused the husband of showing more love and favour to the second wife because she had a male child while she (first wife) is yet to have a male. “I was sleeping inside my room when the boy came to me and I gave him the insecticide to drink. My husband was showing love and favour to the second wife. “I learnt fashion designing before I became a pap seller because the business was not moving. My husband arrived on the evening of my graduation as a certified fashion designer and spent N70 but he spent a lot during the second wife’s graduation as a hairdresser. “My husband bought plasma and cable television for the second wife while I have no television in my room. The second wife has been putting up some funny attitudes. She doesn’t answer if I greet her, even when I was sick, she didn’t ask after my health,” she added. After the death of the boy, Mariam said she confessed the crime to her husband due to her conscience. The police boss in the state, Olokode, however, told newsmen that the second wife reported the case at ‘B’ Division Ede on the same day of the incident. Olokode added that the child was taken to Muslim Hospital Ede but unfortunately, died while receiving treatment on 31 of December 2020.
