The police in Ogun State have arrested three men for allegedly beating a 23-year-old man to death over phone theft. Abimbola Oyeyemi, the State Police Public Relations Officer, confirmed this in a statement on Sunday. Oyeyemi identified the suspects, who were arrested on January 21, as Ugo Obi, Chinonso Jude, and Chibuke Samson. They are residents of MTN Street, Iju Ota. Oyeyemi said one Ajibade Gbenga had reported at Onipanu Divisional Headquarters that “his son, Samuel Ajibade, was alleged to have stolen two handsets by the suspects, consequent upon which the three suspects jointly beat him to state of comma.” He added that his son was rushed to Ota General Hospital, but was confirmed dead as soon as he got to the hospital by the doctor on duty. “Upon the report, the DPO Onipanu Division, CSP Bamidele Job led his detectives to the scene where the three suspects were quickly arrested,” Oyeyemi stated. According to Oyeyemi, the three suspects would have been lynched by an angry mob if not for the quick response of the police.

Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, CP Edward Ajogun has ordered the transfer of the case to the Homicide Section of the State CIID.
