Affirming dumping music, Eva on Thursday took to her Instagram page disclosing her reasons for abandoning music. A fan asked, “I still don’t know why you stopped making music,” Eva, responding, wrote: “I stopped to get back to my core essence. I stopped for me.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-862275 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eva.png" alt="" width="742" height="741" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eva.png 742w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eva-300x300.png 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eva-150x150.png 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eva-80x80.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px">
