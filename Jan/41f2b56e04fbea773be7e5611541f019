Imo West lawmaker, Senator Rochas Okorocha has suggested that the current administration is the way it is today because President Muhammadu Buhari did not surround himself with good people. Addressing reporters in Abuja on Monday, Okorocha said had the President done otherwise, the story would not have been the same today. The former Imo State Governor also said that the All Progressives Congress, APC, was hurriedly arranged to hijack power from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. “Political parties in Nigerian don’t have any ideology; it is just a vehicle to come to power. “So what we have is not the ideal thing, we have so many people who are not interested in working for the nation. “Take for instance if President Muhammadu Buhari had surrounded himself with good people, the story will not be the same today. “APC was a hurried arrangement, it was hurriedly formed to take power when the then government was drifting. “APC would have been better until people who were not members of the party; people who came for congratulatory message hijacked the party and became Lords.” The former Governor, who also announced that the movement for a new political front has begun, had recently while on a visit to the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, dropped a huge hint on the prospect of a new political force ahead of the 2023 general elections in the country. Okorocha at the Commissioning of the Rumueche- Rumuakunde- Ohna- Awuse Road in Emohua LGA of Rivers State called for the integration of like minds from the PDP and the APC to accelerate the level of progress in the country.
