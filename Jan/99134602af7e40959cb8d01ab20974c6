Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) has warned the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) to desist from “plot” to infiltrate the Southwest Security Network (Amotekun). The Yoruba organisation gave the warning in reaction to MACBAN’s call for inclusion of its members and other ethnic bodies in the outfit. OPC said the demand was a ploy to weaken the Amotekun and put the region in “perpetual security threat”. The group’s Publicity Secretary, Yinka Oguntimehin, in a statement on Tuesday, advised MACBAN to drop the idea. “OPC will never allow Miyetti Allah to set our region on fire. We cannot afford to see the South-West facing the kind of security challenges faced daily in the North-East and North-West. “Our group will never fold its arms and allow overrun by herdsmen and marauders. That is why we are warning leaders of the group to desist from their sinister motives and leave Amotekun alone in the region.” Oguntimehin lambasted the leader of herders in Oyo State, Ibrahim Jiji for making the “unrealistic request”, maintaining that MACBAN lacked credibility. The spokesman urged the Federal Government to beam a searchlight on Jiji, noting that no Yoruba group ever demanded to be included into Northern formations like Hisbah, Middle Belt security outfit, among others. He vowed that OPC will resist any attempt to soil the name of Amotekun.
