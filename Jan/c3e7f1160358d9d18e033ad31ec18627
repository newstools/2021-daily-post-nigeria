Premier League holders, Liverpool, have announced that their defender, Adam Lewis, has left Anfield to join Plymouth Argyle on loan. Liverpool disclosed this on Thursday ahead of their Premier League clash with Manchester United on Sunday. The statement read, “Adam Lewis has joined League One side, Plymouth Argyle, on loan for the rest of 2020-21, subject to international clearance. “The left-back will link up with Plymouth until the end of this season after returning to Liverpool from a spell with Amiens SC in France. “The 21-year-old made nine appearances for Amiens in Ligue 2 during the first half of the campaign, having made the move last August.” Lewis made his senior debut for Liverpool in their FA Cup win against Shrewsbury Town last year.
