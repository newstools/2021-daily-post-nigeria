The General Manager of Adapalm Industry Nigeria Ltd in Imo State, Dr. Goddy Esom Obodo, has clarified the recent explosion at the company which was rumoured to have left many workers dead and scores wounded. The GM while entertaining questions from DAILY POST on Tuesday, said that many people had cashed in on the incident to drag his management to the mud. He explained that only one person died during the explosion contrary to the news making the rounds that over seven persons died. “Expectedly, some people are fond of making a mountain out of a mole hill. You should know that there are people who are not happy that I’m here. “It is true that there was an explosion and we are still tracing the root cause of it. It is probably as a result of intense pressure in the nucleus that gave rise to the explosion. “We are not God as to have envisaged what would happened in the next few minutes. I was even in a meeting with the deputy Governor when I received the call. I immediately rushed down to the mill to see things for myself. “The person that died is not our staff, he was a contractor recently assigned for a job. The other four were injured and are currently receiving treatment at St. Anthony’s Hospital Amafor, Ohaji/Egbema and Federal Medical Centre Owerri. They are responding to treatment. “You see, everything is not politics. This has to do with people’s lives. Let us stop playing politics with everything,” he said. One of the victims, Amuka Remigius from Agwa who spoke to our correspondent thanked God for saving his life. He said that they will soon be discharged. Another victim who gave his name as Ali Effiong from Akwa-ibom State sustained degrees of injury. He said government should look into the industry and refurbish it to avoid further occurrences.
