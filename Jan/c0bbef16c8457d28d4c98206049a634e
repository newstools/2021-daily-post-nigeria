US House of Representatives member, Marjorie Taylor Greene has moved for the impeachment of President-elect, Joe Biden. Greene, the House Representative for Georgia’s 14th congressional district, also accused Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker of bringing COVID-19 positive members into the Capitol to vote for her to be Speaker. Joe Biden will be sworn-in as the 46th president of the United States of America on January 20, 2021 in a ceremony that will not be attended by the outgoing President, Donald Trump. And without giving any reason at all, Greene is moving for the impeachment of Biden by the public. “Impeach Joe Biden! Text impeach to 55444,” she tweeted. She lashed out at the Speaker, Pelosi “… Bringing covid positive Members into the Capitol to vote for her to be Speaker during week 1.” Greene was elected to Congress in the November 2020 elections, and she took office on January 3, 2021 and from all indications, she is a die-hard supporter of President Trump. Trump was impeached for the second time on Wednesday, having been accused of inciting his supporters to launch a deadly attack on the US Capitol to stop Joe Biden certification by the Congress.
