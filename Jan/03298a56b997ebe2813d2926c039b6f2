The little girl in Bauchi State, whose sexual organ was removed by suspected teenage ritualists, is alive. She survived the assault and is responding to treatment at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH). Bauchi State Police Command spokesperson, DSP Ahmed Mohammed Wakil told PRNigeria that she was rushed to Kano after rescue. The Public Relations Officer said she was recuperating with a very good chance of survival. Hauwa Inuwa Dutse, AKTH Public Relations Officer assured that doctors were doing their best to get the victim back to her normal life. “We are taking care of her medically and monitoring to ensure that she is stable without other underlining medical ailments or issues which may include depression or infection”, Dutse said. Bauchi Governor, Bala Mohammed has promised that the state government will foot the girl’s bill. Two teenagers cut off her private part after a “female native doctor” promised them N500,000.
