Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan has warned that the Bishop of Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Mathew Kukah must not be harmed. Omokri warned that harming Bishop Kukah could lead to trouble that would consume Nigeria. He issued the warning in reaction to the quit notice issued to Kukah by the Muslim Solidarity Forum in Sokoto State. The forum had called on Bishop Kukah to apologize or leave Sokoto State over his alleged ” malicious vituperations against Islam and Muslims”. The forum had enjoined Bishop Kukah to tender an unreserved apology to the Muslim Ummah over his Christmas message to Nigerians. Reacting, Kukah had said he would apologise if he is shown any part of his Christmas sermon that insulted Islam. Responding to the quit notice, Omokri in a series of tweets wrote: “Those who threatened Bishop Kukah should pray he lives and thrives. “Because if we hear that Kukah had a headache, or a tale about #COVID-19, or that something happened to his car or house, those who made the threat will know the meaning of 1 John 4:4 “Harming Bishop Kukah in any way, shape or form may cause the type of trouble that may consume Nigeria. It will be wise for those threatening him to hold their peace. Millions of Nigerians stand with Kukah and are capable of matching threat for threat!”
