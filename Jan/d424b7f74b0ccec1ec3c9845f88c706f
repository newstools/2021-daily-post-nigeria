A woman, who was identified as Alhaja Morenikeji Salami, has been shot by some suspected Fulani herdsmen. She was waylaid while driving to her new work-site, around Idofe, Oru-Awa area of Ijebu North Local Government area of Ogun. DAILY POST reports that Salami had her thumb cut off by a bullet said to have been fire by the herdsmen. The woman’s jaw was also pierced by the suspects who emerged from the bush while grazing their cows. In a viral video on Saturday, the woman was seen in severe pains as she was being treated at the hospital. According to a female voice accompanying the video, Salami drove into the herdsmen numbering about eight and she was shot while trying to reverse. At first, her tyres were shot to prevent her from escaping, after which she was shot two times. It was said the woman was left alone after she pretended to have died, as the herdmen went back into the bush. My mother said she managed to get down from the car after waiting for the herdsmen to go. “After she managed to alight from the car, she saw a tipper lorry and flagged it down. The driver rescued her and took her to Oru,” a daughter of the woman said. DAILY POST gathered that the victim was rejected at the general hospital and at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital (OSUTH) for lack of space. The Ogun State Police Spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi has confirmed the incident. Oyeyemi said three of the herdsmen were arrested at night after they returned to take away the cattle they left behind. He disclosed that the arrested suspects have been transferred to the state police headquarters, Eleweran.
