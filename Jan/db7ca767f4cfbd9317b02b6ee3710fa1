The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 is making progress on provision of vaccines for Nigerians. The Chairman and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, gave the update on Tuesday, in Abuja. Mustapha assured that additional information on vaccine introduction and deployment plans would be made public in due course. “What is confronting us is a critical phase of infections globally. We are constantly reviewing our strategy to emerging situations especially in risk communication, vaccine hesitancy, fake news/disinformation,” he said. The SGF confirmed sanctions against passengers who defaulted on day-7 post arrival tests. He said their passport numbers have been published and travel restriction imposed for a period of six months effective from January 1, 2021. “The PTF has generated over 20,000 inbound passengers that have also defaulted. The publication will continue weekly till it is exhausted.” The SGF warned that every defaulter is a threat to public health. Mustapha advised Nigerians to ensure family members, friends and associates comply with laid down rules.
