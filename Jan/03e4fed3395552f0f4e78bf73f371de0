The Kano State Government has said that it will continue to pursue legal action against the alleged blasphemous singer, Yahaya Sharif, whose death sentence by an Upper Sharia Court was quashed due to an error in judgment. The Court of Appeal presided over by Justice Nuradeen Sagir who is the State Chief Justice had ordered the retrial of the singer, Yahaya Sharif, at the same Sharia Upper Court but with a full legal representation. The State Attorney General, Barrister MA Lawan, speaking after the court session, said the judgment was a victory for the people of Kano State for the fact that the appellant counsel’s claim was that the whole trial was done contrary to the constitution of the nation, because the Sharia court was not recognized by the constitution of the nation. He said another victory for the People of Kano is that the Appeal Court now recognizes that Sharia Court is fully recognized by the nation’s constitution and that its judgments are valid. The Attorney General said, a minor, Umar Faruk who was earlier sentenced to 10 years by the Sharia Court was discharged because he was a minor and that he was not given proper legal representation, and not because the Sharia Court lacks jurisdiction to try him. “The only reasons provided was that he was not provided with legal representation and his judgment was rushed and that in the case of the blasphemous singer, Yahaya Sharif, the government is now ready to give him full legal representation and charge him again on the same offence,” the Attorney General added.
