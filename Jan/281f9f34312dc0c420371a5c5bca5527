A gynaecologist, Dr Jen Gunter, has advised women against shaving their pubic hair. Gunter, who is author of The Vagina Bible, warned women against waxing or shaving their hair, because, according to her, it can cause “microscopic trauma” that can lead to infections. She said the hair is necessary to protect the skin by acting as a barrier against the outside world and that shaving may also reduce sexual pleasure. “Hygiene” is the most common reason women remove their hair. “Waxing, shaving or ‘sugaring’ – mixing sugar, lemon juice and water to create a wax-like gel – may do more harm than good,” Dr Gunter warned according to BBC. “You are causing microscopic trauma to the skin,” she added. “Pubic hair has a function, it is probably a mechanical barrier and protection for the skin,” she said. “It may also have a role in sexual functioning because each pubic hair is attached to a nerve ending, that’s why it hurts to remove it.” Dr. Gunter advised those who still want to shave their pubic hair to use a clean razor and shave in the direction of the hair. She warned that going “against the grain” increases the risk of ingrown hairs, which can become infected. And for people going for a wax, she said they must ensure the technician does not “double dip” the wooden sticks used.
