Shehu Sani, a former Kaduna lawmaker, has condemned the plans by President Muhammadu Buhari and government officials to receive COVID-19 vaccine on live Tv. Recall that Faisal Shuaib, the Executive Director of National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), disclosed that President Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and other prominent Nigerians had expressed readiness to receive the vaccine on live television. Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti state also disclosed that governors of 36 states have agreed to take the vaccine on live Tv. Shehu Sani, reacting, said there is no need to vaccinate the President and governors on live Tv. According to him, it was only necessary that the government ensures that the same vaccine given on Live Tv to VIPs is the same given to ordinary Nigerians. On his Twitter page, the former lawmaker wrote: “No need to Vaccinate the VIPs on live TV. Just do the right thing. When you vaccinate the leaders with Pfizer, make sure the people are also vaccinated with Pfizer. “When you vaccinate the People with Russian or Chinese vaccine, make sure the leaders are also vaccinated with same brand.” Meanwhile, Nigeria intends to get 42 million COVID-19 vaccines to cover one-fifth of its population through the global COVAX scheme.
