Modern and sleek logo, new wrestling show and fresh content on the cards… [Johannesburg, SA]: As of 1 February, TNT Africa, home of the best contemporary and Hollywood blockbusters, will be revealing its 2021 channel refresh packed with an exciting slate of tailor-made shows and content that will keep African audiences glued to their screens. With this move, the channel aims to emphasise its commitment to delivering relevant and exciting programming to African fans! As part of the refresh, TNT Africa will debut AEW DYNAMITE, the weekly flagship show from All Elite Wresting, the new professional wrestling league that is taking the world by storm. The launch kicks off on Friday, 5 February, at 13h20 (CAT) with the first five episodes of the new season. Then, every Friday night, during prime time at 20h00 (CAT), the channel will premiere the recent high-octane matches, two days after the US premiere, and after that repeated twice throughout the week. AEW offers an alternative to mainstream wrestling with a roster of world-class talent offering TNT Africa viewers a spectacular weekly wrestling programme jam-packed with action and the unexpected. TNT Africa’s exciting content line up and brand-new, refreshed look are a perfect fit for the channel’s move towards being more powerful and modern. This is aligned with the global look of the channel – that people from all over the globe can recognise. TNT Africa will continue to launch their exclusive, brand-new, TNT Original Movies on the channel on the first Thursday of every month. These include a wide range of mainstream entertainment genres, featuring renowned, and rising international stars! The month of February will kick off with, Straight Up, a romantic movie from writer, director and star James Sweeney. As part of the fresh, entertainment-filled offering, TNT has an exciting line-up of the very best action-driven, pulse-raising slate, mixed with romantic gems and hilarious comedies including titles like Splash and the Best Man Holiday to experience the accidental side of love on Valentine’s Day; great channel premiers such as Crank High Voltage and Point Break in February’s Adrenaline Rush stunt; Malcolm X and Just Cause will help us fight for our rights on Human Rights Day; and in April you can celebrate the Oscars with Academy Award-winning titles such as E.T and Gladiator. “TNT is excited to usher in a new era in entertainment that is attuned to our audience needs and appetite. Despite how far we’ve come, we remain steadfastly dedicated to giving our African audience premium content, and the launch of AEW DYNAMITE and the channel refresh bear testament of this,” says Guillermo Farré, Head of the WarnerMedia General Entertainment channels across France, Iberia and Africa.
