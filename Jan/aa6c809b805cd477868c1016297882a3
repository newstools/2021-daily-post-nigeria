Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has confirmed that five key players will miss his side’s Premier League against Chelsea on Sunday evening. Guardiola disclosed this on Friday at his pre-match press conference. Recall that Man City stars, Kyle Walker and Gabriel Jesus tested positive for COVID-19 before Christmas, and three more positive cases were confirmed on Monday. With an outbreak of the infection in Man City’s squad, their last Premier League fixture against Everton was postponed until further notice. “We have five [players out] right now,” Guardiola was quoted by Man City’s official website as saying. “Five players. The first cases were two players and two staff – and then three players the second time. “The Premier League will not allow us [to name the players], but tomorrow you will see because they will not travel. They told us not to, and some clubs announce, some don’t. “We have to respect the privacy of players. But tomorrow you will see the three important players who are not there. I am not allowed to tell you.” The kick-off time for Chelsea vs Man City is 5: 30 pm, Nigerian time.
