Manchester United have confirmed that Amad Diallo will wear the No.19 shirt. The Red Devils completed a £36million deal for Diallo during the last summer deadline day. But the winger has spent the first half of the current season at Atalanta. Having acquired the necessary paperwork, Diallo has now completed the formalities of his move and has been officially confirmed as a United player ahead of this weekend’s FA Cup third round tie against Watford. He will now inherit the No.19 shirt, previously used by Marcus Rashford. However, the Ivorian is likely to be gradually eased into the first team picture. Speaking about his move, Diallo said: “After waiting since the summer, it is finally a dream come true to complete my move to Manchester United. “I am hugely ambitious and there is so much that I want to achieve in the game; when I spoke to the manager I knew that I had joined the perfect club.”
