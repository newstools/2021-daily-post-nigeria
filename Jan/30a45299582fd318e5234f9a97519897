The President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Amb. Prof. George Obiozor, on Wednesday cautioned the leader of the Indegenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu against going ahead with his secessionist struggle. Obiozor gave the warning during his maiden press conference at the Ohanaeze Ndigbo secretariat in Enugu. In a 27-point message to Ndigbo, the Ohanaeze leader, who is still facing litigation in court over his emergence, said “the Igbo nation is not at war with Nigeria and has nothing pending before any institutional authority that demands a separate existence from Nigeria.” He added that, “Nnamdi Kanu is one of us and must listen to some of us for several reasons. The fact and reality are that the issues of Biafra are above and beyond his capacity to decide. “He must listen because he is one of us and we are all in this dilemma together, and our mutual and collective responsibilities are sacred and must be respected. “Consequently, all actions or utterances that put Ndigbo in present and imminent danger or harm’s way must be avoided.” Drumming home his point, he said Ndigbo can still unite again “not really as Igbo state union but somehow closer.” He further stated that security and safety of Ndigbo will be the priority of his leadership. DAILY POST reports that Nnamdi Kanu had earlier said he would not recognize Obiozor as the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo. This is also as the Ohanaeze election produced parallel executive members, with Hon. Chief Chidi Ibe, leading another group, a matter that is now subject to the determination of the court.
