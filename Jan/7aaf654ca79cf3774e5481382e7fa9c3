Liverpool are considering a shock move to sign Shkodran Mustafi from Arsenal, as Jurgen Klopp tries to sort out his defensive crisis before the January window closes, the UK Telegraph reports. The Premier League champions have been without first-choice centre-back pairing Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez for much of the 2020/2021 season. The duo have sustained serious knee ligament injuries. Their absence has been felt even harder because of Joel Matip’s sketchy injury record, with the Cameroonian again picking up a knock against Spurs, while stand-in defender Fabinho also has a niggle. Liverpool have been linked with a host of defenders like Lille’s Sven Botman and RB Leipzig’s Dayot Upamecano, but neither club are likely to sell during January, particularly so late in the window. Klopp has now set his sights on Mustafi, with the 28-year-old not starting a single league fixture for the Gunners this season. The German defender also has six months left on his current contract, but Arsenal could terminate his contract early this month and make him a free agent.
