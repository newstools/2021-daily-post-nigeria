Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, has declared that ‘doomsday predictions about Nigeria will not work. There have been several predictions by church leaders and other individuals concerning Nigeria in the New Year, most of which have been negative. The Minister also lambasted the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, accusing the party of playing a very poor opposition role. Lai Mohammed said this at a press conference in Lagos State on Monday where he berated the PDP for bad-mouthing the government of the day. “Let me also take this opportunity to condemn the constant infantile press releases by the unserious, unimaginative and drab opposition, which misconstrues opposition as constantly shooting down anything the government of the day does or bad-mouthing whatever Mr. President does or says. “There is more to opposition than predictable and bring-it-down-at-all-cost media interventions. They messed up in
government, and they are messing up even more in opposition. No lessons learnt either way. “Finally, let me say this: Doomsday predictions about Nigeria will not come to pass. Nigeria will not become a failed state, but will rise to become a more respected member of the comity of nations,” he said.
