Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has hailed Kieran Tierney as a “natural leader” and potential future captain. Tierney scored and provided an assist as the Gunners hammered West Brom 4-0 on Saturday. The Scot has been ever present in Arteta’s side, starting 16 of Arsenal’s 17 league fixtures this season. When asked by reporters if the 23-year-old could be a future Arsenal skipper, Arteta said: “I think he can be, because he has the respect and the admiration of every member of the staff and every player. “It’s just the way he is, he does it in a natural way. He’s a shy boy, but I think he represents all of the values we want to install and that are in the DNA of this club. “He came here, and it took him a while, he had a really bad injury… but he’s a natural leader. You see how he behaves on that pitch, and when he talks, he says the right thing and it’s exactly what we’re looking for.”
