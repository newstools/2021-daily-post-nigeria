Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is keen for the club to keep winger, Jesse Lingard in the January transfer window, according to The Telegraph. Solskjaer believes that Lingard ‘could still have a useful squad role’ at Old Trafford this season. Lingard has made just three appearances across the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup for Man United this season. He has been linked with a loan move away from the Red Devils this month, with Nice, Aston Villa, Newcastle United and West Ham all interested in the England star. The 28-year-old has not featured at all in either the Premier League or Champions League this season for Man United. Lingard will now hope to feature for Solskjaer’s side this weekend when they tackle Liverpool in the Premier League at Anfield. Meanwhile, Former Manchester United strikers, Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Owen have told Lingard, to leave Old Trafford straight away to save his career.
