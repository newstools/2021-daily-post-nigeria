The Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, has declared that the days of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, are numbered. AYCF National President, Yerima Shettima made the declaration in an exclusive chat with DAILY POST. Shettima said the Nigerian government should devise a means to arrest and repatriate Kanu to face his trial. He pointed out that Kanu was taking advantage of the unemployment rate in Nigeria to recruit people and instigate them against other Nigerians. According to Shettima: “In a normal society that rabble rouser who claims to be a leader from nowhere should not be taken seriously. “But unfortunately for us, we have a society with high rate of unemployment, bad economy and high rate of crime, so it’s easy for Kanu to recruit people and instigate them against innocent Nigerians. “But I know his days are numbered because this can’t continue and as far as I’m concerned, I have never seen him as a serious human being. “Nigerian government must devise a means through interpol to get him arrested and made to face his trial.”
