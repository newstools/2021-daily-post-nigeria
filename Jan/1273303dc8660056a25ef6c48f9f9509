Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, has claimed he avoids talking about President Muhammadu Buhari, for the sake of his sanity. Soyinka stated this while answering questions on Kaftan TV. He described the new Lagos-Abeokuta-Ibadan standard gauge train as marvelous and long overdue. Speaking onboard the new train, Soyinka said he would not like to talk about Buhari government because he imagined it does not exist. When asked whether the new train was a plus to Buhari, he replied, “I don’t want to talk about Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. “I think it is best for my sanity just to avoid that overall question. “I can take bits and pieces of Nigeria’s present predicament, but I think for one’s sense of balance, one must forget the existence of the Buhari administration.”
