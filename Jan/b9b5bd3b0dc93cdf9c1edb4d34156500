No fewer than 3,187 traffic offenders have been arrested by the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Lagos Command. The Lagos Sector Commander, Mr Olusegun Ogungbemide, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said they were arrested during the “30 days operation zero tolerance” in the state. He said the offenders were arrested for allegedly committing 3,708 traffic offences between Dec. 15, 2020, and Jan. 15. Ogungbemide added that officers of the command impounded 1,430 vehicles and confiscated 1,757 others for failure to meet the roadworthiness requirements during the period under review. According to him, a total of 46 road traffic crashes were recorded with five fatal accidents. He said the offences included “Light/Sign violation (LSV) 608; Seat belt violation (SUV), 609, Failure to install Speed Limiting Device (SLD), 513, and driving with worn-out tyres (TYY), 505.” The sector commander expressed worry that some commercial drivers disconnected the speed limit devices in their vehicles, exposing passengers to danger. He explained that the practice by commercial drivers was on the increase, forcing operatives of the command to be strict with enforcement. “It was discovered that the arrested vehicles disconnected their speed limit devices, which is also an indicator that commuters in such vehicles are exposed to danger. “The commuters are also exposed to crashes as a result of uncontrolled speed that could lead to loss of control of the vehicle, which could also lead to fatality. “It is unfortunate that we still have unpatriotic drivers who are disloyal to the driving rules and law of the land,” Ogunbemide said. The Lagos sector commander further urged other motorists yet to install the speed limit device to do so, adding that officers and men of the corps were on the lookout for offenders
