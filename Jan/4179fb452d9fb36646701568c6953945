Doyin Okupe, a former presidential aide, has reacted to the revelation by his son, Bolu, that he is gay. DAILY POST recalls that Bolu made the revelation on his Instagram while sharing his photo. Reacting to the post, Okupe said his son is going through a ‘Spiritual Challenge.’ On his Instagram page, Okupe with a picture of his son wrote: “The picture below is that of Mobolurin Okupe. He is my son. I gave him the name MOBA OLUWA RIN, ( I WALKED WITH GOD) because he was born at the time I gave my life to Christ. “For me, I look beyond the surface or the physical. Here, I see a major spiritual challenge ahead but I know as my God liveth, this whole saga will end up in Praise to the Almighty Jehova who I serve day and night.” He mentioned that he had been aware of his son’s sexuality for a while but had stood against it. Giving his reasons, Okupe said that as an evangelist, homosexuality goes against his Christian faith. “I have been aware of Bolu’s new orientation for a while now. “He knows that as a Christian and a witness for Christ ( an evangelist) I am vehemently opposed to homosexuality as it runs contrary to the avowed precepts of my Christian faith,” his post read. Bolu graduated in 2015 from the University of Manchester, United Kingdom (UK).
