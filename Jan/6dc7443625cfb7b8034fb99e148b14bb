The senior pastor of Awaiting the Second Coming of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has warned President Muhammadu Buhari against arresting Sunday Igboho. The cleric condemned the federal government for going after Igboho after he issued an ultimatum to Fulanis in Oyo to exit the state. The Yoruba activist, real name, Sunday Adeyemo, reiterated his deadline on Friday. Giwa, in a statement on Saturday, said Igboho’s arrest “will hasten the disintegration of Nigeria”. The Christian leader accused the President of protecting Fulani “while they continue to kill our people”. “Why didn’t IGP arrest Miyetti Allah and their representatives in Abuja? Let me inform you that Sunday Igboho is doing the right thing for the entire Yoruba nation. “You can’t threaten, kill or arrest him unless you want to arrest all of us. When a government fails in its responsibilities to protect the citizens, people have no option than to protect themselves. “Nigerians have tolerated Fulani herdsmen for over five years, and it is time all of us rise up to defend ourselves.” Giwa added that only a despicable person would be happy with President Buhari’s handling of security challenges in Nigeria over the years.
