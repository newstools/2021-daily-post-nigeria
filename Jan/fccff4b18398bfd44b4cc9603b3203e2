Fulham’s trip to Burnley on Sunday has been postponed. The Premier League clash was scheduled to kick off 12 noon GMT on Sunday and becomes the third game to be called off because of COVID-19 cases at the London club. This comes after Fulham’s away game against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday was also called off, because of a “significant rise” in positive Coronavirus cases within their camp. Fulham requested the Premier League to rearrange the Burnley game, after the latest round of testing revealed a further increase in positive COVID-19 cases. “With the health of players and staff the priority, the League and Fulham will agree a further action plan to control the outbreak to allow the club to resume their season safely,” the Premier League said in a statement. “Players and staff will now be retested as part of a revised testing schedule.” The match becomes the fourth in the Premier League to be postponed because of COVID-19 cases since the start of December, with Manchester City and Newcastle United also called off after multiple positive cases were recorded. Newcastle’s match with Aston Villa, initially set for December 1 was postponed, and City’s visit to Everton on December 30 was also called off.
