The Ekiti State Security Network Agency (Amotekun) has arrested four suspected kidnappers. The gang disclosed that they arrived from Sokoto a few days ago. Ekiti Commander of the Corps, retired Brig. General Joe Komolafe, briefed reporters on Friday in Ado-Ekiti. He said the quartet were arrested Friday morning at Eda Oniyo in Ilejemeje Local Government Area. The suspects are Abubakar Sule, Sheu Usman, Abubakar Babangida and Sheu Mamuda. Amotekun operatives intercepted them as they rode on motorcycles. Items found on them include a long rope. Komolafe said they confessed using it to tie their victims. “They told us they were coming from Ilorin, Kwara, after they arrived from Sokoto in a truck a few days ago. Upon questioning, they said they were heading to Akungba Akoko in Ondo but with no clear mission here. “What we found on them clearly gave them away as suspected kidnappers and also their confession. One of them clearly wrote on his motorcycle in Hausa language, ‘Duniya Ba Hutu’ which means, ‘No Peace in this world’.” Komolafe said none of the motorcycles had a number plate or documents to show ownership. The suspects would be handed over to the police for further investigation.
