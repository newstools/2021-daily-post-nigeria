Bayelsa Governor, Douye Diri, on Sunday, spoke on his emergence as the state’s number one citizen. He told worshippers at St. Peter’s Anglican Church in Sampou, his hometown, that he never knew the community would produce a governor. The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain recalled that he had been supporting the aspiration of others. Diri was former Senator for Bayelsa Central senatorial district. “I did not know that God had destined me to be governor. When your time comes, nobody can stop it. If the same God could do this for me, He will do it for you. Just be faithful, have a free mind,” he said. The governor urged Christians to be faithful to God in order to unlock more earthly blessings. “What can you offer to God other than to say ‘thank you’ to Him? If not for God, I will not be standing here as governor. So we must continue to thank Him with everything we have daily.” Diri added that there had always been divine intervention whenever agents of evil tried to plunge Bayelsa into darkness. The service was attended by members of the state executive council, other appointees, traditional rulers and dignitaries.
