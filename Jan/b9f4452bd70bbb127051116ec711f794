President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday said his administration doesn’t have money to share. He spoke to leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Daura, Katsina State. Buhari called for more participation and ownership of the party at grassroots by adopting bottom-up processes of registration and revalidation at ward, local government, state and federal levels, including the FCT. The President hosted Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, some governors and party members of the APC at his country-home after his registration. “Our party style and structure should no longer be Abuja downwards, but from the ward level upwards. So that people can defend the party and its policies even at every level. “The question of putting hands in pocket to get people to participate is no longer there since we don’t have the money to share.’’ The President said elites in the country should be more reflective and fair in their assessment of the administration, noting that the strides recorded should be appreciated. “I will like our elites to be more reflective and remember when we came in in 2015. Where we were then, the resources available and the infrastructure we met on the ground,” he added.
