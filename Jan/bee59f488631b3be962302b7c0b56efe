Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has remained coy on the club’s pursuit of Real Madrid’s Martin Odegaard. Odegaard is believed to have chosen the Gunners ahead of Real Sociedad and Ajax. However, when asked about an imminent transfer, Arteta whose side lost 1-0 in the FA Cup at Southampton, said: “I don’t know. Since last night I don’t have any news.” Arteta is trying to bring in creativity into his squad this window, following Mesut Ozil’s departure to Fenerbahce. Odegaard, who is unhappy under Zinedine Zidane, has emerged as his top target. The 22-year-old wants to leave the Santiago Bernabeu to get more playing time. Odegaard is unhappy with his lack of minutes under Zidane this season and has asked to leave before the end of the transfer window.
