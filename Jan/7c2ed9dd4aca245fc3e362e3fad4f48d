Rev. William Okoye, General Overseer of the All Christians Fellowship Mission (ACFM) says 2021 may not be better if Nigerians do not turn to God. He said this in his New Year message on Friday in Abuja, NAN reports. The cleric stressed that people needed to start doing things right and be more sincere. “If we do not change from our evil ways, turn to God and start correcting our mistakes, the new year will not be different from the previous year and things may not get better. “Nigerians should repent of their sins and be their neighbours’ keepers for peace to reign in the country. At a time like this, Nigerians must trust in God.” Okoye, however, advised citizens not to be afraid. He said the Lord, who has been with everyone throughout the challenging times, will not leave them. The religious leader emphasised the need for Nigerians to unite and rebuild the country.
