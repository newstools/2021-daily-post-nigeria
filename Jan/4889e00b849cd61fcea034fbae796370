President Muhammadu Buhari has approved N6.45billion for setting up of oxygen plants in 38 locations nationwide to enhance the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This was disclosed at the first National Economic Council (NEC) of 2021 presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. In attendance were Governors, Ministers, Central Bank Governor and other senior government officials. Finance Minister, Zainab Ahmed said the President’s approval for the production of oxygen was necessitated by the increase in coronavirus patients. Health Minister Osagie Ehanire informed the NEC that sequel to Buhari’s decision to activate the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund based on the National Health Act, N55.1billion was approved in 2018 and that 50% of the sum has since been released to the States and the FCT. The Fund was established under Section 11 of the National Health Act (NHA Act), as the principal funding vehicle for the Basic Minimum Package of Health Services (BMPHS). It seeks to increase the fiscal space and overall financing to the health sector to assist Nigeria to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC).
