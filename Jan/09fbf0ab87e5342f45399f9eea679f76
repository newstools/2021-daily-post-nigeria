Popular South Africa jazz trombonist and composer, Jonas Gwangwa, whose music powered the anti-apartheid struggle is dead. President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed his death. Ramaphosa in his tribute to the Oscar nominated 83-year-old artist, described him as “a giant of revolutionary cultural movement. “The trombone that boomed with boldness and bravery, and equally warmed our hearts with mellow melody has lost its life force.” “A giant of revolutionary cultural movement and our democratic creative industries has been called to rest,”President Ramaphosa added. The legendary musician was nominated for an Oscar for the theme song of the 1987 film “Cry Freedom”. “Gwangwa delighted audiences in Sophiatown until it became illegal for black people to congregate and South African musicians were jailed merely for practicing their craft,” the President added. He had a career spanning 40years and was also awarded the Order of Ikhamanga, South Africa’s highest national award presented for achievements in art and culture sometime in 2010.
