Newly appointed Derby County manager, Wayne Rooney, has tipped his former side, Manchester United to win the Premier League title. United went back on top on Wednesday night, after coming from behind to beat Fulham 2-1 at Craven Cottage. The Red Devils last won the title in 2013, when Sir Alex Ferguson was still in charge. Last season, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side finished 33 points behind champions Liverpool. Rooney puts their turn around this season down to the arrival of Bruno Fernandes and Edinson Cavani. “The last few years, Manchester United haven’t been ready to challenge for the title, but now they’ve brought in players like Fernandes and Cavani – players with a winning mentality – that has helped massively,” said Rooney ahead of this weekend’s Sky Bet Championship match at QPR. “And now the squad is challenging for a Premier League title. I said to the coaches in the office here six weeks ago that I thought Manchester United will win the League. I still feel that today. “Paul Pogba will have a massive part to play in that. Those players that have been brought in with winning mentalities will relieve some of the pressure from Paul a bit, and he can now show his quality on the pitch.”
