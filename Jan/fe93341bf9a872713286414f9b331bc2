Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has reacted to the actions of Sunday Igboho against the Fulanis. He said the activist did not ask all Fulanis to leave but those who engage in killings and kidnappings. The former presidential aide lambasted Yoruba leaders for being “timid”. He said if they had taken strong actions against incessant attacks in the region, Igboho would not have a reason to take up the fight. In a statement on Saturday, the government critic warned authorities against actions that may worsen the situation. He noted that it would be dangerous, reckless and counterproductive for President Muhammadu Buhari “to arrest or kill Sunday Igboho”. “When the Northern youths demanded that Igbos should leave the North, no-one was arrested. Why should Sunday be arrested or killed for asking killer Fulani herdsmen to leave South-West?” Fani-Kayode advised the federal government to tread softly, noting that Sunday has the full support of the Yoruba nation and has spoken for the people. “Kill him and you make him a martyr for Oduduwa, arrest him and you make him the greatest hero of the Yoruba since independence. Whichever way he wins. “The way to solve the problem is to arrest the herdsmen that kill and kidnap our people in the SW and not to arrest or kill those that are standing up and speaking for their victims. “Sunday did not ask for all Fulanis to leave South-West. He asked for the killers, terrorists and kidnappers amongst them to leave Ibarapa and the Yoruba people love him for it. Is that a crime? “In 1999 when Gani Adams was rising, I identified him as a young man to watch. I wrote an essay about him and I said his courage would take him far. I was proved right. “Today, I identify Sunday Igboho who has stood up against wickedness, injustice and apartheid in our land when other Yoruba leaders were too timid to stand. I commend his courage.”
