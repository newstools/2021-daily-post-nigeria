US President, Donald Trump will be having his private sendoff party running simultaneously with the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. The outgoing President will depart Washington DC on Wednesday morning before Biden is sworn in. Trump has made it clear he won’t be attending the inauguration of his successor, making him the first modern-day president of the US to do so. He will be at an unprecedented farewell event at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington where Air Force One is kept, according to Reuters. No recent President has had his own send-off ceremony at Andrews during the swearing-in ceremony. Former president George W. Bush attended Barrack Obama’s inauguration before having a military send-off at Andrews. A senior administration official told the newspaper about Trump’s plans. Traditionally, the outgoing President and his wife attend the inauguration of the new president at the Capitol and then flies off in a military helicopter to board a government jet at the air base to take them to their destination. Andrew Johnson was the first President to snub his successor’s inauguration and that was in 1869. Andrew was also impeached.
