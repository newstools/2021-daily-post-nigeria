Chelsea, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are among the six big European clubs currently in a battle to sign Bayern Munich’s David Alaba next summer transfer window. The three other European clubs that want to secure Alaba’s services are Juventus, Liverpool and Inter Milan. This was disclosed by respected sports journalist and transfer expert, Nicolo Schira, via his official Twitter account on Thursday. According to Schira, Alaba’s representatives, headed by Pini Zahavi, has received six bids from the clubs for his client. “Pini Zahavi is on fire for David #Alaba’s future,” Schira wrote on Twitter. “The contract with #BayernMunich expires in June, and he has received bids from 6 European clubs to sign the fullback next summer: #RealMadrid, #PSG, #Chelsea and #Liverpool wants him. From Italy #Inter and #Juventus opened talks.” Alaba’s current contract with Bayern Munich will expire at the end of June 2021. The 28-year-old recently turned down a £200,000 a week contract extension to remain at the Bundesliga champions. The Austrian international was permitted by the Champions League to discuss moves with other clubs, after he turned down the club’s last offer.
