The Kaduna State government has approved January 25 as resumption date for tertiary institutions in the state. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Mrs. Phoebe Yayi, made this known in a statement issued in Kaduna on Sunday. Recall that education stakeholders in the state had proposed Jan. 21 or Jan. 25 for schools’ resumption, subject to the approval of the state government. But, the Ministry of Health, on January 21, recommended the suspension of resumption of schools until readiness assessment for COVID-19 was conducted. Yaya noted that the new approval came after assessing all tertiary institutions in the state to ensure their level of preparedness and plans for reopening. She disclosed that the COVID-19 assessment team confirmed a full compliance with the state’s COVID-19 preventive protocols and for safe learning environment against the pandemic. However, the permanent secretary appealed to managements of all the tertiary institutions to ensure strict adherence to all the guidelines and protocols put in place by the state government. She warned that any lapse or bridge in any institution will result to the closure without notice. “Resumption by all tertiary institutions will be in phases, as provided by the institutions and according to their academic levels and subject to their compliance with the guidelines in place. “Unscheduled monitoring visits to schools across the state will be conducted by the task force team to ensure continuous compliance with the COVID-19 guidelines,” she added. Yaya added that assessment, based on COVID-19 guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health for public and private primary and secondary schools, was ongoing. She said that a decision would be announced immediately the assessment was concluded and recommendations approved.
