The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has warned the All Progressives Congress(APC) not to fight when they have to hand over to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023. Governor Wike also emphasised that Nigerians were earnestly waiting for the PDP to return to power. The governor’s assistant on media,Kelvin Ebiri, disclosed this in a statement after the inauguration of some state projects. He said: “Eleme people, I want to sincerely thank you for the support that you’ve given to me and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “Do not relent. Continue because the hope of this country depends on the PDP.” Wike also advised Ndume and the APC to respect the wishes of Nigerians after the next general elections. “To our special Guest of Honour (Ndume), he should not be angry because we are taking over from them. When they came, we didn’t fight, they took over. “Now that Nigerians have decided to change them, let them also handover to us as quickly as possible without any fight,” Wike said. —
