Private school proprietors in Zamfara State have said they were not aware of plans by the state government to close down their schools, saying that no official communication came from the state government. Alhaji Sama’ila Husaini Moriki, leader of the proprietors disclosed this to newsmen while reacting to allegations that some of the private schools are not up to standard while some have never registered their schools to the appropriate body. “But I want the state government to consider our problems, because we have spent over seven month without schools due to the effect of the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in forgetting payment of second term fees, from the parents. “The state commissioner of Education knows very well that private schools are helping the state government because we have over 500 private schools in the state and we produce intelligent students, “he said.
