Former Arsenal winger, Robert Pires, has said manager Mikel Arteta will turn the team into title contenders. Pires, who played under Arsene Wenger, went further to say the Gunners could even make the top-four this season. Arsenal host Manchester United on Saturday evening and go into the fixture sitting in ninth place with 30 points. “It’s hard but I would not even rule out that they finish in the top four and qualify for the Champions League this year because things change quickly in the league. “If I see Liverpool having tough periods, I’m telling myself there is an opportunity for Arsenal to grab. “They only need to get back to winning ways and then maintain the consistency. Then anything can happen,” Pires said.
