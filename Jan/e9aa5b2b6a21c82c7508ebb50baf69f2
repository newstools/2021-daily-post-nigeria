Presiding Bishop of Christ Life Church worldwide, Francis Wale Oke, has revealed how God killed a UNILAG lecturer who failed his daughter twice because she refused to sleep with him. The clergyman, giving a testimony while preaching in church, said his daughter failed a course for two years in UNILAG because of sexual advances from her lecturer. According to him, the lecturer demanded to sleep with his daughter before she would pass the course which was compulsory for her to move to the next class. In the video, Oke said “One of my daughters while in UNILAG was harassed by a lecturer. A man old enough to be her father but a very wicked and evil man. “He said she would not pass the course unless he sleeps with her but my daughter rejected saying she is a child of God. “The man told her she wouldn’t leave his department and will ensure she fails the course which was compulsory. If you don’t pass, you can’t move to the next year. “He failed my daughter the first time. Not that she failed, he failed her. She tried to pray, fast and nothing changed. She failed the second time and by the rules of the department, she will have to withdraw.” He revealed that his daughter came to him crying about the situation and that was when he prayed to God. Two weeks after he prayed, the UNILAG lecturer had an accident and died. “I stood on my feet after my daughter told me about the lecturer and when I stood on my feet like that, be careful. I said Oh God, judge this matter! I had tears in my eyes. Two years of her precious years have been wasted. “Two weeks later, the evil man (lecturer) with another girl he had been sleeping with, along the Lagos-Ibadan express road had an accident and the two of them died. My God killed them,” Wale Oke added.
