West Ham midfielder, Declan Rice, has told friends he would rather sign for Chelsea than Manchester United, the UK Mirror reports. Since making his first-team debut in 2017, Rice has gone on to make 128 appearances for the Hammers. The 21-year-old’s form saw him called up to the England squad in 2019 and he has gone on to earn 13 caps for his country. United and Chelsea have both expressed interest in signing Rice, who West Ham fear will leave the club in the summer. Rice began his career at Chelsea’s academy, before being released at the age of 16. And he is looking to return to Stamford Bridge if he leaves East London. Rice may feel he has unfinished business at Chelsea and will be tempted to join his best friend and England team-mate Mason Mount in Frank Lampard’s squad. West Ham value Rice at around £80million and may be forced to sell if he pushes for a move.
