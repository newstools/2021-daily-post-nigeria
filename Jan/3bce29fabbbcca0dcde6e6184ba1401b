Real Madrid playmaker, Martin Odegaard, flew into the Luton Airport on Sunday, to complete his loan move to Arsenal, AFCBell reports. Madrid have signed the necessary paperwork and given Odegaard permission to undergo his medicals with the Gunners. Odegaard is set to leave the LaLiga champions, after making only seven league appearances so far. The 22-year-old will join Mikel Arteta’s side until the end of the 2020/2021 season in search of playing time. Arsenal will pay the full amount of Odegaard’s wages during his time at the Emirates. The player earns £38,000-per-week, wages Arsenal will have no problem paying. However, they will pay a loan fee of just £2m to Madrid, meaning they have very little to lose even if Odegaard does not live up to expectations. It is understood both clubs have an agreement to sit down and review the loan deal at the end of the season, although there is no clause inserted to make it a permanent move.
