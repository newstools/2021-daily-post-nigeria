The Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, has aired his opinion on the tension in Oyo State. The monarch appealed to farmers and herders in Ibarapa and Nigeria, in general, to live in peace. He spoke on Saturday at the Royal Festival of Praise organised by the Holy Ghost Royal House of Restoration Church in Ibadan. NAN reports that Olubadan was represented by Mogaji Okiti-Aresa, Chief Adeshina Olatunji. He said blaming a particular ethnic group for insecurity in the country would only further breed disunity in the country and should not be allowed. Adetunji called on Nigerians to support the security agencies in the country in tackling criminal activities and refrain from taking laws into their own hands. Olubadan counselled religious leaders and traditional leaders to complement the government’s efforts by preaching unity in their domains. ”As leaders, it does not mean we are above God, traditional rulers, religious leaders should know that they are not God and we must lead our people in a Godly manner,” he said.
