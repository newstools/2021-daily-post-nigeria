Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, will lead a clampdown on goal celebrations by ordering his players to practise new routines in training. Lampard is ready to ban group hugs in training, in a bid to follow a new Premier League COVID-19 crackdown on celebrations. Premier League bosses are holding meetings with captains, PFA reps and managers to introduce stronger protocols. They will be told to stop mass celebrations while observing social distancing on the pitch. Lampard has confirmed he will have a look at doing a “dry run” on the training pitch ahead of games. “We practise social distancing as much as we can at the training ground. On the pitch it can be difficult at times clearly. “But every moment you possibly can and in training I suppose the instinct of the moment shouldn’t grab you as much. Let’s hope, as it would do in-game when you’re scoring in the Premier League that wins a game or whatever. “So for sure it is something I’ll pass on to the players and you see a lot of these group hugs now when they win a five-a-side so that will be something we will look at,” he said. Chelsea will travel to Fulham in a rescheduled fixture on Saturday.
