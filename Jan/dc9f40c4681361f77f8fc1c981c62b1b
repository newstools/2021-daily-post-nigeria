Olusegun Bamgbose, Esq., National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has described the much publicized vaccination of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo as a great grand deception to entice Nigerians to take the COVID-19 vaccine. According to the senior lawyer, “It’s never safe yet to take the vaccines. They have been told, but pressure is being mounted on them to do it to encourage Nigerians to take it.” Bamgbose, in a chat with DAILY POST on Friday said, “If for any reason they [Buhari and Osinbajo] had the live telecast, it won’t be the vaccine that will be administered on them.” He further warned Nigerians to be careful, adding that it was better for the people to wait for about 6 – 9 months to hear from those that have been vaccinated before trying it. “The truth of the matter remains that it’s not yet very safe for any African to be vaccinated. This is simply because no one can hundred per cent guarantee that the vaccine is well adapted to work maximally if administered on an African. “I believe the Presidency is aware of this medical fact. Nigerians should be wary of being vaccinated for the main time. Nigerians will have to wait for the next 6 to 9 months to medically evaluate the effects on those who are already vaccinated. “The much publicized live telecast vaccination of the Presidency should be taken with a pinch of salt. It’s doubtful if Buhari and Osinbajo will take the COVID-19 vaccine as it has been much advertised. “It could be a ploy to just encourage Nigerians to take it. Caution is the key word here. Considering the new strain of the virus, one wonders how effective the vaccine will be. “One should also think about the side effects. I’ll urge Nigerians to be careful. I seriously doubt if Buhari as a person will subject himself to such a risk.”
