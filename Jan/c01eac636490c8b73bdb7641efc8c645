Food vendors and traders in Borno and Yobe States have lamented the high cost of food items. They stated that rather than reducing food price, the reopening of borders has escalated prices. Others added that aside the border reopening, activities of kidnappers and Boko Haram, as well as the resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic also affected the price of food in the two States. According to traders and food vendors who spoke to DAILY POST correspondent, they observed that, although the whole country is facing hike in the prices of food, the northern part is facing more difficulties. Alhaji Baba Shanga, a business mogul and transporter in Yobe State told our correspondent that the activities of kidnappers in the north west had contributed immensely to the shortage of food stuff in the country, especially in the North. He said most of the people did not also have the opportunity of farming due to the activities of kidnappers and terrorists. Also, Abubakar Idi Damaturu, a farmer said, “Only God knows what is happening this year, we are battling with coronavirus pandemic, kidnappers, activities of Boko Haram/Islamic State For West African Province and now shortage of food stuff.” “If the federal and the state governments didn’t take concrete measures to address this matter, many people will die as a result of hunger, because people don’t have money to purchase the commodities,” he added. He, however, commended the effort of the Nigerian military for carrying out aggressive operations to finally decimate the remnants of the Boko Haram/Islamic State For West African Province and kidnappers. Observation in the markets across the two States, however, shows that a bag of millet sold at N20,000, instead of N15,000, Guinea corn now N17,000, instead of N13,000. White beans now sold for N29,000, while red beans is N30,000, instead of N23,000. Groundnut now sold for N30,000, instead of N25, 000 and a bag of maize now sold at N18,000, instead of N14,000 it sold two weeks ago.
