Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has told his players they will no longer be able to “fake it”. United sit in second place as the New Year begins, three points behind league leaders Liverpool with a game in hand, following a run of nine games unbeaten. The Red Devils go into 2021, with the chance of lifting four trophies. Solskjaer has suggested any player lacking commitment will find themselves out in the cold, regardless of their name or price tag. “We have competition for places, which means you cannot go around and think you can just fake your way being part of this team,” Solskjaer said. “You only deserve to be in a team that you contribute to. “I think everyone has realised they are privileged to be part of Man United, such a fantastic club with a fantastic history. When you’re here, enjoy it as much as you can, and maybe you’ll experience some fantastic times. “You’ve got winners like Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic. They don’t play every single game, but they are so influential in the group and the buildup to games and during games when they’re not playing.”
