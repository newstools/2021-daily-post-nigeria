Shehu Sani, a former Kaduna Central Senator, has reacted to report of Nigeria’s negotiation with China for COVID-19 vaccines. Recall that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government had said Nigeria was in talks with China for the COVID-19 vaccines. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffery Onyeama had disclosed this in Abuja while addressing journalists after a bilateral meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi. Yi, who is also the State Councilor of China, is on a working visit to Nigeria and some other African countries. However, Sani, in a tweet wrote: “We are ordering vaccines from Russia, China and the US; I hope after these combinations, our faces and hairs will still look African.” Meanwhile, Nigeria on Tuesday night recorded a very high number of COVID-19 cases. Statistics by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, said the country recorded 1,354 new COVID-19 infections.
