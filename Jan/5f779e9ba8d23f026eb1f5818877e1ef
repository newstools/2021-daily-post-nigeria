The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described President Muhammadu Buhari’s 2021 New Year address as empty, directionless. PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said Buhari’s address was a confirmation that Nigeria has become “leaderless.” Ologbondiyan lamented that it was appalling that on New Year Day, all Buhari could offer a troubled and frustrated nation was a “regurgitated script full of lame excuses and empty promises that address nothing.” A statement by Ologbondiyan said: “As a President, Buhari has not demonstrated the capacity to play his own part, as he claimed, having failed to find a solution for the security and economic challenges that pervade our nation under his
incompetent and lethargic watch. “The myriads of lame excuses in Mr. President’s address again underlines our national misfortune of weak leadership that is unable to resolutely confront and vanquish bandits, terrorists, kidnappers and vandals who are now holding our nation hostage, ravaging our communities, kidnapping and beheading our compatriots without restrain. “The least Nigerians expected from Mr. President, in the New Year, was a decisive will to tackle our security challenges by reviewing his parade and heeding the demands by Nigerians to rejig our nation’s security architecture.”
