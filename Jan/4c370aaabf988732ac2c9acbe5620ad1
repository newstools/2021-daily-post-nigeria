Nigerian heavyweight contender, Raphael Akpejiori, has told Tyson Fury to use him as his sparring partner in his (Fury) preparation for the world title fight against Anthony Joshua. Akpejiori said his “devastating” power would make him an ideal sparring partner for Fury. The Nigerian Akpejiori, who is set to fight Joshua Tuani in Miami on Saturday, has before now knocked out all eight of his opponents. Fury is currently in Florida resort, where he is preparing for the fight against Anthony Joshua and Akpejiori who also trains at the resort believes he and gym-mate Christian Thun can help Fury prepare for Joshua’s concussive punches. “Right now Miami is a hotbed for heavyweight boxing training,” Akpejiori told Sky Sports. “We have Christian here. We have Ivan Dychko here. At some point, we had Bakhodir Jalolov here. We had Filip Hrgovic here, Cassius Chaney here. “If he wants to come to Miami to spar, he is guaranteed to have high-quality sparring. It would be a great place for him. “If he wants to fight someone with devastating knockout power and he wants to prep for that, then he is going to have to come spar with me and with Christian, or the other heavyweights that are here. Especially me. “It’s a great place for him, he should consider it.” In his last fight, Joshua beat his mandatory challenger, Kubrat Pulev, in the ninth round to retain his three WHC belts. Eddie Hearn, Joshua’s promoter had recently said that a deal for his client to fight WBC champion, Tyson Fury in an undisputed world heavyweight title bout this year is all but done.
