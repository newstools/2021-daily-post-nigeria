Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, AAUA, has been shut down indefinitely. The indefinite closure of the school was coming about 24 hours after an accident caused by a truck belonging to Dangote Group claimed the lives of some students of the institution. DAILY POST had reported that about 12 persons were feared killed when a Dangote truck loaded with bags of cement crushed passersby, students and traders before ramming into shops opposite the university after it suffered break failure in Akungba-Akoko, Akoko South West Local Government area of Ondo State. It was gathered that the move by the institution to shut down the school was due to the rising tension among students as well as indigenes of the community over the allegation that the government has failed to find lasting solutions to the incessant road crashes which had claimed lots of lives in the community. In a circular signed by the Acting Registrar of the institution, Opeoluwa Akinfemiwa, students of the institutions were directed to leave the school premises by 6:00 pm on Sunday. The circular read “Further to our circular of Saturday 23rd January, 2021 and the attendant protest by students on Sunday, 24th January, 2021, the Acting Vice Chancellor, Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko, Prof Olugbenga Ige, on behalf of Senate, has directed that the University be closed with immediate effect until further notice. “All students are therefore advised to vacate the campus latest by 6pm today, Sunday 24th January, 2021.” Meanwhile some irate youths in the community had on Sunday prevented a government delegation from entering the community.
