Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has declared his support for the Abia Governor’s Cup. He said his administration will enter into partnership as a government with the private sector especially those with a track record for supporting such sporting ventures. The governor made this known in a statement released via his Twitter account on Friday. He said that Abia being the only state in Nigeria with two Premier League teams should be the repository of young upcoming football stars. “It was refreshing to watch the culmination of our efforts to restore our past glory in the area of grassroots sports promotion in Abia through our novel Governor’s Cup competition which kicked off in December 2020. “Abia being the only state in Nigeria with two Premier League teams should rightfully be the repository of young and upcoming football stars from which Nigeria and the rest of the world can tap. “Even though my local government lost out early in the competition, Abia State, my Abia, your Abia, our Abia won; the youth won. “All those football scouts from Nigeria and beyond will certainly have a good harvest of young talents from this grassroots competition. “However, because of its benefits to our youths in particular & Nigeria as a whole, I commit to ensure the sustainability of the competition by entering into partnership as a government with the private sector especially those with a track record for supporting such sporting ventures. “The next edition of Abia Governor’s Cup is already loading! It has come to stay,” he said.
