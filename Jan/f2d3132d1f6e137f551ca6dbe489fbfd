The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has said the Third Mainland Bridge would be reopened on February 15. Fashola disclosed this on Thursday, during the inspection of construction work on major roads and bridges in Lagos State. The Minister noted that after the Third Mainland Bridge is reopened, work would begin on the Falomo Bridge. The Third Mainland Bridge was partially shut on July 24, 2020 for rehabilitation works expected to last for six months. But Fashola has explained that the End SARS protest caused the extension of the completion date. He said, “On the Third Mainland Bridge most of our work is almost done, we lost two weeks during the civil protest and our completion date earlier was towards the end of January, which has slipped. “We are hoping that by 15th of February we should be done and the bridge should be opened to the public. “That is one of the reasons why I also came to see how far and when this bridge will be opened to the public because this is delaying our work on Falomo Bridge.”
