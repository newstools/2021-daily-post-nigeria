The Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has affirmed that the people of the state cannot continue to live in fear occurring from kidnapping and crimes in the state. Akeredolu disclosed this while receiving AIG Isaac Akinmoyede, the newly posted Assistant Inspection-General of Police for Zone 17, headquartered in Akure, and Brig. Gen. Raymond Utsaha, the new Brigade Commander of the 32 Artillery, Owena Cantonment in the state. The governor advised the new AIG and Brigade Commander to collaborate with other security agencies in Ondo for optimal performance, assuring them of a good working relationship as extended to their predecessors in office. Akeredolu said, “Insecurity can be tackled in a different way when there are collaborative efforts. “We have great challenges. We need all hands on deck. Our challenges are enormous. Top of it is the issue of kidnapping. “We cannot continue to live in fears. It’s our constitutional responsibility as governor and as police to prevent crimes and guarantee the security of lives and property of our people.” Akeredolu also thanked the police for the measure of cooperation given to the state security network, Amotekun Corps.
