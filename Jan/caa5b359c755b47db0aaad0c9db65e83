Tottenham Hotspur, Jose Mourinho, has claimed he is treated worse than other Premier League managers, when it comes to being punished for touchline behaviour. Mourinho stated this while speaking to the media, ahead of his side’s Premier League clash against Liverpool. It is a rematch of last month’s fixture that saw the Reds win 2-1. After that match, Mourinho hit out at Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, saying he would be sent off if he behaved the same way the Liverpool manager did on the touchline. Mourinho continued to suggest there was a double standard at play ahead of Thursday’s game, insisting other managers are treated better than him. “What I can say is when I didn’t behave well I paid the price,” Mourinho said. “And I paid the price in two ways: one was to see matches on TV in the dressing room and another price was big-money fines and I feel that, for some of the other guys, it doesn’t happen the same. It doesn’t happen the same with them. “But, if the referee and the fourth official are there to do that job, I just hope they do that job and act the way they have to act.”
