Agbado Oke-Odo Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Lagos State, has shut Bola Ahmed Tinubu (BAT) Health Centre in Aboru, to curb the spread of coronavirus. David Famuyiwa, the LCDA Chairman, recently ordered the closure of Meiran Primary Health Care (PHC) after a staff member tested positive to the virus. In a statement on Tuesday, Famuyiwa said he directed the closure of BAT Health Centre main building after inspecting some health facilities within the council. However, the fumigated premises would be open for patients. Famuyiwa assured that COVID-19 testing will continue in the facility to ascertain their condition before medical attention. He confirmed that fumigation had commenced at the PHC in Meiran. “We will ensure that all other centres are also fumigated to prevent the spread of the pandemic within the LCDA,” NAN quoted him as saying. “I am glad to inform you that the nurses in good health conditions will immunise babies on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday at the open ground opposite the Meiran PHC.” Famuyiwa advised nursing mothers to adhere strictly to COVID-19 protocols during and after the exercise.
