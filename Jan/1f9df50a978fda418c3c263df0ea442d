Larry King’s estranged wife, Shawn Southwick King has revealed the cause of his death. The TV icon was reported dead last Saturday after testing positive for COVID-19. However, his estranged wife in an interview with Entertainment Tonight, said Larry King died of sepsis, not coronavirus. She said: “It was an infection, it was sepsis that killed King. “His sweet little body was just been hit so many times with so many things and once we heard the word Coronavirus , all of our hearts just sank.” She added that though Larry King beat COVID-19, it had taken a toll on his health. “But he beat it, but it did take its toll and then the unrelated infection finally is what took him, but Larry was not going to go down easily,” she said. Shawn, who got married to King from 1997 until 2019, disclosed she spokewith Larry, the father of her sons, Chance and Cannon, on video call before his death. According to her, Larry’s last message to her was , ‘I love you, take care of the boys’.” Shawn was King’s seventh wife and was in the midst of a divorce at the time of his death.
