Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, has welcomed efforts by a team of Nigerian professors and scientists investigating the effectiveness and roles some drugs can play in the treatment of COVID-19. Osinbajo’s spokesman, Laolu Akande, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday. Osinbajo, who was briefed on the report yesterday by a team of scientists led by Prof. Femi Babalola, the Principal investigator, and Prof. Chris Bode, the Chief Medical Director of LUTH, expressed happiness that Nigeria and Nigerians “are at the cutting edge of scientific research into the COVID-19 treatment.” The vice president said, “We have an opportunity here, and I’m so fascinated to hear this drug in question has been used in the treatment of River Blindness in this country.” Osinbajo also said with the report, Nigeria is at an advantage both in knowledge and availability of the drug, particularly since Ivermectin has been found useful not only in the treatment of Coronavirus but also as a prophylactic medication. Osinbajo disclosed that the Federal Government of Nigeria would explore further ways to support the research for the benefit of Nigerians and humanity generally, while also advancing the effective funding of scientific research in the country.
