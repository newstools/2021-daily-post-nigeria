Arsenal are keen on a move for Barcelona goalkeeper, Neto, according to Sky Sports. The Gunners are looking to sign a goalkeeper as replacement for Runar Alex Runarsson, who has struggled since joining last summer. Arsenal are hoping to land Neto in a loan deal this month, with an option to purchase in the summer. Earlier this week, Mikel Arteta admitted the club needed a new keeper. “We are assessing the situation with the three positions on the goalkeeping area and we will find a different solution, probably in this window,” Arteta had said. The Gunners brought in Runarsson from Dijon in the summer, after Emi Martinez left for Aston Villa. It is understood Runarsson was never Arsenal’s top target and was always seen as a third-choice keeper.
