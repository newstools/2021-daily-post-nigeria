President Muhammadu Buhari-led government has said more than 7 million Nigerians are beneficiaries of the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT). Sadiya Umar Farouq, Minister of Humanitarian Affairs said this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. The programme is under the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP). Farouq accused “unpatriotic persons” of trying to give it a bad name and image. The official explained that the CCT releases a monthly stipend of N5,000 to the poorest and most vulnerable Nigerian households, mostly in the rural communities. She said as at December 2020, the programme operated in 33 states of the country and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). “A total of 1,414,983 beneficiaries with 7,068,629 individual household member beneficiaries have been enrolled, covering 487 Local Government Areas, 4,716 Wards and 37,628 Communities.” Farouq noted that the programme targets to cover all states of the federation by March 2021. “The programme has a clearly defined implementation structure with an electronic base beneficiary enrolment system that focuses on the Poor and Vulnerable Households (PVHHs) culled from the National Social Register.” For those insisting that the programme was enmeshed in corruption, the minister advised them to visit the National Social Safety Net Project’s website for more information.
