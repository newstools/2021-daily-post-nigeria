The Defence Headquarters (DHQ), has denied media reports that Boko Haram terrorists overran a military base in Marte Local Government Area (LGA), of Borno between Jan. 15 and Jan. 16. Maj.-Gen. John Enenche, Coordinator Defence Media Operations, said this on Thursday while giving an update on military operations in the last one week. There were reports that the Boko Haram/Islamic West Africa
Province (ISWAP) terrorists, attacked troops and took over the base at the outskirts of Marte. Enenche denying the report said the terrorists attacked but were repelled. The troops eliminated a number of them and destroyed 13 gun trucks belonging to the terrorists. He said “The story going around that the military base (at Marte) was taken over is not true. The attackers came in through one of the checkpoints at a filling station. “When they came to that checkpoint to attack, the troops there had to do what we call tactical withdrawal. “That tactical withdrawal is to move away so that they (terrorists) can now go into the killing ground. “At times, we have to pull out and draw them into the killing ground, that is what we did and it achieved result. When you do tactical withdrawal, you then call for air support.” Enenche added that the capabilities of the insurgents in the North East were being degraded as they no longer had freedom of action within the theatre of operation.
