A former Liverpool defender, Steve Nicol, has predicted that neither Manchester United nor Jurgen Klopp’s side will both win their Premier League and FA Cup clashes this month. Liverpool and Man United will meet this weekend in the Premier League and then will do battle again a week later in the FA Cup fourth round. But Nicol believes that no side will leave both games with two wins because of how close together the fixtures are. Liverpool presently leads the Premier League table with goal difference but Man United will go into Sunday’s meeting on top of the table if they avoid defeat against Burnley on Tuesday night at Turf Moor. “Well, the only thing I can tell you is that it is extremely unusual that one team wins both,” Nicol told ESPN. “Having been in that situation in many, many situations – depending on the result of the first one, the other one goes completely different. “I guess if you are Liverpool: do you want to win the FA Cup game or do you want to win the Premier League game? It is the same question for Manchester United. “When you go into it, you will think, “Oh right, we will win both”. But as I said, experience tells me and being involved in it many, many times no one team wins both. “I guess if you ask both of these sides, which one do you want to win. I suggest that both will say the Premier League game.”
