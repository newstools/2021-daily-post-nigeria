Former Ogun State Governor, Sen. Ibikunle Amosun and a governorship candidate, Hon. Adekunle Akinlade has sympathised with the family of a late Nigerian former Minister, Sen Jubril Martins-Kuye, who passed on Sunday. Amosun and Akinlade, in separate statements, said the late politician left large footprints in the sands of time. According to a statement made available to DAILY POST in Abeokuta, Amosun described Martins Kuye as a consummate politician, humanist bridgebuilder. Amosun said, “My family and entire stakeholders of the Ogun Central Senatorial District mourn the death, early today, of our leader and political mentor, Senator Jubril Martins Kuye. The Ogun Senator stated that his death has further depleted the number of truly committed Nigerian patriots whose experience and dedication are needed at this critical time. However, Amosun said he takes solace in the fact that the octogenarian lived a life worthy of emulation. “Our sincere condolences to his wife, children and extended families; our people in Ago Iwoye; Ogun State stakeholders as a whole, and all loved ones left behind. We beseech Almighty Allah, swt, to forgive his sins and reward him with Aljanah Firdaus,” he said. Likewise, Akinlade, in a statement by his media aide, Azeez Adelani, expressed a deep sense of shock and immense sadness over Martins Kuye’s death, saying he died at a time his wealth of experience is being sought after. In his words, Akinlade mentioned that Kuye was a grass root politician, scholar and community builder, whose immense devotion, according to him, has contributed to the socio-political stability of his home town – Ago-Iwoye and Nigeria. “While he will be dearly missed, I implore the Almighty God to accept his return, grant him eternal rest and give his family, friends and Nigerians the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss,” Akinlade prayed.
