The Adamawa State Police Command is investigating the sponsors of a beach party allegedly scheduled for the Adamawa State capital, Yola. The party was said to have been planned for Sunday, January 3rd but the police blocked it, citing the possibility of a show of nudity that may offend public sensibilities. Publicity for the Yola beach party had circulated on social media, inviting adults only and charging N2,000 as gate fee. The notice did not state the venue of the planned party because although Yola has a major river, the River Benue, there is no established beach platform that could be a likely venue for the said party. The Police Public Relations Officer in Adamawa State, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, said in a statement that the Commissioner of Police had ordered an investigation into the aborted beach party, including the identity and details of its sponsors. “Anyone found involved will be arrested and possibly prosecuted. The Commissioner of Police has ordered an investigation to unravel the sponsors and venue of the said beach party. The command will not allow any immoral activity that could cause public outrage,” the police image maker said.
