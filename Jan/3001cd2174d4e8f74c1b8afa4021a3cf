Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President, Goodluck Jonathan, has backed the quit notice issued to Fulani herdsmen by Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State. Omokri said Akeredolu has the right and power to issue the quit notice order to protect his people. Akeredolu had issued an ultimatum to Fulani herdsmen to vacate Ondo forest reserves. The Governor had said all unregistered herders should vacate the state’s forest reserves. But the presidency had condemned the ultimatum issued by Akeredolu. President Muhammadu Buhari’s spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu had also called for restraint. However, Omokri in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Wednesday morning also advised Shehu. He tweeted: “@RotimiAkeredolu, we are fully behind you in your decision to take on the Federal Government in this matter of herdsmen troubling your state. “You have the right and the power. Protect your people and let that AGIP creature, @GarShehu, go to a very hot place!”
