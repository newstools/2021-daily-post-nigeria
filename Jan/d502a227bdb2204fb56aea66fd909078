Popular Nigerian singer, Omawumi Megbele, popularly known as Omawonder, has made clarifications on her pregnancy rumour. The rumour started after the music star posted a picture on her Instagram page where she was seen wearing a swimsuit. In the post, her belly looked slightly protruded which had her fans and Nigerians speculating she was pregnant. The mother of two has, however, denied the rumour on her Instagram page. She explained that the protruded stomach was ‘because of ‘Eba and Starch’. Her post read: “It is a beautiful day and the sunshine is just right. Dear womb watchers, nothing they happen, na just Eba and Starch dey show themselves.”
