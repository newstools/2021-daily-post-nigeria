65 primary school teachers who were allegedly recruited illegally have been sacked in Kaduna State. Mr Tandat Katuma, Auditor of the Kaduna State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Auditor, confirmed the development on Friday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the council Chairman, Mr Charles Danladi, who announced the sack of the teachers on Wednesday alleged that the anomaly was detected through the over-bloated wage bill of the teachers, which kept increasing every month without new employment. He further stated that 16 out of the 65 were among the primary school teachers that failed the competency test but were illegally reappointed while the remaining 51 were illegally recruited during the first and second batches of the recruitment of 25,000 qualified teachers. Danladi added that SUBEB official involved in the illegal recruitment exercise had been sanctioned.
