The Premier League is trying to curb the spread of COVID-19 among players and staff, by introducing an “enhanced” set of measures. In a letter sent out on Friday, the 20 clubs were warned to adhere or risk the possibility of punishment. First of all, players have been instructed not to hug or shake hands. Swapping of shirts has also been banned. However, the measures will not be officially brought in until the next Premier League shareholders’ meeting, but clubs have been instructed to start following them straight away. Players must now wear face masks always unless they are playing during the match, warming up or giving interviews. Guests in matchday directors’ boxes are now also limited to 10-per-team. Travel restrictions have become stricter, too, with clubs needing to use three coaches to travel anywhere, to ensure social distancing is respected. In the latest week of testing in the Premier League, there was a season-high return of 40 positive coronavirus tests.
