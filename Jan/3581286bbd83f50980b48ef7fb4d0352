Clubs in Qatar and Saudi Arabia have shown interest in Manchester United loanee, Odion Ighalo as his stay at Manchester United comes to an end on January 31. Also, two unnamed Premier League clubs have also made tentative enquiries about the former Nigerian international. The former Watford striker moved to Old Trafford in January from Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua, initially until May 31 but had his loan extended in June after scoring five goals last season. However, the arrival of Uruguayan Edinson Cavani has limited his opportunities and his now attracting interest from clubs around the world. Ighalo’s five goals for United came in 20 appearances since arriving at Old Trafford on Deadline Day in January 2020. Ighalo’s contract with Shanghai Shenhua runs until December 31 and the Chinese Super League side expect him to return at the end of his loan in England. Ighalo has not started a league game for United and made just four appearances for the Red Devils this season.
