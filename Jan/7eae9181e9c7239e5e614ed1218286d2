Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has compared American business magnate, Bill Gates to the biblical John the Baptist. He accused the Microsoft co-founder of just preparing the way for Antichrist. Gates had last week said he was yet to understand why COVID-19 cases and fatalities still remain low in Africa. But while addressing his members in his church in Akure, Giwa said the agents of Lucifer are working tirelessly to weaken the church. He said, “Just like John the Baptist who prepared the way for our Lord Jesus Christ so also Bill gates is preparing the way for Antichrist. “They are working tirelessly to frustrate the children of God from gathering and praying to Jehovah. It’s just unfortunate that the church is now being surrounded by ministers who have little faith. “They serve God with their lips but their hearts are far away from God. If not, they wouldn’t have succumbed to pressure by the government that does not know God. “Many of you read that a Tanzanian president refused to close churches during the outbreak of coronavirus in March. “Those who are trying to frustrate our lives shall gather to scatter, except God allows their plans to stand. “They are curiously waiting for January 20 before they begin their operation fully, but God is greater than whatever plans they have against humanity.”
