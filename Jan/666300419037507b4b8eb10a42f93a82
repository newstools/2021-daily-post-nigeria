Arsenal have opened the door for the exit of Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shkodran Mustafi during the January transfer window. Sokratis, however, looks likely to be the first to leave with two options available to him. Manager Mikel Arteta wants a number of players contributing very little at the moment to move elsewhere before the transfer window closes. The Gunners have already let Sead Kolasinac and William Saliba leave on loan and two more defenders could follow. Sokratisâ€™ former club, Genoa and Turkish side Fenerbahce are interested in a deal for the Greek centre-back. But Sky Sports reports that the 32-year-old is waiting on an offer from Turkish giants Fenerbahce before deciding between the two clubs. Sokratis and Mustafi have fallen down the pecking order at the Emirates and the latter has made just three Premier League appearances this season. Mustafi and Sokratis are out of contract at the end of the season, the North London side will be keen to receive any transfer fee that they can while still possible.
