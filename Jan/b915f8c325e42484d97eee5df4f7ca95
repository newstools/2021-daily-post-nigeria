Mesut Ozil will take a pay cut to sign for Fenerbahce, the UK Mirror reports. The 32-year-old has already reached an agreement with Arsenal to terminate his £350,000-a-week deal. Ozil has now said goodbye to his Gunners’ teammates on Sunday at the club’s London Colney training base. At Fenerbahce, he will earn £3.5m-a-year, which is just over £65,000-a-week. Ozil will, however, get a massive £4.5m bonus for simply joining the Super Lig outfit. That will be spread across three years. The German playmaker will pocket £445,000 if he can inspire the Turkish side to the title, which would be their first for seven years.
