Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has said that the dissolution of the State Executive Council does not affect the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Barr Uche Ihediwa, Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi Kalu, and the Commissioner for Health, Dr Joe Osuji. Recall that Ikpeazu had approved the immediate dissolution of the State Executive Council on a Saturday. He had also ordered all those affected by the dissolution to hand over all government property in their possession as well their handover notes to their respective permanent secretaries. The Governor also approved the recall from suspension of his Chief of Staff, Dr. Anthony Agbazuere. However, another statement by the Secretary to the State Government, Barr Chris Ezem said the earlier announced dissolution of the State Executive Council, exempts the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Barr Uche Ihediwa, Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi Kalu, and the Commissioner for Health, Dr Joe Osuji. He said, “They are to continue performing the duties of their offices along with the Secretary to the State Government, Barr Chris Ezem.”
