Elections to decide Barcelona’s new president have been postponed because of COVID-19. Barcelona made the announcement in a statement on Friday. Barcelona’s supporters were due to vote on a new president on January 24 but the Catalan club has now issued a statement today to confirm it wouldn’t take place on that date. “Due to the mobility restrictions decreed by the (regional) government in the current context of the pandemic, the date of the elections must be delayed,” Barcelona’s statement read. Movement between municipalities is presently restricted in Catalonia up to January 24. Temporary president, Carles Tusquets, will now meet with the three presidential candidates Joan Laporta, Victor Font and Toni Freixa to discuss a new date. The meeting will also decide whether the La Liga giants should move in the ongoing transfer market. Barcelona is interested in signing Manchester City defender, Eric Garcia, but transfers are beyond the merit of Tusquets and he will need permission from all candidates to proceed.
