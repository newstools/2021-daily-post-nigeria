United States President, Donald Trump, on Sunday, said the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States was exaggerated. Trump who made the claim in a tweet on Sunday said the numbers were exaggerated due to the “ridiculous method of determination” by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “The number of cases and deaths of the China Virus is far exaggerated in the United States because of @CDCgov’s ridiculous method of determination compared to other countries, many of whom report, purposely, very inaccurately and low. “‘When in doubt, call it COVID Fake News!”, the tweet reads. According to John Hopkins University, the country’s COVID-19 cases had topped 20.4 million with 350,775 deaths.
