The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has condoled with Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on the loss of his Special Adviser on infrastructure, Mr James Adepoju. The party, in a statement by Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, its National Publicity Secretary, in Abuja on Friday, said it was saddened over Adepoju’s death. Ologbondiyan described Adepoju as a loyal, energetic and dedicated aide, who was playing a pivotal role in Makinde’s accomplishments in infrastructural development in Oyo. He said that the PDP was grieved, but it took solace in God’s promise regarding those who departed in good works. “The PDP commiserates with Makinde, the Adepoju family as well as the government and people of Oyo state and beseech God to grant all the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss,” Ologbondiyan said.
