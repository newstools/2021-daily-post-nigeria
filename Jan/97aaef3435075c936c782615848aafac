The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Tuesday, ordered doctors to consider malaria-like symptoms as COVID-19 infection unless proven. Sanwo-Olu urged residents with such symptoms to visit any public health facility or laboratory get tested for free. He spoke at a press briefing on COVID-19 at the Lagos House, Ikeja. Sanwo-Olu expressed concern about the surging cases of the pandemic. He confirmed the reopening of the INDO Isolation Centre and Gbagada Isolation Center. Sanwo-Olu said over the last few weeks, the demand for oxygen has risen from 70 six-litre cylinders per day to 350 six-litre cylinders at the Yaba Mainland Hospital. This will more than double to 750 six-cylinders before the end of January 2021, the governor projected. “ln addition to providing oxygen at our isolation centres, the government has decentralized the availability of oxygen through the provision of 10 oxygen and sampling kiosks. Oxygen therapy and other related services will be provided to patients that require them”, he said.
