Residents in Kafanchan, on Monday, staged a protest over electricity tariff hike and epileptic power supply in the area. The protesters, who were mainly youths, invaded the Kafanchan Electricity Business Unit, with placards with the inscriptions such as; “Stop charging us high”, “We need constant light,” “Stop the blackout and more others.” According to an eyewitness, Noah Ransom, a student of Senior Government Secondary School Takau was shot at the back and was rushed to Sir Patrick Ibrahim Memorial hospital for medical attention. Some of the angry protesters lamented that the electricity tariff hike and epileptic power supply informed their decision to stage the peaceful protest. They further explained that residents of Kafanchan enjoyed constant light under the former management but wondered why power supply has become epileptic and tariff hiked immediately under the new management. The youths also demanded the removal of the present manager and review the arbitrary increase in electricity tariff in the area. Meanwhile, as of the time of filing this report the security were still battling to disperse the angry youths who are demanding justice for the victim. When contacted, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Mohammed Jalige, said he was not aware of the development, but promised to get back once he’s briefed.
