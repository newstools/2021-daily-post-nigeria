Michael Owen, a former Real Madrid and Liverpool striker, has predicted Chelsea to beat Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday evening. Owen also backed Arsenal to defeat West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday night. According to him, Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur will take all three points against Leeds United on Saturday afternoon. “The Christmas period has not been kind to Chelsea, having won just 1 of their last six matches,” Owen told BetVictor. “These are the types of matches Chelsea seems to thrive in, and with [Manchester] City not at full strength, I could see the Blues’ nicking it in an entertaining match. Chelsea 2, Man City 1.” Speaking on the West Brom vs Arsenal match, Owen said, “Arsenal travel to West Brom with their tails up after back to back wins. “The Hawthorns has not been a happy hunting ground for Arsenal recently. They have failed to win on their last three trips there. However, anything other than three points on this occasion would be a big disappointment for Mikel Arteta. “West Brom got a great result when drawing 1-1 at Anfield, but it has been at home where they have struggled most. I am expecting Arsenal to continue their good run and come away with all 3 points again.” On the Tottenham vs Leeds game, Owen said, “It is now four games without a win for Spurs. Jose Mourinho’s men suffered a late heartache against Wolves on Sunday and must get back on track here against Leeds. “Marcelo Bielsa’s side have been a hard team to get a handle on this season. I reckon they’ll cause Spurs some problems but considering that they’ve lost half of their away games in the league, I think Spurs may just have too much here. Tottenham 3, Leeds 1.” The kick-off time for Chelsea vs Man City is 5:30 pm, while that of West Brom vs Arsenal is 9 pm and Tottenham vs Leeds United is 1:30 pm.
