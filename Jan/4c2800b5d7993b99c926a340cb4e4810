The Ogun State Police Command has arrested three suspected armed robbers. The Police said the suspects had come from Lagos State to carry out a robbery operation in Ogun. The three men were identified as Samuel Sunday, 20, a resident of Fagba, Lagos; Adeleke Mustapha, 22, a resident of Ajala area of Lagos and 19-year-old Joel Rotimi, a resident of Taju Bello street Agbado, Ogun State. They were reportedly arrested following a distress call received by the police in Ajuwon from residents of Iju Isaga area at about 1:45am of the said day. The residents had informed the police that armed hoodlums, numbering about six had invaded the area, dispossessing residents of their valuables. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST that the DPO Ajuwon, SP Andrew Akinseye, “led his men to the area where, some of the hoodlums, who took to their heels on sighting policemen were chased and apprehended.” A cut-to-size locally made pistol, four Bajaj motorcycles, weeds suspected to be India hemp, two voter cards and two National Identity cards were among the items recovered from the suspects.
