Gal Pissetzky and Vicki Podberesky, the two US lawyers who were representing Nigerian Instagram celebrity, Ramon Abbas, better known as Hushpuppi, have applied to withdraw from the case. They have both filed an application at the United States District Court in California, stating their intent. The application was submitted on January 21 and the court will hear it on February 22. The lawyers cited communication problems as the reason for the withdrawal and also that Hushpuppi has hired new lawyers to defend him. “Both family and jail staff have told me that they have conveyed my messages to Mr Abbas to call me. He informed me that he is retaining new counsel. “I informed him that I and Ms. Podberesky were moving to withdraw given his refusal to communicate and cooperate with us,” Pissetzky said. Hushpuppi is being tried on a four-count charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity, money laundering conspiracies and international money laundering. The trial is scheduled to continue on May 4, 2021.
