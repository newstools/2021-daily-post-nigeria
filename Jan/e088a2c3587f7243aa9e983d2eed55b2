A Coalition of Peoples Democratic Party Youth Groups (CPYG) in Ogun State has warned former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose to steer clear of politics in the state. The group also told him to watch his actions and comments in South-West PDP. In a statement on Friday by the Coordinator, CPYG threatened to declare party chieftain persona-non grata. “We say this without prejudice to Fayose’s rights to take political apprenticeship in a drunken spoilt brat, but any attempt to foist such on the good people of Ogun will be highly resisted. “Fayose needs to know that Ogun is not Ekiti and we have managed our uniqueness and peculiarities in a lot of ways over the years even long before Ekiti was carved out of the old Ondo State. “We wonder where Fayose derives his authority to want to lord it over South-West people. We consider it an insult for such a garrulous person to try to put himself in a position of eminence over those who are better than him in all ramifications.” They mocked the former governor for parading himself as a leader of PDP South-West. “We consider this a great insult to the sensibilities of well meaning people of the South-West”, the statement read. CPYG stressed that the Yoruba culture and ethos was founded on the Principle of Omoluwabi, noting Fayose lacks all the tenets. The youths urged party leaders to rein in Fayose “before he destroys everything left of the integrity of PDP in the region.”
