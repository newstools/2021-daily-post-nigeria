Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said he had to calm his players down at half-time against Burnley, after two VAR decisions went against them. United eventually went on to win 1-0 at Turf Moor, thanks to Paul Pogba’s fine volley. The result sends them three points clear at the top of the Premier League. The hosts could have been one man down in the first half, after Robbie Brady appeared to deny Edinson Cavani a clear goalscoring opportunity. But after a VAR pitch-side review, referee Kevin Friend disregarded Brady’s foul entirely and instead booked United defender Luke Shaw for an earlier challenge. United captain, Harry Maguire, then saw his header ruled out due to a controversial foul during his leap. Solskjaer revealed his players were upset with Friend’s decisions and needed to be calmed at the break. “You’ve got to calm them down at half-time because emotions are running high because they disagree with the things that happen out there,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports. “So we have to take back control and we played really well in the second half and we held out at the end.”
