Yobe State Government has concluded arrangements to disburse a total sum of N75m to 1,500 returnee women who were earlier displaced by the activities of Boko Haram insurgents in the state. Executive Secretary Yobe State Emergency Agency, (SEMA), Dr. Mohammed Goje disclosed this to DAILY POST on Wednesday in Damaturu. He said, “Each prospective beneficiary would get N50,000 as financial backing to start up a micro-business or expand the existing one”. He added that disbursement, which will be carried out by Yobe State Emergency Management Agency (YOSEMA) would be executed by the state-owned Micro Finance Bank. According to Dr. Goje, the need for the disbursement is to spur micro economic growth and stability, especially when the nation’s micro businesses are becoming more fragile due to financial burden ensuing from the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the economy; which women are mostly at the receiving end. The SEMA ES also described the initiative “as the foresight of the governor and we are appealing to prospective beneficiaries to make productive usage of the funds when given”. It is the latest social intervention programme by Mai Mala Buni’s administration designed to contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction in the state and by extension complement similar Federal Government’s interventions to citizens.
