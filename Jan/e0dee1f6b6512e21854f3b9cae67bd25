Arsenal Captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has disclosed that a health issue for his mother, is behind his absence from the team. Aubameyang has sat out the last two games – a 1-0 FA Cup defeat at Southampton and a 3-1 Premier League win away to Saint – due to ongoing family reasons. The Gabon international has now confirmed on social media the reason why he has not been involved. Aubameyang wrote on Twitter: “Hey guys, thank you so much for all the messages and calls over the last few days. “My mother is going through some health issues and I had to be there for her. She’s already much better now and I will be back home tonight. I’m more than grateful to the doctors and nurses helping her get through this, and of course, thanks to my Arsenal fam for the love yesterday! I’m more determined than ever to keep our momentum going! “Thank you all again – I really am beyond blessed to receive this level of support and love from all of you and I can’t wait to be back.” It remains unclear if he will feature when Arsenal host Manchester United on Saturday.
