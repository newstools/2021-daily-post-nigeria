President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed his sadness over the death of Hajiya Fatima (Fanta) Garba Mohammed, the immediate younger sister of late military Head of State General Sani Abacha. In a statement by Buhariâ€™s Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the president condoled with the Abacha family. Hajia Fanta is the mother of Senator Basheer Mohammed (Lado), Federal Commissioner, National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). Buhari also said he sympathises with Lado and his siblings as well as the people of Kano State, noting that Hajia Fanta devoted her time on earth to care for the less-privileged and godly upbringing of her children. President Buhari prayed that Allah will console all those who mourn and grant Hajiya Fanta Aljannatul Firdaus. She was aged 75.
