The Premier League have confirmed 40 positive COVID-19 results in the latest round of testing. This number is more than double the previous week. It also comes amid an alarming rise in COVID-19 cases in the UK, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposing a new lockdown to keep the mutant strain at bay. Last week’s Premier League testing saw 18 positive results come back, which was the highest weekly figure since Project Restart. In recent weeks, a number of fixtures have been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreaks within squads. Fulham’s previous two matches – against Burnley and Tottenham – were postponed due to an outbreak in their camp, while Manchester City’s trip to Everton also got called off due to a spread among Pep Guardiola’s squad over the Christmas break.
