The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun has expressed sadness over the death of a former Minister of Commerce and Industries, Sen. Jubril Martins-Kuye. The party in a statement issued by Tunde Oladunjoye, its Publicity Secretary, in Ogun State on Sunday described Martins-Kuye’s death as “the passing away of one of Ogun’s finest politicians’’. “He was an uncommon bridge builder, patriot and a humane, courteous and humble politician whose model was politics without bitterness. “Either as a Federal minister or as a Senator of the Federal Republic, Martins-Kuye gave a good account of himself as an accessible community leader, grassroots mobiliser, moulder of people and builder of bridges,’’ he said. “We commiserate with Gov. Dapo Abiodun and the people of Ogun on the exit of the ‘political titan’. “We pray that God will grant the deceased immediate and political family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss,” he said.
