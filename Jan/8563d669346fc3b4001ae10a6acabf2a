Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has boasted that the All Progressives Congress, APC, will continue to win the presidential election in the country. Bello said APC would continue to win due to the party’s ability to mobilise Nigerians at the grassroot level. He spoke at the inauguration of the Party Women and Youth Sensitisation and Mobilisation Committee by the Yobe State Governor and Chairman Caretaker/ Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, on Tuesday. The governor disclosed that APC will liaise with stakeholders across party lines to actualise the party’s election goals. He said: “This is yet another one and by the grace of God, with the cooperation, understanding and the support of members of the party and Nigerians, we are very confident that we are going to deliver resoundingly once again. “I want to assure that we shall move to the field immediately. We are going to swing into action. We are going to liaise with every stakeholder within the party and across party lines. “We have taken up this responsibility. It’s a sacrifice, it’s out of patriotism, it’s a national assignment. We are going to deliver a resoundingly. The APC will continue to win every election in this country. “By the time we are done and all the registration of new members and revalidation of existing members are done in the country, APC will not just be the largest in Africa but we’re going to call on even the developed nations to come and learn from APC in Nigeria.” Recall that Bello was recently linked to APC’s presidential ticket. The Governor, however, distanced himself from such calls which he had described as a distraction. Bello had said he was focused on delivering his mandate to the people of his stated than pushing for APC’s presidential ticket.
