The Kaduna State University (KASU) has said it is ready to reopen on January 25 for the 2019/2020 second semester academic session if given the approval amid the second COVID-19 wave. The Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Muhammad Tanko, disclosed this in Kaduna on Monday during a stakeholders’ meeting on the reopening of schools, organised by the Kaduna State Ministry of Education. Tanko, who was represented by Prof. Yohanna Tella, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Administration), explained that the university proposed a six-week lecture if allowed to open on January 25. The vice-chancellor said that virtual lectures for large classes of more than fifty students would be conducted for students in the lower levels and physical lectures for small classes of fifty students for those in higher levels. Tanko said, “We’ve also planned practical classes in batches of fewer than 25 students for smaller classes and 45 for larger classes. “The examinations for 100 level and 200 level students will be computer-based. “We’ll also train and sensitise our staff and students on COVID-19 safety awareness and the need for social distancing.”
