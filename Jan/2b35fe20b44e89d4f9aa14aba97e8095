The Kaduna State Government has said that it’s yet to announce the official date for the resumption of primary, secondary and post secondary institutions in the state. A statement issued on Friday evening, which was signed by the Permanent Secretary, Kaduna State Ministry of Education, Phoebe Sukai Yayi, urged parents to disregard the fake news and rumour circulating round the social Media that all schools in the state resume on Monday 18, January 2021. According to the statement, “the attention of Kaduna State Ministry of Education has been drawn to a statement purporting that the state government has approved Monday 18/01/2021 as an official date for resumption for primary and secondary schools as well as higher institutions of learning in the state. “The ministry is informing the public that the news is FAKE and mischievous as Kaduna State Government is yet to make any announcement on that yet. The state government is assessing the COVID-19 pandemic with keen interest and will issue a statement when it deem fits and safe for students to resume
Meanwhile, the public is enjoined to disregard the purported statement,” the statement said.
