The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has refuted allegations that Minister for Niger Delta, Godswill Akpabio, bribed him in respect of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). Malami was accused of receiving billions to facilitate the appointment of Effiong Okon Akwa as NDDC Sole Administrator. In a statement on Friday, his spokesman, Umar Gwandu, called the claim “filthy assumptions of mischief makers and detractors”. Gwandu said it was an attempt to cast aspersion on Malami “and dent his hard earned reputation with unsubstantiated allegations spread by perfidious elements”. “The Minister has not collected and does not intend at any time to receive any gratification from any dealing and discharging any function he is constitutionally empowered to perform”, he noted. Malami dared individuals who have any information regarding those who facilitated and accepted the purported gratification to come out publicly. The AGF further encouraged them to approach relevant security and anti-corruption agencies with the facts.
