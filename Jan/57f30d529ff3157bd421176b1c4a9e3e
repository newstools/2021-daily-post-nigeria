A herb dealer, Rofiat Biliameen, has petitioned a Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan to dissolve her two and a half-year-old marriage to estranged husband, Ahmed Biliameen on grounds of deception and distrust. Rofiat told the court that her husband was also blackmailing and threatening to kill her. “In 2018, when I was looking for an apartment to rent, I informed Ahmed as one of the landlords at Ayegun-Olomi, he promised to get me an apartment which he did. “However, he soon started wooing me because according to him, nobody would give an apartment to an unmarried woman in that community. “So, I agreed to marry him but he started collecting my money ever since then. “Currently he owes me nothing less than N175,000, being the money I borrowed him for a ceremony and the construction of a container shop. “Besides, he has been threatening to kill me as I recently came across the voodoo he planted under my mattress,’’ Rofiat said. Her husband Biliameen in his defence denied all the allegations levelled against him. He said his wife was a mere opportunist adding that he did not owe her a dime. “It is true that I wooed Rofiat, but I willingly constructed the container shop for her. “I never collected any money from her for giving her two plots of land, but she keeps making all attempts to steal away with my property when I am not around. “When I saw that Rofiat does not wish me well, I decided to end the union and this is why she wants to run away with my property,’’ he said. Delivering Judgement Chief Ademola Odunade, the court’s President ordered both parties to produce the chairman of the landlord association in their community to shed more light on the matter. He adjourned the case until Feb. 11 for judgment, NAN reports.
