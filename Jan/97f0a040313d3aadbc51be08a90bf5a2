Bola Tinubu, All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, has described former Osun Governor, Bisi Akande, as Nigeria’s father. The former APC interim National Chairman turns 82 on Saturday. “You are an exceptional human being and Nigeria is proud to have you as one of its sons”, Tinubu said in a statement on Friday. The former Lagos Governor described Akande as a principled and selfless leader. He commended the celebrant’s for his contributions to democratic governance and to the progressive cause. “Characteristic of this selfless man is his enlightened decision not so much to focus on himself this special day but to call each of us to pray for national healing, so the country and Nigerians can overcome harmful consequences visited upon us by COVID-19.” Tinubu noted that since Akande enlisted in the Action Group in the First Republic to support the progressive ideals of late Obafemi Awolowo, he had not looked back. The APC leader said that the former governor has remained committed to vital and necessary ideals. He said: “Just as Awolowo did for him, Akande has been a father figure and an engaging helpful mentor to younger politicians across the country, particularly in the South-west”. The Jagaban added that Akande was a consummate teacher, tolerant and cosmopolitan in outlook, and an excellent human being. Tinubu prayed that God grant him many more years and excellent health.
