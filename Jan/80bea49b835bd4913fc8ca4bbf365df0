Medinat, who regretted her action, confessed in an interview with newsmen that she needed money for something, hence “she devised the fake kidnap” when her father refused to come to her assistance. She complained of “neglect and abandonment by her father following her mother’s death, as well alleged maltreatment by her stepmother.” The command’s spokesman said exhibits have been recovered and the case under investigation. He warned criminals to pack their luggage and relocate from Kwara State, as the command will stop at nothing in dealing with any criminal arrested no matter how highly or lowly placed.
