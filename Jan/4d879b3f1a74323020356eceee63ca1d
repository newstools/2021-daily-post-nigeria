Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has hailed Fenerbahce on their imminent signing of Mesut Ozil. Speaking with beIN Sport, Wenger expressed his belief that Ozil can propel them to the Turkish league title. The German was given permission by Arsenal to fly to Istanbul on Sunday evening to complete the final details of his January switch to Fenerbahce, having been frozen out at the Emirates by manager Mikel Arteta. “Well first of all I would say you have the pleasure to announce a transfer like that in a period where you will not have many transfers. “And he will certainly be the biggest transfer of the January transfer window, because the world of football is a bit quiet. “But overall it’s fantastic news for Fenerbahce, who are in a strong position in the league, and I think he can be the piece of the puzzle that will make them even more of a threat to win the Turkish league,” Wenger said.
