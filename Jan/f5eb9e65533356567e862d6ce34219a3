The Maiduguri Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has secured the conviction of Mustapha Kyari on one count charge of stealing. Justice Umaru Fadawu of the Borno State High Court, Maiduguri, delivered judgement. The defendant misappropriated N900,000 given to him by one Mohammad Modu to buy a house for one Yakura Zara (a widow) and her three children. The offence contravenes Section 311 of the Penal Code Act Cap. 102 Laws of the Borno State of Nigeria and punishable under Section 312 of the same law. The convict pleaded “guilty” when the charges were read to him. Mukhtar Ali Ahmed, the prosecution counsel, asked the court to review the facts of the case. A prosecution witness, Abubakar Hassan, who is also a detective in the Intelligence Special Operation Section (ISOS) of the EFCC.told the court that the money was entrusted in the custody of Kyari with a directive from Modu to give one Abdullahi Yahaya. “The accused refused to send the money as instructed which prompted the complainant to write a petition. We invited the petitioner. He reported to the office, adopted his petition and gave a written statement. “We invited the accused person. We had an interview with him and he wrote three different statements through his lawyer, where he admitted collecting the sum of N900,000 from the complainant.” The PW further told the court that Kyari only sent N345,000 to the intended recipient and squandered the rest. EFCC said the sum of N505,000 was recovered from him during investigations. Justice Fadawu pronounced Kyari guilty and convicted him accordingly. He adjourned the matter until Monday, January 11 for sentencing.
