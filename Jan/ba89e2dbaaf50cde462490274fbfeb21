The Lagos State Government has banned trucks and trailers from plying roads in the State during day time. The state Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde, made this known during a meeting with stakeholders in Ikeja on Wednesday. Oladeinde announced that trucks and trailers are now restricted to night operations on dedicated routes between the hours of 9pm to 6am daily in order to avert rising massacre on roads during daytime. He said the move was necessary as the Apapa area of the state has been rendered less profitable for investors due to the gridlock and activities of truck drivers along the axis. “This move was taken for the betterment of all Lagosians and also to avoid the rising number of deaths caused by the truck drivers in the state on a daily basis. “We also appeal to Stakeholders to cooperate with the State Government to remedy the situation,” he said. Also speaking, the Special Adviser to the state Governor on Transportation, Oluwatoyin Fayinka, declared that none compliance from truck drivers would be met with stiff penalties on defaulters. Fayinka advised the truck owners to utilize the grace period to get their act together and conform with the directives issued out. “We urge operators to secure parks outside Apapa to curtail the gridlock. “We also advise truck operators to work together with the State Vehicle Inspection Services, and the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and ensure their vehicles are always fit to ply the roads,” Fayinka said.
