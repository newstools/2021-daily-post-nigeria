Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has hoped that Arsenal’s new signing, Martin Odegaard, doesn’t find his form when both teams clash in the Premier League on Saturday evening. Solskjaer, a fellow countryman with Odegaard, also wished the 22-year-old midfielder all the best at Arsenal. Odegaard joined Arsenal from Real Madrid earlier this week on a loan deal for the remainder of the campaign. The Norway international is in line to make his debut for Mikel Arteta’s side against Man United at the Emirates Stadium. When asked about Arsenal’s decision to sign Odegaard, Solskjaer told a pre-match press conference on Friday: “Martin is a very talented young player, and we know from the national team that he can cause any team problems. “I just hope he’s not finding his form on Saturday [When Arsenal host Manchester United]. I wish him all the best. “He’s a good boy, good attitude, right character, so I am sure they have made a good signing there.”
