Liverpool midfielder, Fabinho, has denied claims that his teammate, Mohamed Salah, is ‘unhappy’ and could leave Anfield. Salah’s future at Liverpool has been a hot topic in recent weeks after the Egyptian international refused to rule out a move to Real Madrid or Barcelona after being ‘very disappointed’ at not being handed the captain’s armband by the Reds coach, Jurgen Klopp, during their Champions League match against Midtjylland last year. Speaking on the development ahead of Liverpool’s Premier League clash with Manchester United on Sunday, Fabinho told BeanymanSports, “Big players will always have their names involved in rumours. “Salah plays for Liverpool, one of the biggest teams in the world. So I think it is normal to see his name linked to other teams, especially from different leagues. “Anyway, I see him very happy here and pleased with his performances this season. “He’s very demanding with himself, he wants to be the best, he wants to help the team and works hard for it. “It’s always been the case and it has not changed at all. He keeps scoring goals, which everyone is used to seeing. “In the changing room he’s always talking to everyone and making jokes. I do not see anything affecting him. “Overall, I’m not following the news so I am not sure about any rumours. As I said, top quality players will always be linked to big clubs.”
