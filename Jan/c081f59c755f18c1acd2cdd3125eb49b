Former Nigeria President, Olusegun Obasanjo, has claimed God spared his life to witness 2021 despite the challenges of the past year. He urged those who survived COVID-19, to thank God for His mercies. According to Obasanjo, he was spared by God purposely to “serve Him and humanity more and more”. Obasanjo stated this while speaking at the second annual Thanksgiving Service of the state chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria held on Saturday, at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta. He said, “It is our duty to give thanks to God. You will be the most ungrateful person if you do not perform the duty of giving thanks to God. “In all circumstances, give thanks. Therefore, if you fail to give thanks, you are failing a very significant duty of yours as a Christian. “Last year 2020 was a very challenging year not only for us in Nigeria, not only for us in Africa but for the whole world. “The fact that you are alive calls for giving thanks to God. It doesn’t matter which way you look at it, those who you know as a result of Covid-19 are no more here with us not because you are better than they are, more knowledgeable than they are; it’s just by the grace of God. “And if God gives you that grace, to still remain on earth, maybe for a purpose and I believe part of the purpose is for you to continue to serve humanity and to serve God. You cannot be a servant of God if you cannot give thanks to him. “The purpose of being here is to perform our duty as Christians, by giving thanks to God.”
