Muhammad said Mr Yaro Abutu, the commissioner of Police in the state, immediately deployed a combined team of Mobile Police and CTU unit, who joined the Nigerian Army operating in the area, to secure the affected village and its surroundings. He said, “The combined team also engaged the bandits on arrival at the area, which saw the bandits running away with various degrees of gun wounds. “Peace has been fully restored in the affected communities, but our men have continued to comb the nearby bushes with a view to arresting the culprits and charging them to court for prosecution.” Muhammad added that the commissioner urged members of the public to desist from self-help, in order to sustain the relative peace presently being enjoyed in Zamfara.
