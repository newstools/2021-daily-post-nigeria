A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has dismissed the examination fraud charges brought against a Secondary School Principal, Alhaji Aregbesola Mufutau and three others who were put on trial along with Senator Nurudeen Ademola Adeleke by the Nigeria Police. The Judge, Justice Inyang Eden Ekwo, discharged and acquitted the four persons accused of committing the alleged examination malpractices alongside Adeleke on Tuesday. Justice Ekwo freed the defendants from the seven amended count charges while delivering a ruling in their no-case submission. In his ruling on the no-case submission, the Judge held that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case having not proved the ingredients of the charge. He further held that the burden of proof rested on the Police which, according to him, failed woefully in discharging the burden by not calling relevant witnesses. “In conclusion, since the testimony of the prosecution is insufficient to warrant the defendants to open defense, I have no difficulty in upholding their no-case submission and discharge and acquit them from the charges. This charge is hereby dismissed,” Ekwo held. Recall that the Police had in 2018 arraigned Adeleke along with Alhaji Aregbesola Mufutau (the school principal), Gbadamosi Thomas Ojo (a school registrar), Sikiru Adeleke (who is said to be the Senator’s relative), and Dare Samuel Olutope (a teacher) on a four-count charge bordering on examination fraud. However, the court had in 2020 freed Adeleke from the charges after it was withdrawn by Police. The Police then asked the court to sever the charge, to exclude Adeleke from the trial and arraigned the remaining four on a 7-count charge bordering on conspiracy.
