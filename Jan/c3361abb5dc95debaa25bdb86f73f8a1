New Paris Saint-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has called on forward, Kylian Mbapp, to improve his game following his side’s 1-1 draw against Saint-Etienne in a Ligue 1 tie on Wednesday. Romain Hamouma scored for Saint-Etienne in the 19th minute, before Moise Kean equalized just three minutes later for PSG. The result means PSG remain in the second position on the Ligue 1 table with three points behind Lyon. “Kylian needs to improve, like everybody else,” Pochettino said during his post-match press conference. “He should feel disappointed as we did not win, and he can always do better. However, his attitude was good. I am happy with what he did.” PSG’s next Ligue 1 fixture is against Brest on Saturday at Le Parc des Princes
