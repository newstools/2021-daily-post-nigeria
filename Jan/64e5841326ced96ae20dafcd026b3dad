Senator Roy Blunt of the Republican Party and a member of GOP leadership, has declared that President Donald Trump’s impeachment is “not going to happen.” “There is no way we’re going to impeach the President. There’s not the time to do it,” the Missouri Republican said in an interview with local Kansas City TV station, KSHB. “When Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were talking about it, it’s obviously just another political point trying to be made. It’s disappointing. It’d be much more disappointing if people can’t see that,” Blunt said. The House Democrats will as soon as Monday introduce articles of impeachment against Trump, according to CNN. Speaker of the House, Democrat’s Nancy Pelosi had earlier called for the President’s impeachment by invoking the 25th amendment for inciting violence. The incumbent President until this moment has refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory in the November 3 presidential election. Trump had rejected the election, making unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and filed numerous court cases challenging the results from various states. Having lost out in almost all the court cases, the President has been caught making prior efforts to stop the certification of the election result. Notwithstanding, the US Congress on Wednesday certified Biden’s victory amid attacks on the Capitol by the President’s supporters.
