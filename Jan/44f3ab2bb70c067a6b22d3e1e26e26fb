The Zamfara State Police Command has banned unauthorised use of siren, revolving light, tinted glasses, unregistered, covered and spy plate numbers with immediate effect. The Commissioner of Police, CP Abutu Yaro, who gave the warning, directed all Area Commanders, DPOs and Police Tactical Units to ensure total compliance, as well as to embark on the arrest of violators of the order. The state police boss also directed the full enforcement of other traffic regulations, saying that nobody should be a sacred cow or untouchable in the process. “No stone would be left unturned because we are seriously working hard to address the dastard activities ravaging the entire state,” he said. The CP further warned that any person or group arrested in violation of the order will be investigated and made to face the full wrath of the law. Yaro explained that the punishment given to the offenders would serve as a deterrent to others. He called on members of the public to continue to be law abiding citizens and also cooperate with the police and other security agencies in an effort to rid the state of all forms of criminal activities.
