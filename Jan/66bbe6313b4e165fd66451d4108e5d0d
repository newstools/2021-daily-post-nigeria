The Non Aligned Democracy Monitor has condemned the alleged biased opinion taken against the Speaker Kaduna State Assembly by the APC Chairman of seven local government areas in Kaduna Central. This follows the ongoing faceoff between the Speaker, Yusuf Zailani and Senator Uba Sani, representing Kaduna Central District, APC Chairmen of the seven local government areas in Kaduna Central had issued a statement calling for the sanction of the Speaker. Sensing a slant in the intervention of the chairmen, including those of Kajuru, Chikun, Kaduna South, Kaduna North, Igabi, Giwa and Birnin Gwari, the Non Aligned Democracy Monitor challenged the local party leaders on indiscretion. The statement issued by the chairman of the group, Dauda Sani Aliyu, said, “We are concerned that the local APC chairmen of the seven local governments of the Kaduna Central have caught themselves in political bias involving the slanting and altering of information to make the position of Uba Sani seem more attractive. According to the group, their (APC chairmen) self-serving set of bias emerged in the context when they engaged an open inability and deliberate unwillingness to understand and fairly analyze the two politically opposing points of view. The group advised the APC chairmen against the unwarranted and arbitrary show of political bias going beyond simple presentation and decent understanding by favouring a particular political leader. They said it would have a lasting impact with drastic effects on future voter behaviour towards the Party and consequent political outcomes. According to the group, “This shameful show of lack of political neutrality or the barefaced violation of political neutrality by the seven local party leaders only goes to confirm accusations against them of insatiable greed for personal gains over the general interest of the Party.”
