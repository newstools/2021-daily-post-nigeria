Residents fled their homes in Gujba town of Gujba local Government Area of Yobe State less than 24 hours after the Nigerian Military launched an operation codename ‘Tura Takao Bango’ meaning ‘ We have been pushed to the wall’ in reaction to the terrorists’ ceaseless onslaughts on the region. Residents of Gujba, who spoke to newsmen in Damaturu the Yobe state capital, said, their town is currently under attack by the insurgents who burnt down health facilities and other structures in the area. “Boko Haram is currently attacking our town,” a resident, Umar Adamu told DAILY POST, adding that “Our people have left their homes as I am talking to you.” Gujba seems to be the first reaction by the terrorists shortly after the military said they are ready to give a final push to clear the remnants of the terrorists and deny them the will to operate in the northeast. According to residents of Gubja, there was rumour of letters in circulation that the terrorists were coming to attack but residents felt that letter would end up as rumour, however, the attack this evening is a proof that the insurgents are very much around. Another resident, Ibrahim Usman stated that while soldiers have blocked the way to Katarko another town to deny the insurgents from making an inroad to the town, troops were also seen making efforts to engage the terrorists in Gujba town. “Troops have been mobilised to the town to engage them. We are waiting but many of our people have fled to safety,” Ibrahim Usman said.
