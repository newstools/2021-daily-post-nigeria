Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has said his players will take part in 11 vs 11 training to get their “rhythm” back, ahead of their crunch clash against Manchester United on January 17. The hectic fixture schedule has meant little respite for Premier League sides. However, after Friday night’s 4-1 victory over Aston Villa in their FA Cup third-round clash at Villa Park, the Reds now have nine days to prepare for their league meeting with United. Klopp named a strong side against a Villa side, which had academy players because of a COVID-19 outbreak at the Midlands club. Liverpool have stuttered in the Premier League and are without a win in their last three games. This poor form has allowed in-form United to make up the ground on them, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side able to go top of the table if they beat Burnley on Tuesday.
But Klopp is relishing the break for his team and admitted they will be looking to get in lots of practice matches in preparation to face the Red Devils. “We have a lot of players with no rhythm, so we will do a lot of 11 vs 11 situations because that’s the most important thing for football players that we couldn’t give them too often,” the German boss told BT Sport. “So now we have the time, and we will use it for that, yes.”
