The ban was contained in a statement signed by the Special Assistant to the governor on Media and Publicity, Mr Francis Nweze, and made available to newsmen in Abakaliki on Thursday. According to the statement, Governor David Umahi disclosed this at the flag-off of the second wave of COVID-19 protocol compliance campaign at the Exco Chambers of the old Government House, Abakaliki. Nweze explained that the governor also directed complete enforcement of COVID-19 precautionary measures, including not more than two hours of worship on Sundays. According to him, Umahi announced plans to begin local production of oxygen in the State to cut the cost of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. He called on the people to embrace steam inhaling to detoxify themselves and expressed the determination of the government to scale up testing beyond 450 per local government area. The governorâ€™s aide said that Umahi mandated stakeholders to step up sensitization and supervision to schools and other public places.
