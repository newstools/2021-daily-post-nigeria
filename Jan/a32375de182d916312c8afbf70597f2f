The Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, has warned traditionalists in the Ikorodu Local Government Area of the State to stop fortifying cultists and criminals in the area. The police chief gave the warning while speaking at the Ikorodu Town Hall Meeting on Security, held on Wednesday. Hakeem said community leaders must also ensure that the safety of everyone in their environment is paramount by exposing all criminal elements. “The Local Government Councils in Ikorodu must occupy the front line in combating crimes in the area. “The traditional institution in the division must condemn the activities of the cultists in their area instead of supporting them and their criminal acts. “The members of the public, especially landlords should also join in the fight against insecurity in Ikorodu by thoroughly screening those to be accommodated in their houses. “The traditionalists and traditional worshippers in this area must stop promoting and protecting the criminals in Ikorodu axis and Lagos State in general. The idea of fortifying these boys and providing native charms for them should stop. Their powers must be used to assist us not to jeopardise our efforts in providing enough security for the citizens,” he said.
