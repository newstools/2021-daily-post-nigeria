President Muhammadu Buhari has promised Nigerians that his government will work towards bettering their lives in the New Year. In his New Year broadcast to the nation, Buhari said that the year 2021 will indeed be a year “where we will work to reinforce the hopes of fellow Nigerians in the vision of a united and progressive Nigeria.” According to Buhari, his “administration would continue focusing on delivering key strategic priorities under our “SEA” – (Security, Economy and Anti-Corruption) Agenda. ” Buhari said that security, economy and anti-corruption were on top some of the key issues his administration will prioritise in 2021. The President noted that insecurity as a challenge has direct repercussions on the country’s economic stability, growth, and development and has set the country back at critical points through the destruction of public and private investments. He lamented that Boko Haram and other groups have thwarted government’s efforts to undertake the social and investments that lift such areas from hunger. Buhari, however, expressed the hope that the resilient spirit of Nigerians and the attributes of “can do, will do” will lead the country to its destination and “fulfill our calling together, especially with the solid resolutions we are setting in this new year.”
