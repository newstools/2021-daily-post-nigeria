Two cemetery guards were on Sunday arrested by men of the Ondo State Security Network Agency, otherwise known as Amotekun Corps for alleged possession of human heads. The two cemetery guards were said to be workers at a cemetery belonging to an old generation church in Surulere Area of Ondo town, headquarters of Ondo West Local Government Area of the state. Residents of the area alleged that the suspects had been tampering with corpses buried in the cemetery where they guard. One of the residents who craved anonymity disclosed that one of the security guards simply identified as Alhaji was apprehended with a bag containing the heads of dead bodies by those living in the area. The source said, “Today (Sunday) somebody went to defecate in a bush beside the cemetery and he saw Alhaji with a sledgehammer and he broke one of the tombs in the cemetery. After some minutes he came out with a bag. “So the person that saw him raised the alarm and we rushed to the scene. When we checked the bag Alhaji carried, we saw a human head in the bag. “When we went around the cemetery, we discovered that about 44 tombs have no dead bodies inside them, they have been exhumed by ritualists. So we have handed them over to the Amotekun corps.” Confirming the development, the Commander of Amotekun in the State, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, stated that the two suspects were rescued when the residents were about to lynch them. The Amotekun Commander, however, said human heads were not found on the suspects upon arrest. He said, “The suspects were rescued by our men when the residents were about to kill them. We have handed them over to the police.” When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, ASP Tee- Leo Ikoro said the suspects had not been handed over to the police.
