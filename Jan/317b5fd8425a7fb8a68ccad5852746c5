A former member of the Enugu State House of Assembly, Obinna Okenwa, on Sunday defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Okenwa represented Enugu South Urban from 2015 to 2019 on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). NAN reports that he decamped with over 500 supporters including his father, Emma Okenwa, ex-PDP deputy chairman in the state. The former legislator said he decided to join the APC due to its progressive nature, adding that the PDP had lost touch with reality. “We have the capacity to move things and make them happen. With the support of the leadership of the APC, we shall defend the party with all our strength,” Okenwa said. APC state Caretaker Chairman, Ben Nwoye, hinted that more citizens would join the APC soon. Former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, urged the South-East people to fully embrace the platform controlling the federal government. In attendance were the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama and former APC Vice Chairman, Emma Enukwu.
