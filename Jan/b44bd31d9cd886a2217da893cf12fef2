The All Progressives Congress, APC, on Thursday, opened up on the chances of Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, emerging as its presidential candidate in 2023. Ex-Deputy National Publicity Secretary of APC, Yekini Nabena, said Tinubu’s chances are dependent on his alliances with party stakeholders from other zones in the country. Speaking with DAILY POST, Nabena said: “I don’t know or tell how strong Tinubu’s chances are because politics is all about alliance. “It depends on who he is aligning with and his alibi. A tree cannot make a forest, you can be strong in a particular state but what about others. “However, politics is all about numbers, so i can’t say much about anybody’s chances. No matter the zone you are from you still need to work with other zones because it’s the people that will count.” Meanwhile, former and current Speakers of State Houses of Assembly in the South West on Thursday threw their weight behind the projected presidential ambition of Tinubu. They made their stand known during a meeting in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital.
