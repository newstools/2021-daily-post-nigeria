President-elect, Joe Biden has condemned the riots that erupted at the US Capitol building in Washington D.C. The Democrat called it an “assault” on America’s democracy. President Donal Trump supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol as Congress debated the vote count on Wednesday. The protest started after Trump addressed his followers vowing “never to concede”. “Our democracy’s under unprecedented assault. Unlike anything we’ve seen in modern times. An assault on the citadel of liberty, the Capitol itself. An assault on the people’s representatives and the Capitol Hill police, sworn to protect them. And the public servants who work at the heart of our Republic… “Let me be very clear. The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect a true America. Do not represent who we are. What we’re seeing are a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent. It’s a disorder. It’s chaos. It borders on sedition. And it must end now,” Biden said. CNN reports that a White House adviser said some aides around Trump are becoming furious. He disclosed that they want him to make a statement to begin to calm the situation. “He doesn’t want to” to do more than what he is doing right now”, the adviser said.
