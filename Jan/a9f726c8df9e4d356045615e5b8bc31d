About 100 people have been killed in Niger Republic. Scores of militants stormed two villages in the western part of the country. There have been increased killings in the jihadist-dominated Tillaberi region. Almou Hassane, Tondikiwindi Mayor, confirmed the latest incident. He said the attacks on Tchoma Bangou and Zaroumadareye villages were carried out by “terrorists who came riding about a hundred motorcycles”. Around 70 were murdered in Tchoma Bangou and 30 dead in Zaroumadareye. The massacre coincided with the announcement of results for the first round of Niger’s presidential election. President Muhammadu Buhari, in a statement on Sunday, condemned the killings. He said it was another call for united action by African leaders against terrorism. “I am profoundly shocked by the large scale death
of innocent people at the hands of these callous militants who have no regard for the sanctity of human life. “We are facing grave security challenges on account of the evil campaign of indiscriminate violence by terrorists in the Sahel and only united action can help us defeat these vicious enemies of humanity.” He stated that “terrorism has now become like a contagion of evil that can spread anytime if united action is not taken.” The Nigerian leader said that instability in one part of Africa had implications for the security of others. Buhari said the destabilisation of Libya in 2011 negatively affected the security of other African countries including Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon and others. “The looting of Libyan armouries in the aftermath of Gaddafi’s fall has put dangerous weapons into the hands of terrorists and other criminals who now pose security challenges to other countries,” he added. Buhari expressed sympathy for the government, people of Niger and the victims’ families.
