A Donald Trump adviser, Jason Miller, has dismissed reports that the former President was going ahead with his intention to create the ‘Patriot Party’. On Sunday, Miller said Trump’s plan was to win majority seats at the U.S. Congress for the Republicans next year. “The President has made clear his goal is to win back the House and Senate for Republicans in 2022. “There’s nothing that’s actively being planned regarding an effort outside of that, but it’s completely up to Republican Senators if this is something that becomes more serious”, he tweeted. Miller reacted to a Daily Mail report that Trump is keen on putting pressure on Republicans who oppose him and are pushing for his conviction at a second Senate impeachment trial. Trump has been at Mar-a-Lago since he left the White House last Wednesday. Since he lost the November 3 election, there have been speculations about him spearheading the formation of a third party.
