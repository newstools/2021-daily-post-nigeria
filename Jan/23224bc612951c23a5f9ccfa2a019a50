Popular Fashion designer, Alexander Wang has reacted to accusations of sexual assault against him. In December, multiple allegations of sexual assault surfaced on social media against Wang. One model Owen Mooney, in a viral TikTok video, alleged that a famous fashion designer sexually assaulted him at a crowded club in New York in 2017. Days later, a TikTok user guessed that he was referring to Wang and Mooney confirmed. “Turns out Alexander Wang is a massive sexual predator,” Mooney alleged in another video. He called for the persecution of Wang, adding that his status and power is no excuse for his behaviour. Also, an Instagram page @s—tmodelmgmt, with unconfirmed screenshots from anonymous people alleged that Wang has been accused of sexual assault “for a few years now”. However, Wang speaking with E! News, described the allegations as baseless and false. He said: “Over the last few days, I have been on the receiving end of baseless and grotesquely false accusations. These claims have been wrongfully amplified by social media accounts infamous for posting defamatory material from anonymous sources with zero evidence or any fact checking whatsoever.” Wang, disclosed that he had never participated in the alleged act and would never do that. He said, “The lies about me being perpetuated as truths has been infuriating. I have never engaged in the atrocious behavior described and would never conduct myself in such manner that’s been alleged.” The 37-year-old designer promised to investigate the claims and hold those responsible for spreading such lies. “I intend to get to the bottom of this and hold accountable whoever is responsible for originating these claims and viciously spreading them online,” Wang added.
