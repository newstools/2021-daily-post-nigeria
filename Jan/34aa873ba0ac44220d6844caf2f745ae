Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, was challenged by one of his squad members during a recent team meeting, the UK Mirror reports. Arteta is still dealing with tension inside the dressing room, despite the team turning a corner with back-to-back wins against Chelsea and Brighton. It is understood that one ‘disaffected’ senior player confronted the Spaniard in front of his stunned team-mates. The unnamed squad member questioned why other first-team player have been treated differently this season. Arteta is keen to clear some of the ‘deadwood’ in his squad in the January transfer window. Players like Mesut Ozil, Sokratis and William Saliba have been frozen out and it is believed that their absences is a cause of friction. On Thursday, Sead Kolasinac completed a six-month loan move to former club Schalke and several others are expected to follow.
