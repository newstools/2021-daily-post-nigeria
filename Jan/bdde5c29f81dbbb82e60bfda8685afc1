Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has confirmed that defender, Fikayo Tomori, will leave the club on loan this January transfer window. Lampard said this on Sunday after Chelsea’s FA Cup third-round 4-0 win over Morecambe. The Blues boss said that was one of the reasons he did not start Fikayo against Morecambe. Chelsea defeated Morecambe at Stamford Bridge thanks to four goals from Mason Mount, Timo Werner, Callum Hudson-Odoi, and Kai Havertz. “Situation with Fikayo is open about the moment,” Lampard said at his post-match press conference after the game. “There is a possibility he could be going on loan to get games somewhere else. “So that would have to be the solution for him and the club. “That was part of my thinking of not starting him today [against Morecambe].”
