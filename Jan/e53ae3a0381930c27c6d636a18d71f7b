Olusegun Bamgbose, National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has noted that the refusal of the Armed Forces Remembrance Day pigeons to fly signals impending doom for the country. President Muhammadu Buhari got tired and walked away to attend to the other businesses of the day having failed in all his efforts to make the birds fly. It was the Armed Forces Remembrance Day and the birds usually flew away as a symbol of peace and unity but Friday was a different case as none of the pigeons flew. A development that Bamgbose, a senior lawyer, described as not only a bad omen, but a very serious warning of an impending doom. According to him, “This presumably might be the first time this will be happening in the history of marking the day in Nigeria. Pigeons are not ordinary birds. “They are the most disciplined birds on planet earth. They signify peace and love. Unknown to many, they do avert dangers,” he said while expressing the fear of uncertainty in a chat with DAILY POST. “When you house them, you hardly can experience sudden unexpected evil. The refusal of them to fly at the Armed Forces Remembrance today is a clear indication that something serious is wrong somewhere. “It’s not just a sign of bad omen, but a serious warning that except certain things are put in place, disaster looms. “The Presidency has 21 days to make amends or the undesirable will happen. The 21 days will expire by the 5th day of February 2021. “I plead with the Presidency to take this seriously. If nothing is done, the unexpected might happen. This is a very serious warning that has a time limit of just 21 days,” he added.
