Czech Football Federal has claimed that Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo, has not broken Josef Bican’s all-time goal-scoring record. According to the CFF, Ronaldo will have to score 62 more goals to do so, insisting that Bican actually scored 821 goals and not 759. Ronaldo found the net for his 760th time (officially) for club and country when Juventus beat Napoli 2-0 in the Italian Super Cup on Wednesday seemingly surpassing the Austrian-Czech great. But the CFF published a statement thereafter, claiming Bican’s tally actually stands at 821. “The History and Statistics committee of the Czech FA counted all the goals scored by the legendary Josef Bican and we can declare he scored 821 goals in official matches,” a tweet by the Czech football federation said. The lengthy statement by the CFF was posted on the Czech football federation’s website. It stated that 821 is the “most accurate number possible” when it comes to counting how many goals Bican scored throughout his career. “The answer is – Josef Bican scored 821 goals in official matches,” the statement read. “It can be stated with full seriousness that this is a number that corresponds to the current state of the possibility of verifying all data, so it is the most accurate number possible.”
