United States Vice President, Mike Pence says he would not seek to invoke the 25th Amendment which would remove President Donald Trump from office. There are mounting calls for Pence to use his power to declare Trump unfit to perform his duties. On Tuesday, the VP, in a letter to House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, opposed the Democrats’ demand. Pence described the pressure on him as “political games”. “Under our Constitution the 25th Amendment is not a means of punishment or usurpation. Invoking the 25th Amendment in such a manner would set a terrible precedent”, he said. Democrats want Trump impeached as punishment for his supporters’ attack on the Capitol Building. On Monday, they introduced an article of impeachment against the outgoing American leader.
