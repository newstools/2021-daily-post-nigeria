The Zamfara State wing of the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) has flagged off the extended special public works program for fourteen thousand youths in the state. The Director-General of the Directorate, Abubakar Nuhu Fikpo while addressing participants said the initiative would have commenced some three months ago but was regrettably delayed due to unnecessary and avoidable circumstances. According to him, the extended special public works program has been designed as a veritable tool through which the lives of 774, 000 unemployed youths will be positively touched in the next three months. He said the implementation of the 774,000 extended special public works program will involve recruitment of 14,000 youths in the state with a collective payment to the participants to the tune of N84 million at N60, 000 per participant for the three months period. â€œOur communities will receive a facelift through the activities of the participants as they engage in various community and environment-specific public works. Fikpo explained that appropriate working tools, as well as protective wears, have been provided for the participants in their daily schedules. The state coordinator of the Directorate, Abdulahi Yakubu informed that 14,000 youths will benefit from the program, as the Directorate drew 1, 000 youths from each of the fourteen Local Government Areas of the state. Alhaji Yakubu noted that the selection was based on the list from the state selection committee and that of the National Directorate of Employment which was combined to make way for the final selection, he said.
