Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has warned Jurgen Klopp’s side that his players are in good shape, form and are hungry to beat them when both teams clash in the Premier League on Sunday at Anfield. Solskjaer gave the warning following Man United’s 1-0 win over Burnley on Tuesday night. Man United are currently on top of the Premier League table with three points ahead of Liverpool ahead of this weekend clash. “It’s a brilliant position to be in. Of course we know we are going to meet the champions, they have had unbelievable three-and-a-half seasons so we know that is going to be a difficult game for us but we are ready for it,” Solskjaer said at post-match. “I think we could not have asked for a better time to play them, because we are in good shape, in good form, we are hungry – that is the big thing, these boys are hungry. “They want to get better and that is a test again, a test of character and a test of quality.”
