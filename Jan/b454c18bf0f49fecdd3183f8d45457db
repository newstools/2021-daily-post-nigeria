Workers of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) have threatened a total shutdown if the Federal Government fails to address their demands. NIMC workers on Wednesday asked the President Muhammadu Buhari government to see the 20-day window of the suspended industrial action as an advantage to address all their demands. It said that failure to do so; the government will risk another strike by the Commission. Speaking to Channels Television, the Chairman of the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria, NIMC Chapter, Asekokhai Lucky, said that the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy Isa Ali Pantami has not available for the meeting where he is expected to address even though the workers suspended the strike for this reason. They cried out that Commissionâ€™s headquarters is lacking in adequate computers, insisting it slows down the pace of work. The workers explain that the registration and capturing process takes about five minutes, but the lack of adequate computer systems slows the pace of work. Last week, workers of the Commission went on strike, protesting poor welfare and the lack of motivation. The strike was suspended on Monday after the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy intervened.
