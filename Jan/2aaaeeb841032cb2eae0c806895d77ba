Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has revealed that some players in his squad are struggling with COVID-19 for longer than others. Speaking ahead of Sunday’s Premier League clash with Manchester City, Lampard admitted it has been “very challenging” for his medical staff. Coronavirus is once again affecting the league schedule, with Everton’s fixture against Manchester City, Tottenham’s game at Fulham, and Burnley’s meeting with Scott Parker’s side all recently called off. The outbreak also threatened the clash between Chelsea and City, but the game is still set to go ahead, despite both camps struggling with omissions. Pep Guardiola’s side is missing five players, while the Blues are without two members of staff. When asked to describe the situation, Lampard told Sky Sports: “Very challenging, not just for me but the medical team and sports science because some players are asymptomatic and come back training within a few days and reach their top level, but then there are some players who take longer. “They report tiredness and fatigue and because everything is so new, we don’t have anything to gauge it by. We don’t have the right methods to know how to get players back to a level as quickly as possible. “It’s not just us but a problem for the league. This year is different and will be different until we get to the other side.”
