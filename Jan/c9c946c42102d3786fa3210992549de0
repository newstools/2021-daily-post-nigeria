The Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, has said that the Federal Government will be left with no other option but to impose another lockdown if the rise in COVID-19 cases continues. The Minister, during the 2021 budget breakdown in Abuja on Tuesday, prayed that the situation should not get to that point when Nigerians would be forced to stay in their home again. According to her, “We hope we never have to lockdown the economy like we did before because the impact is very high on the economy but then if the health challenge becomes so large, and the government has no option then that step might be taken.” The Minister noted that what the government is doing at the moment was to reinforce the measures that need to be taken to mitigate the impact from the virus. DAILY POST had earlier reported that the Federal Government may be forced to declare another lockdown after the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases crossed the 100,000 mark in the country. The NCDC had last Sunday reported 1,024 new cases. It brought the total number of infections to 100,087. NCDC also said the total number of deaths was now 1,358 and the case fatality rate was 1.5 per cent in the country.
