The federal government has advised Nigerians to disregard conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines. National Orientation Agency (NOA) Director-General, Garba Abari, addressed citizensâ€™ concerns in a statement on Monday. Abari said insinuations that the vaccines were for population control and DNA altering were false. The official assured that no vaccine would be allowed into Nigeria or administered without the approval of appropriate authorities. He said the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) would do their job properly. Abari added that COVID-19 vaccines had been subjected to standard tests and certified safe by the World Health Organisation (WHO)
