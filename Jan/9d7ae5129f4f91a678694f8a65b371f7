Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta has commented on the performance of Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka following his side’s 3-0 win over Newcastle United in the Premier League on Monday. Arteta said that Smith Rowe and Saka both performed well against Newcastle, adding that he was pleased with what they are bringing to the Gunners’ team. Arsenal defeated Newcastle at the Emirates Stadium, thanks to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s brace and a strike from Saka. “When someone is performing, it doesn’t matter what his profile or his age is. I think they [Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka] deserve to play,” Arteta said at his post-match press conference. “They were really good again tonight, and I am really pleased with what they are bringing to the team.” Arteta added: “When they have their opportunities to show that they are better than the ones that are playing and that we are wrong with our decisions. “To be fair, everybody is training hard, everybody is trying to contribute, and the ones that are not playing, their attitude and behaviour have been so far, so good.”
