One Imoleayo Ashade has reported to the police in Ogun State that she was duped to the tune of N1,310,000 by some individuals who promised to give her financial breakthrough. Ashade told the police that she must have been hypnotised by the men, who she said lured her to their hideout to help her become rich. This was after the victim had helped the suspects in securing a place to sleep one night. “I think I was hypnotized, because at first, I believed everything they said. They told me to bring my fiance so that, we can both be empowered spiritually. “We went there, they gave us black soap to bath so that, money can come, but they made us swore an oath that we would not tell anybody. “I was using the soap with my fiance before he went to NYSC camp. I suddenly regained consciousness one day and I immediately informed the OPC members in our area, who invaded their secret hideout with the police,” Ashade was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, the police have arrested the suspects, who were identified as Salau Taiwo, Ifakunle Adeyemi, Tajudeen Jimoh and Adebayo Akeem. They were arrested at their shrine in the Ijagun area of Ijebu Ode. At the shrine, a box containing various denominations of fake currencies, charms and a cash of N1,310,000 allegedly collected from Ashade were recovered by the police. The State Commissioner for Police, Edward Ajogun, while on a visit to the crime scene on Thursday, disclosed that the arrest was made by the Awa-Ijebu police division with the support of OPC and vigilantes in the area. Ajogun assured that the suspects will be prosecuted as soon as investigations are concluded.
