President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, has said only God can ensure victory over insecurity. Adesina said most Nigerians have failed to understand that only God can ensure victory in the area of insecurity. He pointed out that Nigerians who refuse to pray for God’s intervention in the area of insecurity are guilty of indirectly prolonging the war against insurgency. The presidential spokesman stated this in an article entitled, ‘The Decent for the Indecent, the Just for the Unjust’. Adesina, however, lamented that rather than pray for troops battling insurgency, Nigerians are wailing. He wrote, “But victory is from God alone. That is what we must realize as Nigerians. Do we ever pray for our troops in the frontlines? “As we pray; God give me money. Give me a car. Give me a promotion. Kill my enemies, did you pray for our soldiers? Victory comes from God alone. If you don’t pray, you may be guilty of prolonging the war in North-East, North-west, North-central, and all over Nigeria. “Yes, victory is from God alone. But do some people know? Does it ever enter into their consciousness? They only wail: ‘this insurgency war has lasted too long. The banditry has demystified our military. They are cowards. The top guns don’t even want the battle to end.” Nigeria has been confronted with the challenge of Boko Haram Insurgency, banditry, and kidnapping lately. A few months ago students were abducted from Government Science Secondary School in Kankara, Katsina State. The students were, however, released.
