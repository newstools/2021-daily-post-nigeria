Chelsea ‘will go all-out to sign Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund this summer’ and are willing to smash their transfer record to get him, according to The Athletic. Haaland has a £66.6million release clause in his contract which cannot be triggered until 2022. The 20-year-old is attracting attention from some top European clubs like Real Madrid, Manchester United and Manchester City. It is understood Chelsea will try to sign Haaland at the end of the season, even if it means paying significantly more than the release clause. Dortmund is reluctant to lose the striker, who has scored 35 goals in 35 matches for them since arriving from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2020. But Chelsea wants to sign a world-class finisher and believe the impact of Coronavirus on club finances across Europe gives them a window of opportunity to outbid their rivals this summer. At the moment, Chelsea’s record spend on a player is the £80m Kai Havertz will cost them if all add-ons are triggered. —
