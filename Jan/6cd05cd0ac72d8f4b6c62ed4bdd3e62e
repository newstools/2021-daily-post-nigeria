Oyo Governor, Seyi Makinde, says his administration is investigating the alleged highhandedness of the Amotekun corps. He assured that all issues will be addressed squarely in the interest of the security and residents of the state. Makinde gave the assurance on Friday while reacting to the clash in Tapa town in Ibarapa North Local Government Area. Three people were feared dead during a clash between youths and the Amotekun corps. Makinde said the government will not allow any harassment or intimidation of members of the public or security agents. “I am fully aware of the alleged highhandedness by some members of the corps. We are investigating these issues to address them promptly.” The governor urged everyone to remain calm and allow members of the corps to perform their legally authorised duties. “If any corps members are abusing their office, they will be dealt with accordingly,” Makinde said.
