Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said the imminent return of Thomas Partey will feel like a new signing, as he praised the midfielder’s “enormous talent”. Partey was signed from Atletico Madrid for £45.3million last summer but has not featured much for the Gunners. The Ghanaian returned from a month-long absence to start the north London Derby on December 6th but broke down again with a recurrence of a thigh problem. The 27-year-old is gradually working his way back to full fitness and could feature against Newcastle in the FA Cup on January 9. “We are in January and I think he’s played two and a half games, that’s all and he was our main signing. “We’ve been missing him. He brings something different to the team, he’s a player with enormous talent. But as well someone that can transform the team the way we want. “It’s great if we can have him, keep him healthy and I think he will contribute in a really positive way,” Arteta said after their 4-0 win over West Brom.
