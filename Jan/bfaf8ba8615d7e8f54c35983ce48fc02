The people and government of Adamawa State are worried over the rising cases of COVID-19 Of the 1,664 confirmed infections reported from 23 states, Adamawa has 47, the highest the state has ever recorded in a single day since the first confirmed case in April last year. Among the affected states in the latest update are Lagos with 642, FCT (407), Plateau (160), Kaduna (83), Rivers (62), with Adamawa coming on the sixth spot with 47 fresh cases. The latest figures place Adamawa as the 26th worst affected state with a total of 424 confirmed cases, but it comes out as the 14th worst state in number of people on admission, having 161 of such people. Adamawa’s position may not appear grim to people in other parts of the country but for Adamawa people themselves, it is bad. A resident of the state capital, Yola, Mr Japhet Amos, said Thursday morning, “I had not heard of any COVID-19 infections around the state for a long time, so I was shocked when I woke up this morning that we have 47.” Another resident, Ama Gayus, said, “I hear that 161 people are on admission in this Adamawa State! It is unbelievable and scary.” The state government had expressed worry over the COVID-19 resurgence. The government had lamented earlier in the week that residents were not complying with initial rules such as wearing of face mask and observing of social distancing and had vowed to redirect energies to observing the rules and saving the state.
