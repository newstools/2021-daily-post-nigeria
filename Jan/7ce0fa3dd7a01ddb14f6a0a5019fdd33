Some Chelsea players have reacted to the sack of Frank Lampard as the Blues manager. Lampard was sacked on Monday by Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, after 18 months in charge at Stamford Bridge. Lampard’s last game as Chelsea manager was a 3-1 victory over Luton Town in the FA Cup fourth round tie on Sunday. Reacting, Chelsea defender, Thiago Silva, took to his Instagram account to thank Lampard for his help during their short stint together at the West London club. Silva wrote, “I would like to thank you for everything you and your committee have done for me since the day I arrived. “As I told you, it seemed like we had been together for 10 years!! Thank you for everything, legend.” Also reacting, Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham, posted a picture of himself with Lampard together, writing: “A role model, a mentor and a great manager. Thank you Gaffer.” Lampard guided Chelsea to a fourth place finish last season in the Premier League. Chelsea are currently in the 9th position on the Premier League table with 29 points from 19 games.
