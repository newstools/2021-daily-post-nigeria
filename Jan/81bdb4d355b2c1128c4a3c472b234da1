The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has charged Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to wake up to his responsibilities. In a statement on Saturday, Giwa warned of escalating activities of violent Fulani herdsmen. The cleric expressed disappointment over Akeredolu administration’s approval of grazing in the state. “I am calling on Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to put an end to grazing and rearing of cattle on the streets of Akure, especially in Igoba, Akure North local government. “Fulani herdsmen have taken over Akure, Igoba. Ikare, Owo and other areas in Ondo state. They have already occupied Igoba. “These people have started naming streets after themselves, I forsee trouble if not checked. Before they start chasing people from their houses, Governor Akeredolu must act urgently”, he warned.
