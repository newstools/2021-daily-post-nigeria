The National Youth Service Corps on Thursday extended the Orientation camp registration date for the 2020 Batch B Stream II to January 25, 2021. NYSC extended the date to allow all prospective Corps members to report and register at their various Orientation camps. The scheme, however, warned that those who fail to register will not be allowed to revalidate with the 2021 Batch A Orientation course. In a series of tweets signed by the management, NYSC wrote: “2020 BATCH ‘B’ STREAM II PCMs “All 2020 Batch ‘B’ Stream II Prospective Corps Members (PCMs) who are yet to report for the NYSC Orientation Course are hereby advised to report immediately at the Orientation Camps. “You are to note that those who fail to report for this Orientation Exercise will not be allowed to revalidate for 2021 Batch ‘A’ Orientation Course. Hence, to accommodate PCMs yet to report, camp registration has been extended to Monday 25th, January 2021. “You are therefore advised to leverage on this extension in your own interest. Wishing you all journey mercies to your respective Orientation Camps.”
