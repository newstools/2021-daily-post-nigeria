The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has claimed that travels, reopening of schools, businesses and religious centres, contributed to the rise in COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. There are currently over 100,000 confirmed infections in the country. With the second wave of coronavirus in full force, the government is reviewing the date for resumption of schools. Chairman of the PTF and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, speaking during Monday’s media briefing in Abuja, named factors that led to the spike in numbers. “It is, however, very instructive to stress that factors that have contributed to rise in numbers from late November 2020 included increased local and international travels, business and religious activities, reopening of schools without strict compliance with COVID-19 safety measures,” Mustapha said. Last week, the federal government admitted it would have no choice than to impose a fresh lockdown in the country, if the number of COVID-19 infections continue to spike.
