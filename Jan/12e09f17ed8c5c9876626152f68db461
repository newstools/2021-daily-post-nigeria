The President Muhammadu Buhari-led government has threatened to deal with committers of violence in Nigeria. Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, gave the warning in a statement on Tuesday amid tension in Ondo and Oyo States. He called for unity, peace, and implored all citizens to exercise restraint, Aregbesola said incidences of heightening ethnic and religious tension were partly outcomes of political and economic strains. The Minister assured that the government is having a holistic look at the challenges and will stop at nothing to bring lasting security and amity to all communities. He warned that the government will not tolerate “any act or behaviour capable of jeopardising law and order and security of lives and property in any part of Nigeria”. The former Osun Governor said as authorities work out long term answers to address the problems, the people should remember that self-help and lawlessness cannot offer a path to a sustainable solution. “It can only lead to greater pain as well as costly human and material losses and disruption of the already difficult task of devising responses that will produce tangible peace and development in the country,” Aregbesola added.
