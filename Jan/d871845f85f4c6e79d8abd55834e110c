Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has revealed that he expects midfielder, Dele Alli, to stay at Spurs amid interest from Paris Saint-Germain this January transfer window. Mourinho said this at his pre-match press conference on Wednesday ahead of Tottenham’s Premier League clash with Liverpool on Thursday night. Alli has been strongly linked with a move to PSG since Mauricio Pochettino replaced Thomas Tuchel at the French Ligue 1 champions last December. The England international has fallen completely out of favour with Mourinho this season. “I expect [Dele Alli to stay this month], I am saying that since the beginning of the transfer window,” Mourinho said. “Not expecting anyone to leave [Tottenham], not expecting anyone to come.” Mourinho’s side are currently in the 6th position on the Premier League table with 33 points from 18 games.
