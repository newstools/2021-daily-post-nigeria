Chelsea’s hierarchy has identified Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers, as a possible replacement for Frank Lampard, if he is fired, according to the UK Mirror. Lampard is fighting for his job at Stamford Bridge, after the Blues slipped seven places in the Premier League in the space of six weeks. Chelsea went top of the table in early December, but have lost five of their last eight matches to slip to eighth, five points outside of the top-four places. Lampard will be looking to get a win on Sunday in the FA Cup against Luton Town on Sunday, to give himself a bit of breathing space. The former England midfielder has been doing well in cup competitions. While Russian owner Roman Abramovich respects Lampard and is desperate for him to succeed, he will not tolerate many more mediocre performances, especially after he sanctioned a £200m spending spree last summer. If Abramovich’s hand is forced and Lampard goes, Chelsea could look to move for Leicester boss Rodgers. It is understood that senior officials at the club have been impressed by Rodgers, who is one of the most highly-rated coaches in Europe. Rodgers, who used to coach the youth team at Chelsea, almost led Leicester to the Champions League last year.
