Former Chelsea and Arsenal defender, William Gallas has spoken on ex-Chelsea striker Diego Costa joining Arsenal, adding that the player will bring ‘character’ to Mikel Arteta’s squad with his ability to spark his team-mates into action. Costa terminated his contract at Atletico Madrid at the end of December 2020 and became a free agent. The Spain International lasted 3 years at Chelsea scoring 52 goals. He was a nemesis of Arsenal during his stay in London. The Brazilian-born striker helped the Blues to two Premier League titles but played only seven times at Atletico this season due to a combination of injuries and increased competition for the striking role at the club. Costa is now available on a free transfer in January, and Gallas believes the Arteta’s side could benefit from the striker’s fiery nature. “He would bring character to the squad,” Gallas told PlayOJO. “He just wants to win games. If his team mate doesn’t play well, he will shout at them during the game and sometimes I think this is good. “Sometimes, when I’m watching Arsenal, they don’t show any reaction when they concede, and someone like Costa will shout to the guys ‘Wake up!’ which can boost the players. “If he comes to Arsenal, he will cause a lot of problems for defenders but it might also mean [Alexandre] Lacazette going on the bench again.”
