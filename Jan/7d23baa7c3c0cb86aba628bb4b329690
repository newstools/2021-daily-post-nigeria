A farmer identified as Atsegba Ukua, and his son have been arrested in Gbajimba, Guma Local Government Area of Benue state for rustling six cattle. Rtd. Col. Paul Hemba, Special Adviser on Security to Gov. Samuel Ortom, confirmed this to newsmen on Saturday in Makurdi. Hemba said that Livestock Guards on Friday arrested Ukua and his son while they were on their way to sell the cattle. Ukua told the Livestock Guards that he took the cattle on his farm to recover the losses as they destroyed his crops. “We do not accept Ukua’s explanation. He is a cattle rustler and will be treated as such. He and his son will be handed over to the police for prosecution. “This is part of the reason why Gov. Ortom advocated for ranching to end all forms of criminality associated with open grazing,’’ Hemba said. He disclosed that the six cattle would be given to Meytti Allah representatives to hand over to the owner when found. Akua said that in 2020 he seized several sheep in his farm and handed same to Livestock Guards and the Army, but he did not hear from them again and was not compensated either. This, he explained, prompted him to take his latest action.
