Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani Kayode, has taken a swipe at Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State for accusing Christians, white men and Asians of being Boko Haram members. DAILY POST had reported that Governor Babagana Zulum said some Boko Haram members were Christians, Muslims, white men and Asians. The Governor, who spoke during the 17th Chief Gani Fawehinmi Annual Lecture organised by the Nigerian Bar Association in Ikeja, Lagos State, said Nigerians should see insurgency as a general challenge and not just a Northeast problem alone. He also said the high rate of unemployment, poverty, drug abuse and nepotism were all causes of terrorism and banditry. Reacting, Kayode in a tweet via his Twitter account on Monday said the Governor’s allegations were lies from the pit of hell. According to him, no real Christian will be in the ranks of an Islamic terror group whose objective is to wipe Christianity off the face of the earth. ”The allegation that there are Christians in Boko Haram by Gov. Zulum of Borno state is a lie from the pit of hell. “No real Christian will be in the ranks of an Islamic terror group whose objective is to wipe Christianity off the face of the earth. “I have lost respect for Zulum,” he wrote.
