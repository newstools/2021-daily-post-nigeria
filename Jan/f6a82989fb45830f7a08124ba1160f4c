Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, on Wednesday, met with President Muhammadu Buhari to discuss the security situation in the state. He declared that his administration remained resolute about fighting bandits, hoodlums, armed robbers and kidnappers. Makinde insisted that the real enemies of Oyo were the criminal elements. The governor spoke to State House Correspondents after his meeting with Buhari. He said: “The issue that I discussed with Mr. President is the fact that Oyo State landmass is quite big. Oyo State is close to 29,000 square kilometres. And the state right now only has two Mobile Police Squadrons. “I requested for more Mobile Police Squadrons to be deployed to Oyo State and also asked for support for the joint security outfit because the underlying issue here also has to do with limited opportunities. “The tension will definitely go down if a lot of our youths are gainfully employed. What triggered all of these was that Dr. Aborode was brutally murdered; that is criminal. But on the other hand, the Seriki, Alhaji Kabir, has been staying in that same place for 40 years.” Makinde reiterated that the Constitution of Nigeria guarantees that anyone can live in any part.
