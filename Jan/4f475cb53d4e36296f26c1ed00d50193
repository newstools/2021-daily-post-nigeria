New Paris Saint-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has warned his players that they “have to deserve to wear the club’s jersey”. Pochettino has replaced Thomas Tuchel at the Parc des Princes, signing a two-year contract. It is his first job since he was fired by Tottenham Hotspur in November 2019. The 48-year-old will have to get the best out of the likes of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Angel Di Maria, but has already made it clear that his team selection will be based on effort and professionalism rather than status. “In this club, it’s always been about excellence, the players have to deserve to wear the jersey,” Pochettino told the club’s official website. “I think that it’s a fantastic squad and I think that we can accomplish what this club and the players want because they are competitors and they want to lift trophies.”
