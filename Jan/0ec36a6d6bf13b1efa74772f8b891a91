The management of the Kaduna State University, KASU, has terminated the appointment of Dr. Idowu Abbas of the Geography Department, over allegations of sexual harassment. The Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) of the school, Prof. Abdullahi Ashafa, disclosed this in a statement in Kaduna on Friday. Ashafa said Dr Abbas’s appointment was terminated after the university’s Senior Staff Disciplinary Committee, chaired by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Administration), investigated the alleged sexual harassment against the lecturer. He said the report of the investigating committee was presented at the 217th Management Meeting of the institution on Jan. 12. The management also instructed that all students under his supervision be reassigned to a decent lecturer in the department. Part of the statement read: “According to the report, Abbas confessed in his testimony to have touched and hugged a female student he was supervising her project from behind against her will, when she went to his office to discuss her project. “His testimonies also revealed other nasty and randy misbehaviour he exhibited to the student.” According to Ashafa, such gross misconduct violated Section 8.7 Paragraph (f) of the Administrative and Academic Regulations in Kaduna State University and punishable by dismissal and/or termination of appointment. The deputy Vice-Chancellor also described Abbas’ earlier resignation as “null and void.” Lecturer suspended for allegedly impregnating student NDDC: Akpabio opens up on sexual harassment allegation by Joy Nunieh Polytechnic Ibadan terminates lecturer's appointment over alleged sexual misconduct
