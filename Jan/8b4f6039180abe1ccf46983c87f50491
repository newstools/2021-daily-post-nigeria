No fewer than five civilians were allegedly killed at Ilesha-Baruba, Baruten local government area of Kwara following a clash between some soldiers and commercial drivers. The SP Ajayi Okasanmi, the Kwara Police Public Relations Officer who confirmed the incident to newsmen said the command was yet to ascertain the number of casualties, both dead and injured adding that investigation would be carried out to ascertain the true situation. “The Commissioner of Police has ordered a full-scale investigation into the crisis and we will communicate our findings very soon. “However, normalcy has been restored to the area with the deployment of men of the state command,” he said. NAN reports that the clash which erupted on Friday evening was due to a misunderstanding over bookings between soldiers mounting roadblocks on the Ilesha-Baruba/Chikanda expressway, and commercial drivers plying the route. A source who spoke to newsmen said a driver who was coming from Sinawu market in the area, refused to pay N200 allegedly demanded by the officers on the road. According to the source, the driver was reported to have told them that he was already booked and he paid earlier in the morning. His refusal, however, infuriated the officers and the driver was allegedly slapped and ordered to do frog jumps while his vehicle was seized. ”Due to the development, members of the union followed the driver with the aim of talking to the soldiers on his behalf. “This degenerated into unpleasant arguments, leading to the alleged shooting of some drivers with three allegedly dying on the spot and two dying later from gunshot wounds,” he said.
