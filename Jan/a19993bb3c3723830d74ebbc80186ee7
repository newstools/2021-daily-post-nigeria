No fewer than eight persons were butchered by bandits in Dutsin Gari and Rayau villages of Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State in a recent attack. An eyewitness, Malam Ibrahim Mamman who spoke to our correspondent said the bandits came with unnumbered motorcycles to Dutsin Gari village last night to abduct some people but unfortunately were challenged by angry villagers. Maman explained that the villagers confronted the bandits and a serious fight which lasted several hours ensued. “When the bandits noticed that the tension on them was too much, they knew that they could not succeed in their dastard activity, they opened fire and killed six people, injured many and moved to a nearby village called Rayau”, he lamented. Maman said the bandits also faced similar challenges from the villagers who were already waiting on receiving the report of what happened in Dutsin Gari village. “The villagers came out in large numbers and engaged the bandits in a gun battle where two of the villagers lost their lives and the bandits left without abducting anybody”. Mamman added. He further noted that the bandits returned to the two villages early this morning only to find out that many people had fled to Kanoma town for fear of reprisal attack. He explained that the angry bandits set many houses on fire and carted away domestic animals. Recall that bandits had kidnapped forty worshippers including the Imam in Dutsin Gari village during the Friday prayers a few months ago. However, all efforts to speak to the Zamfara Police Public Relations Officer,(PPRO), SP Mohammed Shehu, proved unsuccessful as he didn’t pick up the phone calls.
