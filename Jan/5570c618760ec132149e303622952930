Festus Keyamo, the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, has insisted that the 774,000 jobs are basically meant for everyday labourers to carry out community services. Keyamo disclosed this in a tweet via his official Twitter handle on Monday. His tweet read: “The 774,000 jobs is basically for our everyday labourers to carry out community services. “It would not be financially prudent if the Govt were to spend billions for expensive equipment for 3-month jobs, then spend millions again training our labourers on how to use these equipment.” Keyamo had last week revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the commencement of the Special Public Works Programme which would engage 774,000 unemployed Nigerians. The programme was designed to employ 1,000 Nigerians from each of the 774 Local Government Areas in Nigeria was initially scheduled for launch on October 1, 2020. The initiative ran into delays following the power play between Keyamo and the Director-General, National Directorate of Employment, Dr Nasiru Mohammed Ladan Argungu, who was sacked last year’s December. Every one of the 774,000 workers will get N20,000 monthly for 3 months duration of the job.
