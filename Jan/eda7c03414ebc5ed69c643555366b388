Iran has applied to Interpol for the arrest of United States President Donald Trump over the death of General Qassem Soleimani. A U.S. drone strike eliminated Soleimani on January 3, 2020 at Baghdad International Airport in Iraq. On Tuesday, Iran’s justice spokesman, Gholamhossein Esmaili announced his country’s request. “We have filed a ‘red notice’ at the Interpol against 48 people, including Trump, U.S. commanders, and Pentagon representatives as well as U.S. troops in the region. “The Islamic Republic of Iran is very seriously following up on pursuing and punishing those who ordered and executed this crime,” Esmaili told reporters. Soleimani, head of Iran’s Quds Force, was killed along with Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, Deputy Head of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces, and others. Iran insists America’s action was against international law and the United Nations (UN) charter.
