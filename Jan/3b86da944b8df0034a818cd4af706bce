Atletico Madrid manager, Diego Simeone, has been declared Coach of the Decade. Simeone saw off competition from Real Madrid’s Zinedine Zidane, Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola, Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp, and Tottenham Hotspur’s Jose Mourinho to win the prize. This was disclosed in a statement released by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS) on Wednesday. “Simeone achieved a great performance with his club Atletico Madrid in this decade: 1 LaLiga title, 1 Copa del Rey, 1 Supercup Spain, 2 UEFA Europa League titles, 2 UEFA Super Cup titles and 2 times Runner-Up in UEFA Champions League Finals. “His regularity and his power made the difference to win the Award of the Decade 2011-2020,” IFFHS statement read. During the last ten years, Simeone has won fewer European titles than Zidane and not as many league honours as Guardiola but has accrued enough points in the ranking system because of his consistency at Atletico Madrid. The overall results placed Guardiola and Klopp second and third, respectively, while Mourinho occupied the fourth position. Others are Max Allegri (5th), Unai Emery (6th), Zinedine Zidane (7th), Carlo Ancelotti (8th), Mauricio Pochettino (9th) and Marcelo Gallardo (10th).
