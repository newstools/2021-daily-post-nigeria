The Minister of State for Health, Dr. Olorunnimbe Mamora, has hinted that the ongoing National Identification Number (NIN) registration may be suspended over COVID-19 risks. Mamora Stated this while speaking on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily on Monday. He urged the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to go back to the drawing board and re-order the process to avoid large crowds at its centres nationwide. Mamora who is also a member of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, said the government has a duty to ensure citizens are protected at all times. “I don’t feel good-looking at the picture where people are gathered in multitude; it is like a superspreader event which we don’t like. “But I’m also aware that the relevant ministry which is the communications and digital economy is looking at this. “My understanding is that the whole process may be suspended, so as to reorder the whole process in terms of management of the crowd,” Mamora said.
