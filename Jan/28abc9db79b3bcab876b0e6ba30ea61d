We left them in the bush and went there to feed them. “We were not there when they died, so we stopped going there, and I stopped calling their father,” Muyideen told newsmen. Speaking with journalists while being paraded by police at Osun State Police headquarters in Osogbo on Friday, the herdsman, Isa, confessed that he was the one who cited the village. “We took them to a bush in Coker village and we were there for four days.
