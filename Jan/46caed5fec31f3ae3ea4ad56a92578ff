The Coordinator Defence Media Operations, Major-General John Enenche, on Friday downplayed the power of Boko Haram in Nigeria. Enenche boasted that Boko Haram no longer have authority over any territory in Nigeria. He spoke while appearing on Channel Television’s Politics Today. Enenche insisted that what Nigeria now has are remnants and a weakened Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters. “They are moving from bush to enclave and enclave to bush and no longer have any authority or sovereignty on any territory in the northeast and by extension, to Nigeria. “As of 2015 before this administration came on board, at least 17 and 20 local governments were strongholds of the insurgents by 2016 the whole of the northeast was recaptured and the government took back full authority,” he said.
