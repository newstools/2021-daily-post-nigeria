Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said the team’s 0-0 draw at Liverpool will only be a good result if they win their next game. The Red Devils played out a goalless draw at Anfield. The result ensures United remain at the top of the table, two points ahead of Leicester City with 18 fixtures played. “It is only a good result if we win the next game. It was an opportunity missed with the chances we had. But again we were playing a very good side. “I’m disappointed, but still a point is okay if you win the next one. “We were stronger towards the end. We didn’t start at all in the first half. We didn’t have any composure or try to impose ourselves,” Solskjaer told BBC Sport. United travel to Fulham next on Wednesday, January 20.
