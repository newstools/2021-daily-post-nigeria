Derby winger, Jordon Ibe, has opened up on his struggle with depression. The 25-year-old bared it all in an emotional Instagram post. Ibe joined the Championship side from Bournemouth as a free agent at the end of last season. Since then, he has made one appearance this season and has not been included in a matchday squad in 2021 under manager Wayne Rooney. “I want to apologise to all my fans around the world. I’ve found (sic) myself in a dark place, due to suffering from depression. It’s no scheme for the media or to have my name in your mouths, I just find things hard truly. “I appreciate all the love and messages from everyone. Times are hard in general due to this pandemic. I have the full support from my family and the Derby County football club. “I will fix myself and this situation, which I’m 100 per cent committed to. Not only for my family, close friend or my daughter but for me,” he wrote. Ibe moved to Liverpool as a 16-year-old in 2011 and made his Premier League debut in 2012/2013 season. He then moved on to Bournemouth in an £18 million deal in 2016.
