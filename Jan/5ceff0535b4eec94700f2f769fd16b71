Factional Chairman of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Imo State chapter, Ambassador Azunna Akpaelu has decried the emergence of Ambassador Obiozor as the new President General of Ohaneze Ndigbo held at the Dan Anyiam Stadium, Owerri on Sunday, 10th January, 2021. The factional State publicity secretary, Val Igwebuike, who made the condemnation said the elections were faulty from the beginning, because there were no local government chapter elections as provided in the constitution of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization. Igwebuike said the actual election was conducted in Enugu on 8th January in which Chief Chidi Ibeh emerged the National President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo. He claimed that external forces used prominent Imo political leaders in Ohanaeze Ndigbo to foist leaders of the group on the people. He accused the organizers of the Owerri election as willing tools to scuttle the 2023 presidential ambition of Igbo sons. Igwebuike queried the legality of bringing the election venue to Owerri instead of Enugu which had traditionally been slated as venue for the election. He faulted the setting up of Electoral Committee by the President General whereas it was the exclusive mandate of the Secretary General to do so. He insisted that everything was done to circumvent the electoral rules of the organization solely to scuttle the ambition of an Igbo man emerging the president of Nigeria in 2023. According to him, Chief John Nnia Nwodo only brought his cohorts to Owerri for the said election.
