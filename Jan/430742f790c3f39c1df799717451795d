A former Tottenham Hotspur striker, Darren Bent, has urged Arsenal to sign Real Madrid star, Isco, straight away this January transfer window. Bent believes Isco would raise Arsenal’s dressing room, quality, and the front players because of his creative nature. Recall that Isco had drawn the interest of Arsenal in the past few days. “I think bringing in a player like Isco with his quality I think would be a good signing [for Arsenal],” Bent told talkSPORT. “Smith Rowe has been very good in the last couple of games, but he is only young. “We know Smith Rowe’s stepped up, but we can’t all of a sudden depend on him for the rest of the season. “He is young, he is only played a couple of games, but someone like Isco might raise the dressing room, the quality, the front players will quite enjoy playing with a player like him, his creative nature. “We need that type of player, Ozil does not look like he is going to come back. “I would’ve had him back in January but if you aren’t and you can get him out the door, then maybe do that and bring Isco in. “So, Isco would be a superb signing, I think.”
