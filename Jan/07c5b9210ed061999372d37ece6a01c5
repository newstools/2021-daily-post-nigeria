A socio-political group, World Igbo Peoples Assembly, (WIPAS), has said that Ndigbo has the largest stake in Nigeria and will not leave it for anybody. The Igbo organization noted that Igbo nationalists led the independence and that Nigeria owes a lot of debt to Ndigbo especially on political, structural and infrastructural fronts. WIPAS in a statement signed by its Chairman, Board of Trustees, Mazi Chuks Ibegbu and issued to DAILY POST on Saturday, asked all politicians from other geopolitical zones nursing presidential ambitions to think twice in the interest of Nigeria. The group noted that what Ndigbo needs today is not a physical Biafra but a Biafra of the mind. The Igbo Assembly noted that a physical Biafra can only happen if Igbos are pushed to the wall as it happened in the past. The group queried the Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi for abandoning the Port Harcourt rail line and failure to site any federal transport project in the East. The group called for the creation of additional states in the South East noting that the zone loses more than two trillion Naira annually for having the least number of states and local governments in Nigeria. On the Ohanaeze post-election crisis and its possible effect on Igbo Presidency project, World Igbo Peoples Assembly (WIPAS), noted that conflicts are features of life and the conflicts in Afenifere or Arewa in the past did not make them not to produce presidents. “Why should on our own be different. After elections all over the world, there are grievances and protests. It is normal. We shall resolve it soon and we call all the political parties to zone their 2023 Presidency to Igbo land and South East in particular”. The Igbo sociopolitical body also warned military elements to desist from the brazen invasion of villages in Orlu, Imo state and noted that the military must obey the rules of engagement to avoid undue conflicts in the country. “They should face and defeat Boko Haram and not molest innocent people”.
