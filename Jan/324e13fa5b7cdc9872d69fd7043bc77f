Daniel Olukoya, the General Overseer of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, MFM, has called on Nigerians to take COVID-19 seriously. Olukoya urged Nigerians to adhere strictly to the COVID-19 protocols laid down by the Federal Government because the virus is real. The MFM General Overseer made the appeal yesterday after inaugurating a remodelled University of Lagos, UNILAG’s Senate Building. He lamented that most Nigerians don’t believe that the virus was real. “The first thing is to convince the populace that it is real because some people don’t believe it exists. But I am a man of God and I have prayed for so many people with the same infirmity and I know that it exists. “So, we should not joke with it. People should obey all the rules. And most importantly, we should pray that this pandemic will go away,” Olukoya said. The cleric urged the government to pay more attention to awareness campaigns targeted at persuading Nigerians to believe that the virus is real. Meanwhile, Nigeria recorded 1,354 new COVID-19 infections as at Tuesday night. The figure was disclosed by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
