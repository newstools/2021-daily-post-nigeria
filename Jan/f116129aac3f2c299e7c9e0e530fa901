Two staff of Fina Trust Microfinance Bank were on Wednesday arraigned before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court over alleged stealing of N720, 508 belonging to the bank’s customers. NAN reports that Sodeeq Adeleye and Idowu Popoola, aged 34 and 38, respectively, are facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. The prosecutor, Sgt. Kenrich Nomayo, told the court that the defendants committed the offences from May 2020 to December 2020 at No. 46 Toyin Street, Ikeja. Nomayo said the defendants received the money from customers of the bank with an instruction to pay the money into their accounts. According to him, all attempts to retrieve the money have remained fruitless; they converted the money to their personal use. He said the alleged offences contravened Sections 287 (7) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Delivering Judgement, the Magistrate, Mrs O. O. Fajana, admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N200, 000, with two sureties in like sum. Fajana ordered that the sureties should be gainfully employed and provide evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She adjourned the case until Feb. 9 for mention.
