The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has reacted to the resignation of Service Chiefs, stressing that the senior security officers listened to the party’s voice. PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said the Service Chiefs outlived their usefulness, hence their resignation. Speaking with DAILY POST, Ologbondiyan said the incoming Service Chiefs should put an end to the spate of insecurity in the country. The spokesman of the opposition party insisted that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari was ineffective. According to Ologbondiyan: “The Chief of Army Staff and his colleagues listened to the voice of eminent Nigerians and PDP that if the president refused to sack them then they have outlived their usefulness and as such, they should resign. “If they on their own resigned their commission believing that they have outlived their usefulness then what is left for us is to set an agenda for the incoming Service Chiefs. “And the agenda before them is that they must strive to put an end to the spate of insecurity in our nation because of the ineffectiveness of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.”
