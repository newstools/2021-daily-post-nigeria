The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has opened its portal for the 2020/2021 admissions. DAILY POST visited the boardâ€™s website and confirmed this. The portal gives institutions access to upload names of shortlisted applicants for the 2020/2021 admissions. The admission processes must go through the Central Admission Processing System (CAPS) for approval. Earlier this week, JAMB warned the public not to fall prey to fraudsters and rumour mongers. The board stated this in a weekly bulletin of the Office of the Registrar and confirmed it has yet to begin the sale of the 2021 Unified Tertiary and Matriculation Examination (UTME) forms.
