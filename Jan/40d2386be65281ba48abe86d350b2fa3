Former Chelsea striker, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, hit out at goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga following the Spaniard’s first-half error in the Blues’ FA Cup fourth round 3-1 win over Luton Town on Sunday. Hasselbaink insisted that it is a problem for Kepa because any other top goalkeeper in the Premier League would have kept out Jordan Clark’s strike. Kepa, who started ahead of summer arrival Edouard Mendy, managed to get his right hand to Clarke’s driven strike, it was yet another moment to forget for the shot-stopper as the tame effort squirmed past him. However, three goals from Tammy Abraham ensured Chelsea qualified for the FA Cup fifth round ahead of the Championship side. “For me, he [Kepa] needs to save this, sorry,” Hasselbaink told BBC Sport. “Sorry but I think he sees enough of the ball, the player. What is the player going to do there? He’s going to hit the ball. “Every time he goes in goal at Chelsea, he knows he’s under pressure because everyone is looking at him because of how he started, how he did last year. And this obviously does not help him as well. “If you look at the other goalkeepers in the league at the top end, they would save this. That is where he is at, and it is a problem.”
