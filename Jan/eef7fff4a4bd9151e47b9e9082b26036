The Head of Chamber, Mba Ukweni and Associates in Calabar, Cross River State, Ntufam Mba Ukweni, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), has appealed to the newly-appointed Service Chiefs that the change in the saddle should be genuine. Speaking to DAILY POST on Tuesday night, the legal luminary lamented the delay in changing the service chiefs, saying that this exposed the country into several security challenges. “The change is a welcomed development but it came too late. The action taken by the President today was long overdue. Why did it take him this long” he asked. “We appeal that let the change be a proper change. Let it not be a change that will continue with the poor leadership and shortcomings that existed before now. I thank the President for eventually harkening to the yearnings of the people,” he stated. He said it was very offensive to the sensibilities of the people when the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, yesterday stood up to praise the Government handling of the security situation and defend the indefensible. “The President’s action has proved the statement of Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information, wrong. He knew he was not telling Nigerians and the whole World the truth. It was a falsehood he was perpetrating. “Prominent Nigerians and other well-meaning persons, including the National Assembly, have complained variously, demanding for the change of guard. There is no improvement in the security situation in the country. “Insecurity was spreading like wildfire and the president’s attitude was seen as an act of condoning criminality and lawlessness. The entire security architecture should be reformed to meet the security demands.”
