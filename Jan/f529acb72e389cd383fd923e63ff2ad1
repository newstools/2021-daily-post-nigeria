Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has pleaded for more patience with Eden Hazard, after he struggled to make an impact in their 2-1 defeat to Athletic Club in the Spanish Super Cup semi-final on Thursday. Two first-half goals from Raul Garcia was enough to give the Basque side victory, despite Karim Benzema’s strike in the 73rd minute. Hazard managed just one shot on target, before he was taken off early in the second half and replaced by Vinicius Junior. The Belgium captain has struggled with injury since his move to Madrid and has scored just twice in 10 appearances in all competitions this term. But Zidane says the 30-year-old needs time to get back to his best. “You have to be patient, what you need is to score a goal. You have to be patient. The team has tried. You have to turn the page and keep working. We can’t go crazy now,” he told reporters after the game. “I don’t think people are tired of him. You have to be patient with him. He wants to get this out. Today it wasn’t just Eden. We started the game badly, but he did well in the second half.”
