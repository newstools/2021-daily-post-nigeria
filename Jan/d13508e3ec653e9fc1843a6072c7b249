The Federal Government has been warned against reopening of schools in the country. Olusegun Bamgbose, Esq., National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, gave the warning on Thursday citing the increase in confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections in the country. He urged the Federal Government to be extremely cautious in view of the spike and upsurge of the pandemic in recent weeks. He noted that the new variant of the virus is no doubt causing a lot of havoc in the country. “Yes, our students should go back to school and learn, but we don’t want to lose them to COVID-19 pandemic,” he said during a chat with DAILY POST. “It’s only the living that can learn. Caution is the key word. The government should not just bow to pressure from the parents and stakeholders in education, at the expense of the lives of our students. “I believe parents will prefer their wards lose one month of learning than lose the child entirely. Schools cannot be closed down indefinitely, but certain measures must be put in place to ensure that our students are safe. “One would have advised that the university students be allowed to resume first, not necessarily because they have stayed at home for a while, but because most of them are adults and they can easily take some precautions more than those in primary and secondary schools. “The parents equally have a role to play in ensuring their wards are safe. May the Lord keep us safe till we witness the end of this deadly pandemic.”
