AC Milan striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, has apologized for his sending off during their 2-1 defeat to Inter Milan in a fiesty derby on Tuesday. Ibrahimovic gave his side the lead in the Coppa Italia quarter-final, before tempers became frayed in the San Siro. The Swede and Romelu Lukaku, who played together at Manchester United, locked heads and exchanged words at the end of the first half. The pair had to be kept apart as the players left the pitch for the interval. The referee brandished a yellow to both players, before giving Ibrahimovic another caution and a red in the second half for a foul on Aleksandar Kolarov. “He apologised like the great champion he is,” Milan manager, Stefano Pioli, said. “He got a bit caught up in the desire to help the team. “It was not easy to stay in the game a man down. The pressure from Inter was strong.”
