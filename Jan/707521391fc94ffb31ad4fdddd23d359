Fenerbahce will allow Mesut Ozil take part in a light training session on Sunday, if he passes his medical and posts a negative COVID-19 result, SportingLife reports. Ozil has been in quarantine since he flew in from London to complete his move from Arsenal. The 33-year-old’s period of quarantine in Turkey ended on Friday and he is now in the final stages of completing the transfer. Ozil has agreed to a three-and-a-half-year contract with his boyhood club. Fenerbahce hopes to formally announce the signing on Monday or Tuesday, if everything goes to plan. Major League Soccer’s DC United had also been linked with a January move for Ozil, who retired from international football in 2018. But the player only ever wanted to join Fenerbahce.
