The Lagos State Chapter of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has advised Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to strive hard to provide satisfactory dividends of democracy to residents of the state in 2021. The state PDP Publicity Secretary, Mr Taofik Gani, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Thursday, while assessing Sanwo-Olu’s performance in 2020. “As a constructive opposition party, the year 2020 was not satisfactory in terms of dividends of democracy to Lagos residents. “Most of the local council chairmen performed below average, Sanwo-Olu should look into that because the chairmen are putting too much pain on the people due to their abdication of duties. “We are indeed very anxious to take over the government as an opposition party in Lagos,” Gani said. According to him, the party shared with the government of the day lots of programmes that would have brought succour to the people of the state. The spokesman, however, lauded Sanwo-Olu for abolishing the bogus pension for former governors and their deputies in the state, describing the decision as populist. “We have heard some people commending him, if he can continue in that order, perhaps; he will have the guts to face the problem of godfatherism in his party. “We want to counsel that he should look away from partisanship and be the governor for everybody, including the Igbo people, the Hausa, the Yoruba and all minority groups in the state,” he said.
