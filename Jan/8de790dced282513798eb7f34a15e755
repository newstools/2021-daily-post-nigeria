sUnited States House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, says she’s in support of the calls to impeach President Donald Trump.
Her comments followed the demand by Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader, for Trump’s immediate impeachment. “I join the Senate Democratic leader in calling on the vice president to remove this president by immediately invoking the 25th amendment. “If the VP and cabinet do not act the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment”, Pelosi said on Thursday. Their calls were in protest of Trump supporters’ invasion of the Capitol Building on Wednesday. Four people have been confirmed dead; an investigation has commenced. Also on Thursday, Transportation Secretary, Elaine Chao, announced her resignation. Chao, wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is the first cabinet member to quit. In a statement, she noted that America experienced a traumatic and avoidable event. “As I am sure is the awe with many of you, it has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside. “Today, I am announcing my resignation as U.S. Secretary of Transportation, to take effect on January 11, 2021,” Chao, said. At least three White House officials have tendered their resignation.
