Fire is currently burning down shops and valuables at the Kugbo Furniture Market, Asokoro Extension, Abuja. In a video obtained by DAILY POST, residents of the area could be seen running around and packing what they could. An eyewitness to DAILY POST said that the fire, which started around 6am on Sunday, had lasted over one hour before the men of the Fire Service arrived. A shop owner, who cried uncontrollably, told our correspondent that he just stocked up his shop yesterday but everything has gone down in flames. Another shop owner, who simply identified himself as Joe, said all his goods went with the fire, adding that this happens every year, either in December or January. According to him, “there should be standby fire service officials since the case has become like this.” Another victim, Emeka, said his shop was burnt too but he was able to save a little he could. Operatives of the National Emergency Management Agency arrived the scene about 3 hours after the fire started. Videos:
