Democrats in the United States House of Representatives introduced an article of impeachment against President Donald Trump on Monday. The American leader, in his final days in office, is being accused of sedition. “President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government. He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of government”, the charge partly read. Last Wednesday, Trump’s supporters attacked the Capitol Building after his “never to concede” vow. Democrats also introduced a resolution urging Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and strip Trump of his powers. Republicans’ rejection of the bill set the stage for a vote on Tuesday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned their decision. Pelosi accused them of enabling the president’s unhinged, unstable, and deranged acts. “Their complicity endangers America, erodes our Democracy, and it must end”, her statement read. The House impeached Trump in December 2019 by 230 to 197 votes.
