Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has warned footballing authorities that his side will refuse to play two-midweek games again amid a potential fixture pile-up. Spurs’ Premier League fixture against Fulham was recently postponed due to a COVID-19 outbreak in their opponents’ squad. And their match on Wednesday against Aston villa could be at risk too for the same reason. With Spurs still involved in the Europa League and kicking off their FA Cup campaign against Marine this weekend, Mourinho’s men could be set for a hectic few months of action. But speaking ahead of the match against Marine, Mourinho warned that he and his team would not be bullied with regards to the rearranged fixtures. “It is a completely impossible position for a club to have three matches postponed, especially if that club plays in Europe,” he said. “We thought we might be having to play a game if we had only 14 players available from the whole squad, including the academy. We were prepared for that. “We had positive cases. We cannot deny it. Players, coaches, other staff. We have had problems.” Mourinho added: “The only thing we can say is that what we did in the beginning of the season is impossible to repeat and we refuse to repeat. We would never accept to play seven matches in three weeks like we did before.”
