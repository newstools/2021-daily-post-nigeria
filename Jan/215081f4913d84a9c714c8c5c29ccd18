The Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP) has mocked former Service Chiefs for always claiming victory against Boko Haram on the pages of newspapers. The body said President Muhammadu Buhari did the right thing by removing them. The news of their replacement lifted the spirits of Nigerian soldiers. In a statement on Wednesday, CNPP Secretary General, Willy Ezugwu, urged the new military heads to inject fresh ideas into the war against insurgency and criminality. “The former security chiefs obviously failed to live up to their calling and preferred winning the war against insurgency on pages of the newspapers than in the battle field. “We urge the new security bosses to ensure that ordinary citizens, especially the farmers, can go about their lawful activities in all parts of the country without fear of insurgent or killer herdsmen. “The life of every Nigerian matters and should be accounted for at any time as it is the primary responsibility of the government to protect the lives and property of Nigerians”, it read. CNPP expressed confidence that morale of officers and men had been restored, adding that this would translate to successes against enemies of the state.
