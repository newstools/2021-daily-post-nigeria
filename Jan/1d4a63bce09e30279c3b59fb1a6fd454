Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has revealed why he is struggling at Emirates this season. Aubameyang signed a new deal with Arsenal in the summer but has yet to recapture his previous stunning form for the Gunners this season. The 31-year-old has only managed three Premier League goals in 15 appearances so far this season for Mikel Arteta’s side. But Aubameyang is now saying that he’s struggling because it was part of football, adding that he and his teammates gave a lot at the end of last season to win the FA Cup and to qualify for the Europa League. Speaking ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Crystal
Palace on Thursday, Aubameyang told Sky Sports, “From the beginning of this season I was struggling a lot, but I think this is part of football. “We gave a lot at the end of the season to win the FA Cup and to qualify for the Europa League because it was really important for the club. “Sometimes you’ve ups and downs, and you’ve to manage as best you can. I tried my best, and until now it wasn’t the best performance from me.” “I am still positive. I think I can turn this around,” the Gabonese striker added. “It is really hard to manage both, but you’ve to be as positive as you can because the team needs you. “I always try to give my best, not only on the pitch but also in the dressing room for the guys. “Sometimes it is hard, and maybe you aren’t in the right mood, but you’ve to find a way to change it and give positive vibes for the guys.”
