United States’ president-elect, Joe Biden, has maintained that politicians cannot seize power in the country, because power has to be given by the people. “In America, politicians can’t assert, take, or seize power. It has to be given by the American people. We can’t ever give that up. “The will of the people must always prevail,” Biden tweeted on Tuesday. The 78-year-old Democratic candidate emerged winner in the November presidential election. Biden’s comment comes as Georgians take to the polls for two closely-watched US Senate runoffs. The polls could shape the first years of the new Democratic presidency. US President, Donald Trump and Biden are in Georgia for the battle of the Senate seats. For nearly 20 years, Georgia had voted reliably Republican in the presidential election and Senate contests.
