Wife of the embattled Managing Director of the First City Monument Bank, Mrs. Hauwa Adam Nuru, has denied reports of seeking to divorce him following the lingering paternity scandal. Reports had emerged online that Hauwa Nuru had decided to divorce her husband following allegations. Recall Mr. Nuru caused controversy in December over allegations that he had an illicit affair with a former staff of FCMB, Moyo Thomas, and fathered her two children while she was still married to her husband, Tunde Thomas. It was alleged that Mr. Thomas died in December from the shock upon discovering that his two children were fathered by Mr. Nuru. However, in a statement released on Saturday, Mrs. Nuru, said the report which circulated online was an attempt to further demonise her ‘beloved husband and a loving father.” Part of the statement read: “I want to clarify for the avoidance of doubt that I am still very much with my husband. She added that “At no time did I contemplate leaving my matrimonial home or filing for divorce as no grounds exist for such.” DAILY POST recalls that FCMB in reaction to the allegations against Mr Nuru revealed that the Bank’s board of directors have begun an investigation of the allegation which it termed unethical.
