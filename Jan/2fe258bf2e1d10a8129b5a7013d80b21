The Presidency on Tuesday said President Muhammadu Buhari changed Service Chiefs because he felt the time was right to rejig the country’s security system. Buhari’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina was reacting to remarks that Buhari replaced the Service Chiefs following calls by Nigerians. Featuring on Channels Television’s Politics Today, Adesina said: “The President knew the time to do it and I believe the time has come and that is why it has been done. “I don’t think it is a matter of right or wrong, it is just a matter of doing what is best for the country at the best time. “It will not be right to say one side was right or one side was wrong because the President even in the statement we issued, also commended the outgoing service chiefs for their contribution to engendering a safer country. “That shows that by and large, he was satisfied with their performances and he just felt it was time to rejig the system; have fresh energy, have fresh blood, have fresh ideas”.
