Former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, is back to Nigeria. The Jagaban, as fondly called, returned to Lagos on Sunday. Tinubu is the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He was away in London for some weeks “on vacation”, according to his camp. Tinubu has not made a comment on the tension in Ondo and Oyo.  There is unease in the South-West states over vacation notices to Fulani herdsmen. Former Senate President Bukola Saraki, in a statement, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to take urgent steps to address the situation. The ex-Kwara State Governor condemned some leaders for keeping quiet despite recent happenings “The deafening silence by key stakeholders, leaders and others who we think should speak out is worrisome. This silence is a dangerous tell-tale sign that things are wrong. “This is not good for our country. We must all speak out and talk about the solution to this twin-problem of insecurity and threat to national unity”, Saraki wrote.
