Zilkifiru Mohammed, the kidnapped son of the Auditor-General of Bauchi State, Alhaji Abdu Usman Aliyu, on Monday, returned home after spending a day with his abductor. The 25-year-old Mohammed was kidnapped Saturday evening together with his father’s friend Iliyasu Suleiman, on the Bauchi-Tafawa Balewa highway after the Auditor-General was attacked and shot by some gunmen in an attempt to kidnap him. Aliyu was attacked and shot on his way to his village, Kardam in Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area of the state while in company with five other people, including three women in his car. The other occupants of the car were said to have run into the bush where the kidnappers were said to have taken two and went away to unknown destinations. A reliable security source, however, informed DAILY POST on Monday afternoon that Mohammed had returned home after he escaped from the kidnappers’ den. The source added that no ransom was paid for his release, saying that, “The Auditor-General son returned home after he escaped from the kidnappers.” The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Ahmed Mohammed Wakili, could not be reached to confirm the development but a top police officer confided in DAILY POST that Mohammed had returned home. The top police officer informed that though Mohammed’s escaped, his father’s friend, Iliyasu Suleiman, was still with the kidnappers, adding that efforts were being made to rescue him safely. A family member had earlier informed that the family had been contacted by the kidnappers, adding that negotiations were ongoing to secure the release of the two victims.
