Harold Bornstein, President Donald Trump’s former personal physician, is dead. Bornstein’s family announced his death in a statement. He is survived by wife Melissa (Brown), daughter Alix, and sons, Robyn Bornstein, Joseph Bornstein, Jeremee, and Jackson. The deceased was Trump’s doctor for more than three decades. Ahead of the 2016 election, Bornstein stated that the President’s “physical strength and stamina are extraordinary”. He added that if elected, Trump “will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” The American leader later dropped Bornstein after he revealed to The New York Times in 2017 that he prescribed hair loss medication. Bornstein wondered why people made a big deal out of a drug to grow hair. “It certainly was not a breach of medical trust to tell somebody they take Propecia to grow their hair. What’s the matter with that?” he told NBC News in 2018.
