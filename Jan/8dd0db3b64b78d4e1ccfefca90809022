Everton manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has described his players as “lazy” and “slow”, following their 2-0 defeat to struggling Newcastle United. Callum Wilson netted twice in the second half, as the Magpies ended their 11-game winless run in all competitions. The result dealt a fresh blow to Everton’s hopes of securing European qualification, as they sit two points adrift of a Champions League place. And Ancelotti was scathing in the assessment of how his team played against Steve Bruce’s side in their fourth home league defeat of the season. “We were lazy. We were slow and we were not focused. We gave away 12 corners to them, a lot of throw-ins. We didn’t win duels, second balls – this is the game. “You can only show quality if you are there in this game because the game is about winning duels, second balls, avoiding corners, avoiding throw-ins. “I am disappointed. I don’t want to forget what we did. “We had a good run and I hope it will only be a game like this,” Ancelotti said.
