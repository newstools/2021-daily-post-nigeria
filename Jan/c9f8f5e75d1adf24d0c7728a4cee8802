The kidnapped spokesperson of the Edo State Command of the Nigerian Immigration Service, Mrs Bridget Esene, has narrated her ordeal in the hands of her abductors after her release. Recall that Mrs Esene was kidnapped by five armed men who trailed her to her church at Ikhueniro, a community in Benin City on Sunday, January 24. Following her kidnap, the Police swung into action to secure her release from her abductors. However, the Spokesperson of the Edo State Police Command, Chidi Nwabuzor, on Tuesday said Mrs Esene was released at about 4 pm. Nwabuzor failed to state if any ransom was paid for her release. Speaking to newsmen, Esene narrated how she was abducted at gunpoint by the kidnappers and sold to another gang. According to her, she was taken to the forest where she was handed over to another set of abductors who took her deeper into the forest. “I was forced into the car and driven out of the church premises by the five gunmen who later sold me to another set of kidnappers who are suspected herdsmen. “The armed men later took me into the forest and some other hardened kidnappers were on ground to receive me. “I was sold to another set of gunmen who then took me deeper into the forest,” she said.
