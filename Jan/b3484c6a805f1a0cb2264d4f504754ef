Manchester United is open to the idea of offering Sergio Ramos a mega two-year deal, according to Calciomercato. Ramos is yet to agree on a contract extension at Real Madrid. The World Cup-winning defender will become a free agent this summer, when his current deal expires. However, Ramos is free to talk to foreign clubs from this month. Paris Saint-Germain is also believed to be keen on signing the 34-year-old. Ramos reportedly warned Los Blancos that PSG wants to create a super-team by signing him and Lionel Messi. Madrid is doing their best to keep their talismanic captain at the Santiago Bernabeu beyond this season.
