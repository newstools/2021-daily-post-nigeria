The Nigerian troops and Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) have invaded four Boko Haram strongholds in Borno on Wednesday. The Operation led by Brig. Gen Waidi Shaibu, Commander of 21 Special Armor Brigade, targeted Boko Haram strongholds in Maiyanki, Darussalam, Bula Kurege and Izza. The camps served as training grounds for the terrorists and hideouts for an ambush of military personnel. Many unit commanders and fighters were killed, while more were injured in the ground assault and aerial strikes. Dozens of equipment were captured; food items, Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) making materials and clothing were destroyed. “We cleared Maiyanki, Darussalam, Bula Kurege and have now taken over Izza, all former Boko Haram strong-points. Troops have been repeatedly attacked in these harbour areas”, a top military source told PRNigeria. “Heavy casualties were inflicted on the enemy. The situation is tough but we are winning. Sadly, a soldier paid the supreme sacrifice and 3 injured. We brought them out. Our resolve and commitment is unshaken.” Some Boko Haram camps were destroyed when the new Chief of Army Staff, Major General Ibrahim Attahiru was the Theatre Commander of Operation Lafiya Dole in 2017. During his brief tenure, Nigerian troops eliminated five top Boko Haram commanders and scores of fighters. In October 2017, Attahiru, at a briefing, listed them as Abdu Kawuri and Abubakar Benishek. They were eliminated in an operation on September 1 at Alafa in Bama LGA. Another three, including Ba’abba Ibrahim, died after a heavy battle with Special Forces in Magumeri LGA.
