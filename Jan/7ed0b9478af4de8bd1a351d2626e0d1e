Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has claimed he is more interested in beating Crystal Palace than the Liverpool vs Manchester United clash on Sunday. City have failed to beat Roy Hodson’s side in the last two seasons. Guardiola’s men lost 3-2 in 2018, thanks to a stunning goal from Andros Townsend. Exactly one year ago, Palace held City to a 2-2 draw at The Etihad. Asked what result he prefers between Liverpool and United at Anfield, Guardiola said: “Crystal Palace. Crystal Palace is the only result I want. “I want to beat them – the rest? Honestly, I don’t care. The last two seasons at home to Palace we got one point. “Two years ago we lost, last season we drew. Our performances in Selhurst Park have been much better than the Etihad Stadium so that’s why the only concern I have is winning against Crystal Palace. “We play them knowing the result between United and Liverpool so, honestly, I don’t know about anything else.”
