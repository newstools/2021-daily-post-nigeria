The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has warned that those extorting National Identification Number (NIN) applicants risk a 7-year jail term. The NIMC gave the warning in a tweet via its Twitter account on Friday. The NIMC said the offence was punishable in accordance with the law, adding that the ongoing enrollment for the National Identification Number (NIN) is free across the country. It also urged Nigerians to report such cases of extortion for prosecution to serve as a lesson to others. ”Nigerians have been asked to report such cases of extortion for prosecution to serve as a lesson to all offenders. ”The punishment for extortion if convicted is seven years of imprisonment as stipulated in Sections 14, 20 and 21 of the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) Act. “However, we urge patriotic Nigerians to report any form of extortion via actu@nimc.gov.ng or call 08157691214 or 08157691071,” the tweet said. Recall that the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) gave telecommunications companies in the country two weeks to block all unregistered SIM cards.
