American rapper, Lil Wayne, has finally expressed gratitude to the former President of the US, Donald Trump for the presidential pardon granted to him. Trump had granted Wayne presidential pardon in his final hours as the US President. Wayne took to his Twitter handle on Thursday to thank the former president for recognising that he has a lot of responsibilities. The music star tweeted: “I want to thank President Trump for recognising that I have so much more to give to my family, my art, and my community. “I also want to thank @bradfordcohen for working so diligently to secure another chance for me. Love!” DAILY POST recalls that Trump issued 73 pardons and commuted the sentences of 70 additional individuals with Wayne on the list in an official White House statement that was released on Tuesday, January 19. Wayne had not yet been sentenced, after pleading guilty last December for carrying a loaded firearm while travelling on a private jet. The 38-year-old is regarded by many contemporaries as one of the most influential hip hop artists of his generation and often cited as one of the greatest rappers of all time.
