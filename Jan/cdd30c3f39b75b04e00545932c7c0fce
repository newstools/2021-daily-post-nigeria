US House of Representatives Speaker, Nancy Pelosi has told President Donald Trump to resign honourably or be impeached. The Speaker said the House is prepared to move ahead with the impeachment plan if President Trump does not resign. In a statement on Friday, the House Speaker, Pelosi said that she has instructed the House Rules Committee to prepare for a meeting to approve a rule that would govern floor debate for an impeachment resolution. Pelosi’s statement said, “Today, the House Democratic Caucus had an hour-long conversation. “It is the hope of Members that the President will immediately resign. But if he does not, I have instructed the Rules Committee to be prepared to move forward with Congressman Jamie Raskin’s 25th Amendment legislation and a motion for impeachment,” Pelosi said. There is a growing call for President Donald Trump to resign after he incited his supporters to attack the US Capitol on Wednesday. President Trump has refused to acknowledge Joe Biden as the winner of the November 3 presidential election and had made the transition process difficult for the incoming government. Four persons were reported dead and 52 arrested after pro-Trump group attacked the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. The protesters attempted to stop the Congress from certifying President-elect, Biden’s victory.
