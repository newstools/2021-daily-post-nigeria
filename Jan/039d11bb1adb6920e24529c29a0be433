The factional leader of the Boko Haram insurgents, Sheikh Abubakar Ibn Al-shakawi popularly called Shekau, has said in a new audio message that, the new set of service chiefs will not do more than what their predecessor did in the fight against terrorism in the northeast Nigeria. The Boko Haram spiritual leader, calls on the chief of defence staff, Lt General Lucky Irabor to have sympathy on himself, repent and convert to Islam. Shekau, who spoke in about ten minutes, also called on the Chief of Army staff, Major General Ibrahim Attahiru that his conducts are un-islamic as such he is no longer regarded as a Muslim. According to Shekau, there is going to be more terror attacks in the country, promising that, the high expectation placed on the new service chiefs will not amount to positive yields and soon Nigerians will know that the appointment of the new service chiefs amounts to nothing as to effect any changes in the operations of the insurgents in the northeast region. Both the new Defence Chief, Lt General Lucky Irabor and the new Chief of Army staff, Major General Ibrahim Attahiru have served in Borno state as theatre commanders of the operation lafiya dole and have made impact during their stewardship. Residents of the state have also expressed confidence that their return in high capacity will step up on the fight against insurgency in the region having operated in the state and know the terrain well. But Abubakar Shekau has promised that, he will make a mess of their positions in the coming days if to proof a point about his operations in the northeast region.
