Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has revealed that goalkeeper Neto asked to leave the club this month. The 31-year-old moved to Nou Camp from Valencia in 2019. Since then, Neto has made just 14 appearances, featuring nine times this season. Reports emerged this week claiming the one-time Brazil international wants to depart Camp Nou and he has been linked with a move to Arsenal. Barca have turned down the shot stopper’s request to leave, however, claiming he is too important to let go. “It’s true that his representative has asked the club for an exit. “We have said no because he is an important goalkeeper for us and we want to be very well covered at each position,” Koeman told reporters on Saturday.
