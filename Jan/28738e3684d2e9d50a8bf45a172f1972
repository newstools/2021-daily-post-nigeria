The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has said schools in the country will resume on January 18, until the Ministry of Education announces further directive. PTF National Coordinator, Dr Sani Aliyu, stated this while featuring on TVC on Tuesday. Just yesterday, the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, said the Federal Government would review the January 18 date which was fixed for resumption of schools across Nigeria. However, Aliyu clarified that Adamu did not say the date has been changed. Aliyu said, “As regards schools, I just want to make a clarification, what the minister said yesterday was that they were going to review, he didn’t say that they were going to change the date. He said they will review the situation and let the nation know. “So, for the moment, it is still 18th January until the Ministry of Education comes back either with an alternative date or reconfirms that.” The PTF Chairman and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, had listed reopening of schools as one of the reasons why COVID-19 numbers have spiked.
