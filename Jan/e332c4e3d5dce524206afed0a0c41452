Frank Ugboma, Oguta constituency representative at the Imo House of Assembly, has condemned the amendment of some portions of the House Rules. Ugboma told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Owerri on Monday that the act was a “flagrant abuse of legislative process”. At the last sitting, Deputy Speaker Amarachi Iwuanyawu (APC Nwangele), moved a motion to relax Order 11 and Rules 61, 62 and 63. “Any member who misbehaves will be suspended for that sitting, if the offence is not considered serious. But where the said offence is considered serious, the offender will be suspended for a period of two weeks”, it read. Ugboma called the amendment an infraction of some sections of the 1999 Constitution that border on fair hearing. The lawmaker stated that all members were entitled to make contributions on the floor of the house. Ugboma wondered why the process of amendment was orally done on point of order. “A point of order is only raised when there is an emergency to that effect but there was no emergency warranting the amendment. It was an orchestrated plan to shut some lawmakers up. “This obnoxious amendment offends all sound logic and it is aimed at discouraging members from demanding their rights”, Ugboma said.
