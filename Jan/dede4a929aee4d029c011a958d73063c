Following the resignation of former service chiefs, the senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa says Nigeria is left with a decision between two evils. Specifically, the cleric described the newly appointed Chief Of Army Staff, Maj Gen. Attahiru and his predecessor, Tukur Yusuf Buratai as lesser evils. In a statement to DAILY POST on Tuesday evening, the Pastor said the change in military leadership was long overdue, adding, “The appointment of the service chiefs is like pouring the same old wines in brand new bottles. “You should be ashamed of yourself commending someone who couldn’t listen to Nigerians in changing his failed service chiefs for five years. “Within the five years, Nigeria’s security architecture has gone from bad to worse. Specifically on the newly appointed Chief Of Army Staff, the choice is between the two evils. “The new evil is better than the old one, nothing will change. It’s very easy to fool Nigerians. Do you think they would give us competent hands that can crush Boko Haram in a minute? “There are young vibrant soldiers who can handle Nigeria’s security effectively, but they can’t allow them to smell the positions.”
