An ex-Governor of Ogun state, Olusegun Osoba, has said the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has the right to contest for the Presidency in 2023. Osoba stated this while appearing on Arise TV on Tuesday morning. “Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as an individual has the right to put himself forward, but we have not zeroed in on an individual. “Zeroing in on any individual will destroy our efforts now. But Tinubu has a right to pursue his own agenda,” he said. Osoba also claimed there is a gentleman’s agreement in the All Progressives Congress (APC), that the next presidential candidate for the party will come from the South. He, however, made it clear that though “there is so much noise from the East”, nobody has contacted anyone in the ruling party to show interest in running in 2023. “As an elder in the party, nobody from the South-East has contacted or consulted me to lobby, to even say they are interested.”
