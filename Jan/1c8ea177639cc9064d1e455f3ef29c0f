As part of its Social Housing Scheme, the Buhari administration will construct 300,000 houses under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) for low income earning Nigerians. A statement on Sunday by presidential spokesman, Laolu Akande, disclosed that cement manufacturers have agreed with the federal government to charge a discount price. During his inspection of the completed model houses in Dei Dei at the weekend, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo affirmed that it was possible to deliver decent and affordable accommodation to Nigerians. After seeing the prototypes of the one-bedroom and two-bedroom bungalows, Osinabjo said he was satisfied with the cost and quality of the design. He thanked cement manufacturers for their contribution to the success of the housing programme. “They have agreed to give cement for this project at a considerable discount which is a very helpful thing to do. We really commend and thank them, it is a very patriotic thing on their part. “Anybody who is earning N30,000 a month and is ready to spend a third of that amount will be able to afford one of these houses. What I have seen so far, there is a one-bedroom unit and there is a two-bedroom unit, both coming under N2 million.” Osinbajo expressed hope that the government will be able to replicate the project not just in Abuja but all over the country.
