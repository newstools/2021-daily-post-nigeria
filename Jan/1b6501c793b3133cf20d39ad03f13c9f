The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says presentation of a valid National Identification Number (NIN) would be compulsory for all categories of vehicle registration from April. Assistant Corps Marshal (ACM), Bisi Kazeem, Corps Public Education Officer, made the announcement in a statement on Saturday. On December 21, 2020, FRSC mandated that all applicants for the National Driver’s Licence must present their NIN before being captured for any class of licence. Kazeem said the commencement was in full compliance with Federal Government’s directives on harmonisation of citizens’ data. “Beginning from the second quarter of this year 2021, If you want to register your vehicle, it is going to be compulsory for you to provide your NIN. “This is part of the security checks. So, once you provide your NIN, it makes the matter easier and helps the government in national planning”, the spokesman noted. FRSC warned that there will be no waivers for anyone, irrespective of their status in the society.
