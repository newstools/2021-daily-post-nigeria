Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has singled out midfielder, Billy Gilmour, for praise following his side’s FA Cup 3-1 victory over Luton Town at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Lampard said Gilmour made things difficult for Luton Town, adding that the Scottish youngster was outstanding against the visitors. Chelsea defeated the Championship side, thanks to Tammy Abraham’s hat-trick. “Playing like he [Billy Gilmour] did today is making it very difficult [not to give him more minutes] because I thought he was outstanding,” Lampard said at post-match after the game. “His comfort on the ball, the way he moved it, his discipline, his personality was great. If he plays like he does today, it makes it very difficult for me not to give him a run. “He trains that way too. “With his youth and the injury he had, and with the difficult run we’ve been on in the last month, it’s been a case of me finding the right time to get Billy in. Today felt like the right time, and he was brilliant. “In the short term for me, looking at things today, he won’t be going out on loan. Of course, we’ll keep that slightly open until the end of the month, but Billy is a Chelsea player and the level he showed highlights today why he is a Chelsea player in the middle of the park.” Chelsea’s next game is against Wolves in the Premier League on Wednesday.
