The capital city of Imo State, Owerri was yesterday thrown into confusion as two girls between the ages of 23 to 25 ran mad at Imo State University roundabout after being dropped off by a suspected yahoo boy. DAILY POST gathered that the suspected yahoo boy drove in a Toyota Camry Spider car. Eyewitnesses said the older lady, after being dropped at the junction, went stark naked and was threatening passersby with a kitchen knife. Recall that same incident had happened at Ikenegbu junction sometime in 2018 when a lady went mad and caused serious traffic gridlock. A bus driver (name withheld) who shared a bit of the story, said it was a tip of the iceberg for the year 2021. He added that many girls are going to be used for rituals in the new year, especially those who are moved by flashy things. He further advised parents and guardians to keep close tabs on their female children to save them from falling victims.
