A member of the House of Representatives, Babatunde Hunpe, has urged Nigerians to throw their weight behind the projected presidential ambition of Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Hunpe, who is a member from Badagry Federal Constituency, said Nigerians should reward Tinubu with the presidency. Speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, the lawmaker said Tinubu should be supported because he has paid his dues. He said: “So, what we should do to reward him now is to support him, if he wants to contest the 2023 presidential election. “We are doing this because of our individual interest, but this is not the best as it cannot take us anywhere. “Tinubu has paid his dues, he has done a lot for this country, and if the man comes out that he wants anything, I want to appeal to all Nigerians to support him.” Hunpe’s remark is coming at a time when the former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of APC had said Tinubu needs to align with other stakeholders from other zones to stand a chance of clinching the party’s presidential ticket.
