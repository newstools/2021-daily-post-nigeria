Arsenal will announce the loan signing of Real Madrid midfielder Martin Odegaard in the coming days, El Confidencial reports. Odegaard is set to leave the LaLiga champions, after making just seven league appearances so far. The 22-year-old will join the Gunners until the end of the season in search of playing time. Arsenal will pay the full amount of Odegaard’s Madrid wages during his time at the Emirates. The player earns £38,000-per-week, wages Arsenal will have no problem paying. However, they will pay a loan fee of just £2m to Madrid, meaning they have very little to lose even if Odegaard does not live up to expectations. It is not believed that there is any clause which would allow Arsenal to sign Odegaard permanently in the summer.
