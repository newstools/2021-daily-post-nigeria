Nigerian Baptist Convention (NBC) has appointed a new president, Israel Akanji. Akanji was the priest-in-charge, First Baptist Church, Garki in Abuja. The cleric takes over from Supo Ayokunle, the current Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) president. Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has urged Akanji to take NBC to greater heights. Makinde commended Ayokunle for the monumental progress recorded under his leadership. He expressed confidence that Akanji, an indigene of Sepeteri in Oyo, would make greater exploits in his new assignment. “This appointment is a testimony to the goodness of God in his life and how far he has come. “It is my prayer that God will continue to uphold the NBC and strengthen it to continue to push the frontiers of the gospel of Christ”, Makinde said.
