The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ibrahim Pantami, has directed the immediate suspension of staff members involved in extortion of applicants at the National Identity Management Commission, NIMC, in Bauchi and Kaduna State offices. Pantami gave the directive following a public outcry that some personnel of NIMC, particularly at some enrollment centres in Bauchi and Kaduna States were capitalizing on the rush for NIN by the public. The Minister stated that the fraudulent activity perpetrated was inimical to the policy directive of the Federal Government.” He pointed out that the policy requires mobile network subscribers to update their SIM registration with a valid National Identification Number (NIN). Pantami’s order was contained in a statement signed by Kayode Adegoke, Head, Corporate Communication of NIMC. He also released toll numbers and emails that members of the public can call when they make contact with fraudulent personnel. The statement quoted Pantami as restating his “zero-tolerance stance on extortion, bribery and corruption and further noted that such unethical practices if allowed to fester and not nipped in the bud by taking stiffer actions against the culprits, has the potency of derailing the SIM-NIN Integration project.” The statement added: “Enrolment for the National Identification Number (NIN) is free of charge, and on no occasion should anyone pay to obtain an enrolment form or to have their biometrics captured. “All personnel involved in the enrolment and NIN issuance exercise must carry out their respective duties professionally, fairly and with integrity. “In light of the above, we wish to call on the general public to assist us in putting our commitments into action by sending proof of any nefarious activity within and around our enrolment centres (snapshot, footage, audio recordings) to 08157691214; 08157691071 or email actu@nimc.gov.ng.”
