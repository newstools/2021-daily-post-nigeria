Yobe State Police Command has said the burial expenses of police officers who died while in service from 2013 to 2014 has been released for payment. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Dungus Abdulkarem made this known in a statement released on Tuesday. “The affected families are to report to the Mechanized Salary Section,(MSS), Damaturu for verification and payment while next of kin are to come along with all relevant documents”, it urged. The Command, however, regretted the delay. Meanwhile, Yobe State Police Command has reunited three rescued Fulani children with their families in Damaturu. The reunion took place at the office of the Commissioner of Youth and Sports. The Commissioner, Bukar Goni on behalf of the Yobe State government presented the family with a token. He then warned parents to always know the whereabouts of their children as the government will not condone any act of negligence, violence and abuse against children. Goni, however, commended the police for their tireless efforts in making Yobe State a better place.
