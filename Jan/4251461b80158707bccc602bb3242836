As the COVID-19 death toll in Kano rose from 17 to 19 in less than two months, the State Government has set up plans to ensure full compliance with protocols and arrest violators. Governor Umar Ganduje who disclosed this on Saturday during a media parley said mobile courts have been created to ensure full compliance. He said the measure became necessary to preserve public safety and ensure full compliance with the Coronavirus prevention protocols. Ganduje said “Very soon we are coming up with mobile courts and Coronavirus marshals of over 1000 youths which will include Police, Civil Defense and other Paramilitary Personnel to help in enforcing the use of face masks and obeying the protocols in the state.” “There could be a public outcry, but public outcry cannot stop a serious government from serving her people. We will not be diverted from what is good for our people. This collaboration will continue between us”. Ganduje also revealed that the government has provided two thousand Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) and one hundred thousand Face Masks to private hospitals in the state. “We are providing you with 2,000 PPEs and 100,000 face masks so that you can take good care of your frontline health workers who always see patients day in day out”. The Governor added that patients who ask for face masks when they visit facilities could easily be provided with one. ”Your frontline health workers are extremely important to all of us. So their personal protection means a lot to all of us.”
