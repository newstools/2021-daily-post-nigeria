The Department of State Services (DSS) has alerted the public about alleged plans by some elements working with external forces to incite religious violence across the country. According to the security alert, the targeted states include Sokoto, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Rivers, Oyo, Lagos and those in the South East. In a statement on Monday, which was signed by its Public Relations Officer, Peter Afunanya, DSS said that part of the plans was to cause inter-religious conflicts as well as use their foot soldiers to attack some worship centres, religious leaders, personalities, key and vulnerable points. “Consequently, Nigerians are advised to be wary of these antics and shun all divisive tendencies aimed at inciting or setting them against one another,” the statement said While the Service pledged to collaborate with sister agencies to ensure that public order is maintained, those hatching these plots are warned to desist from such in the interest of peace, security and development of the country. “However, law-abiding citizens (and residents) are encouraged to report suspected breaches of peace around them to the nearest security agencies,” the statement further added
