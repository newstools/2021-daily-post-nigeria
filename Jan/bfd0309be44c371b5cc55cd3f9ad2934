Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, has said Frank Lampard’s status as a Chelsea legend “remains undiminished” despite his sack. In a statement on the club’s official website, Abramovich thanked Lampard for his work at Stamford Bridge over the last two years. Lampard’s 18-month reign as Blues ended on Monday, when he was sacked by the club. The 42-year-old guided the Blues to a fourth-place finish last season, but was unable to build on that in the first months of the 2020/2021 campaign. Chelsea are currently sitting eight in the Premier League table having lost five of their last eight games. Lampard’s last fixture was a 3-1 win over Luton Town in the FA Cup on Sunday. “On behalf of everyone at the club, the board and personally, I would like to thank Frank for his work as head coach and wish him every success in the future. “He is an important icon of this great club and his status here remains undiminished. He will always be warmly welcomed back at Stamford Bridge,” Abramovich said. Former Paris Saint-Germain manager, Thomas Tuchel, is now the hot favourite to replace Lampard.
