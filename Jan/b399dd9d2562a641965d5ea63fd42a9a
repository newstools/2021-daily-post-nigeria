Four members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Batch “B” Stream II in Taraba have tested positive to COVID-19. They are currently at the Isolation Centre of the state’s Orientation Camp in Jalingo. NYSC camps opened nationwide on Tuesday. DAILY POST gathered that three corps members tested positive on Tuesday during screening. The fourth case was discovered on Wednesday. But the Isolation Centre has no electricity or medication. A source in Taraba confirmed the situation to DAILY POST. The angry citizen complained that the patients have been abandoned since their status was established. “The camp opened yesterday. It is true that four corps members tested positive in the last 24 hours. It is annoying that they were just dumped in an old, dirty room with no electricity. I can confirm that no light or drugs. “From what I heard, the officials said they want to conduct another test before doing anything. What kind of country is this? Why did they open NYSC camps unprepared?!”, the source lamented. Adenike Adeyemi, NYSC Director of Public Relations, could not be reached at press time. The situation again brings to the fore Nigerians’ complaints about the shoddy handling of coronavirus cases by authorities. The federal government and the NYSC management had boasted that measures were in place to handle infections at camps. The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 recently revealed that 731 Batch B corps members tested positive. Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, said the PTF conducted the testing of batch B corps members using RDTs. The SGF disclosed that in 2020, out of 35,419 participants in Batch B stream, 731 tested positive, compared to 108 recorded in Batch A.
