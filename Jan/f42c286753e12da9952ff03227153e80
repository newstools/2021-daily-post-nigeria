Manchester United striker, Marcus Rashford, has admitted that Jose Mourinho urged him to be more “savvy” in order to win more penalties for the club. Recently, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp mocked United’s high penalty count, by claiming that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side had been awarded more spot-kicks in the last two years than his team. Since Solskjaer replaced Mourinho in December 2018, United have been given 42 penalties while Liverpool have gotten 19 in all competitions. But Rashford has revealed that Mourinho encouraged him to change the way he approached situations after receiving contact in the opposition’s area. “I remember when Jose was manager, there were five or six times I can remember where I should have had a penalty. “Jose ended up saying to me, ‘if you are not savvy about the way you do it, then you are not going to give it’. After that, we started to get a few penalties. “It was something that in terms of development you have to learn that and understand it,” Rashford said in an interview with the FWA.
