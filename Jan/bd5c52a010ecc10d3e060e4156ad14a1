The Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, on Friday, disclosed that the Southwest regional security outfit, Amotekun, is ready to collaborate with the military in the area of intelligence gathering. Akeredolu, in a speech to commemorate the Armed Forces day in Akure, said the existing police structure was not sufficient to protect the country, noting that the regional outfit knows the terrains better. Despite the recent reports of extrajudicial killings by members of the Corps, particularly in Oyo state, Akeredolu said the outfit was here to stay. “Amotekun Corps has come to stay. There is also a need for proper policing of every nook and cranny of the country. The regular Nigeria police force cannot do it alone. Other security agencies must step in to secure the country. There must be a collaborative effort. We must all work together. Policing must be technologically aided. We must have state police in this country. “I encourage our armed forces to collaborate with State-based security outfits like the Amotekun Corps. Let us work together. The Amotekun Corps are making sacrifices and they are ready to work with the armed forces. It is very crucial. The Amotekun Corps has local knowledge and are familiar with terrains in the state,” he said.
