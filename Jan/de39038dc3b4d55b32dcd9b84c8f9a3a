One year after the popular Sabo Market, Sagamu was razed by fire, traders have come out in their numbers protesting the refusal of Governor Dapo Abiodun to take actions. DAILY POST reported that traders in the market lost goods worth millions of Naira to an overnight inferno, suspected to have been caused by a power surge. During the time of the incident, Gov Abiodun had visited the scene, with a promise to rebuild the market and provide relief to the affected traders. However, a year after the inferno, the traders have taken to the street, saying the governor has not done beyond demolishing burnt building and clearing debris.  In their scores, the traders stormed the streets of Sagamu, carrying placards with different inscriptions, as they marched to the palace of the Akarigbo of Remo, Oba Babatunde Ajayi. Speaking on behalf of the traders, Oluwakemi Ogunawo, urged the governor to intervene in reconstructing the market before the next rainy season. Ogunawo lamented that the health of many traders at the market was deteriorating as they sell inside the sun and dust. She added that many traders, who had accessed loans, could not pay back as there are no shops to display their wares. “I want to plead to our Governor, Dapo Abiodun. We are appealing to him to help in reconstructing this market for us because many of colleagues in this market have died due to sun and dust,” she said.  Meanwhile, the state Commissioner for Housing, Jagunmolu Omoniyi, has promised to hand over about 200 shops to the traders by May 2021. According to Omoniyi, goverment would begin construction in the market by next week. He disclosed that “the governor and his team have considered and approved the reconstruction of Sabo market, Sagamu.” He, however, maintained that there is the need to follow due process before moving to site.
