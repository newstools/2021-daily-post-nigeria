The Professional Game Match Officials (PGMOL) Board have released a statement after the controversial double incident during Manchester United’s win at Burnley. During the first half at Turf Moor, VAR was called on to check two fouls at once. In a controversial passage of play, VAR was used to check if Burnley defender Robbie Brady should be shown a red card for bringing down Edinson Cavani in a clear goalscoring opportunity. However, the check ended with Luke Shaw being booked for a challenge on Johann Gudmundsson just a few seconds before, which was also checked by the video referee. The PGMOL have now explained their decision and the steps that referee Kevin Friend took. “When the referee was at the screen, he was first shown the challenge by Shaw on Johann Berg Gudmundson. “He determined that this was a foul and was part of the phase of play that led to the challenge by Brady. “The restart was a Burnley free-kick, with Brady’s yellow card rescinded, and a yellow card issued to Shaw,” the statement read in part.
