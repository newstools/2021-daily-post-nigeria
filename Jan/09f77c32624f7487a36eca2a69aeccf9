Former Arsenal midfielder, Jack Wilshere’s new club has been confirmed. According to Sky Sports, Wilshere has agreed to a short-term deal with Bournemouth. The 28-year-old had been training with Bournemouth as he looked to regain fitness after leaving West Ham last year. Wilshere has now impressed Jason Tindall enough for the Bournemouth boss to award him with a short-term contract. The England star had a loan spell down on the south coast during the 2016-17 season, making 27 appearances. He becomes the club’s first January signing and a deal is expected to be signed within the next 48 hours.
