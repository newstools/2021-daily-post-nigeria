Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, a former President of Nigeria has provided some reasons restructuring the country may just be a waste of time. Jonathan noted that though restructuring the country will bring about some benefits but elites must de-emphasize issues that divide the people among religious, tribal and political lines. Jonathan pointed out that nepotism, ethnicity and lack of patriotism are among issues that must be tackled squarely before restructuring. He said, “We cannot restructure without solving issues that polarize us which are nepotism, ethnic and religious differences and lack of patriotism,” Jonathan said at a media dialogue in Abuja on Thursday. Jonathan further noted that the discussion on restructuring will not help the country except citizens restructure their minds. “From Independence, the struggle was that politics was based on regions and there was this tension,” he added. He lamented that the battle of who will produce the national leaders among religions is still hunting the country till today. “Our conversation in this country is taking the dimension of a baby frog and baby snake. We are making our children hate themselves,” Jonathan warned. The former President, nonetheless, turned down the twin ideas of the one-party system and unitary system of government. “Let me state for the records that I strongly oppose both the philosophy and the idea of a one-party system as well as the unitary system of government. That cannot solve the problem,” he stated.
