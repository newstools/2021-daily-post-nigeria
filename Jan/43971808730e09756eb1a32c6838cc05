President Muhammadu Buhari has reportedly fired Lai Yahaya, his Senior Special Assistant on Planning and Strategy. He worked in the Office of the Chief of Staff. The lawyer guided the presidency on electric power initiatives. Yahaya was accused of leaking internal State House information to an online newspaper. The former aide was sanctioned over a story which fingered Bolaji, the son of Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari. The energy consultant previously worked at the State House, under late Chief of Staff Abba Kyari, until 2017. After his initial exit, Yahaya served as an adviser to Kenya’s Raila Odinga, African Union High Representative for Infrastructure Development. Weeks into office, Gambari recalled him to the presidency as an adviser on power infrastructure. Yahaya, who was Deputy Director to three Directors General at the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), has reportedly left the country.
