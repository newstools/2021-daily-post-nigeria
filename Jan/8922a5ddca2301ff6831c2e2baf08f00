A five-year-old boy from Egbu in Owerri North council area of Imo state who had been missing for some days has been found dead. DAILY POST reports that the dead body was discovered in an abandoned car in his father’s residential home at Egbu where it had decomposed. According to a source, the lad was sent to buy sachet water at a particular compound in the neighbourhood and never came back home. The source further said, “his corpse was eventually found on the fifth day in the same compound where he was sent to buy sachet water. The development got everyone confused as to how he would get electrocuted in a car that has been abandoned for years.” The Imo police spokesman, Orlando Ikeokwu confirmed the death of the child when he spoke to our state correspondent. Ikeokwu also disclosed that the couple who sell provisions at the compound has been arrested and the matter transferred to the state police command for further investigation.
