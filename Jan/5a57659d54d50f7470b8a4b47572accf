Jack Ma, the famous Chinese billionaire is suspected missing. Ma, 56, is the founder of e-commerce giant, Alibaba. Yahoo Finance reports that Ma has not been seen in public since ten weeks. His last disappearance was on October 24, 2020, when he called for economic reform in a speech in Shanghai. “Today’s financial system is the legacy of the Industrial Age. We must set up a new one for the next generation and young people. We must reform the current system”, he said. Ma’s Alibaba and Ant Group came under a Chinese government probe after the speech, Yahoo Finance added. The mogul, worth an estimated $58.4billion, has donated millions of dollars to fight against coronavirus. He also made pledges for vaccine development. In November, Ma was expected at the finale episode of his show “Africa’s Business Heroes,” a competition for African entrepreneurs, but an Alibaba executive represented him.
