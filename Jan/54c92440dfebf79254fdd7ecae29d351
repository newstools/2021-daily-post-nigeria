Former Premier League referee, has again hit out at Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, insisting that he knows too well what he is doing when it comes to mind games. Clattenburg had cited his recent remarks about Manchester United’s penalty record as a subtle effort to influence proceedings. Klopp fired back and denied using such tactics. But Clattenburg, writing in the Daily Mail, revealed he has been in Klopp’s eye line before a game in the past. He said: “Jurgen Klopp says he does not have the skills for mind games “So that will be the same Klopp who stands and stares at the opposition warming up before the game? “He knows what he’s doing, he’s incredibly smart. It is why he’s one of the best managers we’ve had in the Premier League. “Klopp once tried to stare me out before a match. That’s fine, he has a presence and an aura that he uses for the benefit of his team.”
