Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has promised that work will commence on the Umuaru-Nenu Road in Obingwa LGA of the State in the next seven days. The Governor made the promise while speaking at the thanksgiving service organized by the Abia State representative at the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission, RMAFC, Dr Chris Akomas, on Sunday. The Governor called on the youths of Nenu to support the contractor that will handle the project and ensure that the job was not obstructed in any way. Ikpeazu commended Dr Chris Akomas for his friendship and support and promised to continue to support him in bringing development to his people. He urged the people of Nenu not to despair but to always trust and obey God for good things that come their way, assuring that more good things will come to the community. Also speaking, Dr Chris Akomas said that the thanksgiving service was his own way of thanking God for the opportunity given the Governor to serve as the first Governor of Ngwa extraction and for saving his life from the rampaging coronavirus. He prayed God to continue to guide and protect Governor Ikpeazu and give him the needed wisdom and strength to continue to lead Abia in the right direction.
