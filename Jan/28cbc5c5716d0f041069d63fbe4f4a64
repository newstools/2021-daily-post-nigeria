Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has reiterated that he has no hand in the land dispute between Ugondo community of Makurdi and Gwer East Local Government Areas and the Nigerian Air Force. The Governor in a statement on Friday stressed that he has not at any time taken land belonging to the people of Ugondo and handed it to Nigerian Air Force. He said the issue of land conflict between the Nigerian Air Force and Ugondo began long before he became Governor of the State. According to him, he only attempted to amicably resolve the matter by holding a series of peace meetings with stakeholders in the dispute, but when the matter was taken to court, he called the leaders, elders and chiefs and told them that he had withdrawn from the negotiation. He emphasized that even while he was mediating in the land dispute, he only appealed for a peaceful resolution of the matter and at no time imposed his opinion on the two parties. The Governor reaffirmed his commitment to fairness, equity and justice in running affairs of the State and once more appreciates Benue people for the support given him to succeed.
