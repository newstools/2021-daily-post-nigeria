Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has slammed forwards, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, following the Red Devils’ Premier League 2-1 defeat to Sheffield United on Wednesday night. Ferdinand said Rashford and Martial were both invisible against Sheffield United, adding that the pair didn’t create anything for Man United against the visitors during the encounter. Sheffield United defeated Man United at Old Trafford, thanks to two goals from Kean Bryan and Oliver Burke. Harry Maguire did score a goal for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men. “They [Manchester United] didn’t have that zip about them,” Ferdinand told BT Sport. “From minute one, really, there wasn’t that cut and thrust from United where they are cutting through teams. Credit again to Chris Wilder’s team, he set them up defensively very well. “But Man United did not ask the questions. Bruno Fernandes, who they have relied on so heavily in recent months, did not get it going today. Paul Pogba the same. “Rashford and Martial were invisible tonight really. Didn’t get on the end of anything, didn’t create anything. “If anybody was starting to get carried away at Old Trafford in the position they are in at the moment, the reality check was tonight.” Manchester United will now face Arsenal in their next Premier League game at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday afternoon.
