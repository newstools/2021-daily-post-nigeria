The First City Monument Bank (FCMB), on Wednesday, named Mrs. Yemisi Edun as the Acting Managing Director of the bank in the interim. This is following the news of the alleged affair between its Managing Director, Adam Nuru, and one of its former staff identified as Moyo Thomas, which caused controversy online. The announcement was contained in a statement signed by the FCMB management on its Twitter handle. “In line with normal corporate practice, Edun is Acting as the Managing Director of FCMB in the interim period, while Mr Adam Nuru is on leave. “She has not been appointed as the substantive Managing Director,” the statement read. DAILY POST recalls that FCMB in reaction to the allegations against Mr Nuru said the Bank’s board of directors have begun an investigation of the allegation which it termed unethical. It said even though the matter remains personal, the tragedy of the death of Mr Tunde Thomas and the allegations of unethical conduct, require the Bank’s board to conduct a review of what transpired.
