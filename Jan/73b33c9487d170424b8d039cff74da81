Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho has vowed that Fulani herdsmen must be chased out of Yoruba land. He was reacting to the order given by the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, for his arrest. Igboho had last week giving the Fulani residing and doing business in Igangan, Ibarapa North Local Government of Oyo State a 7-day ultimatum to leave the area. And a week later, he made good his threat when he and his supporters stormed the area insisting that the Fulani must leave the town. A Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu told the BBC yesterday that the Inspector General of Police, IGP Mohammed had ordered the arrest of Igboho for giving quit notice to Fulani herdsmen. But in series of tweets on Saturday night, Igboho recalled some instances where the herdsmen had killed and maimed and destroyed property without the government ordering their arrests. He tweeted: “And it’s not a crime to Kill doctor akorede? whose farm was invaded and destroyed by Fulani cows, later went to Seriki Fulani house to lay complain, but was tied and butchered and nothing happened? “This one we have started here in Oyo State will not end here. We are going to other parts of the South-West. Tell herdsmen in Ekiti State, Ondo State and Osun states; in fact, in all South-West states that we are coming. “This is not about politics, money or fame but the freedom of Yoruba nation from the killer Fulani herdsmen. “FG did not order the Inspector general of Police to find and arrest the killer of Dr Aborode, Oko Oloyu and other prominent Yoruba elites kidnapped at Ibarapa Oyo state but they are planning to arrest me. Let’s see how it goes. “We are taking back our land from all these Fulani herdsmen terrorising us. May God help us.”
