The Zamfara State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Abudu Yaro, has directed the Special Constabulary Personnel to desist from wearing uniform, saying that they are not police officers but are Police informants. The commissioner gave the instruction during a tour of Police Divisional Stations in Bungudu and Tsafe Local Government Areas of the state, pointing out that the Constabulary Police has only one duty to perform which is intelligence gathering. The state police boss assured the motivation of the Special Constabulary Police, charging all Divisional Police Officers to repost all the constabularies back to their villages to monitor and observe their respective areas for adequate and proper intelligence gathering. “They were not employed as full police and uniformed officers but were engaged to supply the police with timely and vital information about armed bandits ravaging the entire state,” he lamented. The Zamfara State police boss further warned them against any form of extortion in the course of discharging their legitimate responsibility.
