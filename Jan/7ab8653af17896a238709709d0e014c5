Lionel Messi will receive a huge cash windfall from Barcelona in bonuses even if he departs this summer, Marca reports. The 33-year-old’s future is still uncertain and it looks as if he will finally quit the Nou Camp. In December, Messi admitted the club were in a “really bad situation” with “no money” to reinvest in the squad. A candidate in the upcoming presidential election, Emi Rousaud, also claimed Messi’s current salary was “unsustainable” and Barcelona couldn’t afford to pay him the same rate going forward. But it is understood they are still set to be hit in the pocket whether the Argentine remains at the club or not. It is claimed Messi is in line to receive another €39million (£34.8m) at the end of the current season. The fee is one half of a €78m bonus agreed when Messi signed his last contract in 2017, that came with a €100m wage rise. He had already cashed in the other €39m installment. But rather than the money coming in one lump sum, the agreement will see Messi receive it in eight separate payments over four years. That means Barcelona could still be paying Messi in 2025.
