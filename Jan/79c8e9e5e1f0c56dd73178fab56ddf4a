New Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, on Wednesday night failed to win his first game in charge of the club. Tuchel saw his new Chelsea team played a 0-0 draw against Wolves in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge. Recall that the former Paris Saint-Germain coach was appointed as Chelsea manager on Tuesday following the sacking of Frank Lampard on Monday. The German fielded the likes of Mendy, Azpilicueta, Silva, Rudiger, Chilwell, Jorginho, Kovacic, Hudson-Odoi,Ziyech, Havertz and Giroud in his starting XI against Wolves. The former Dortmund gaffer only made three changes (Abraham, Pulisic and Mount) during the encounter against the visitors. His team dominated possession and had 14 shots but failed to find the back of the net against Wolves. Tuchel will now hope to win his first game for Chelsea when they face Burnley on Sunday in their next fixture.
