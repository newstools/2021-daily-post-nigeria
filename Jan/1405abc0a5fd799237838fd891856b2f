Real Madrid midfielder, Martin Odegaard, has made a decision on his future amid transfer interest from Arsenal, Marca reports. Gunners boss, Mikel Arteta, is keen on the 22-year-old as he tries to add more creativity to his squad. Odegaard is desperate for more minutes on the pitch, after making just 11 first-team appearances for Los Blancos. The Norwegian has also been sent out on loan three times since joining the LaLiga giants in 2015. Arteta remained tight-lipped when asked on Thursday about Arsenalâ€™s interest in Odegaard. But it now believed Odegaard would prefer a return to Real Sociedad after thriving with the Spanish club last season. Madrid and Sociedad are in talks over the possibility of another loan deal for the Norway international. Odegaard was a regular at the Anoeta Stadium, scoring seven goals and posting nine assists in 36 appearances last term.
