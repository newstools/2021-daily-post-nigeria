Former Manchester United star, Roy Keane, has said that Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard is running out of time at Stamford Bridge. Lampard saw Chelsea slip to eighth on the Premier League log after a 3-1 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday The Blues performed woefully on Sunday as the defeat continued a concerning run of form for the Stamford Bridge outfit. Lampard spent more than £200 million on new recruits last raising expectations of the club’s supporters in 2020-21. “Frank will be concerned for what he saw,” Keane told Sky Sports. “I don’t think Frank’s going to get much time. There’s huge pressure this year, you have to give players time to settle coming from foreign countries,” Keane added. “Chelsea don’t give managers time. It’s in their DNA and history not to give them time. “Last year he had a free pass, but they’ve spent money and it brings added pressures, no matter who the manager is. “Every team has injury problems; he’s got to get ready. He won’t get the time Klopp got.”
