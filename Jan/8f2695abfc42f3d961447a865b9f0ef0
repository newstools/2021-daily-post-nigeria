The All Progressives Congress (APC) has condemned recent events in the United States and President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede defeat. The APC stated its position on Saturday in a statement by John Akpan Udoedehe, Secretary of its Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee. Nigeria’s ruling party said over time, elections in America had been used as a reference in other democracies. The scribe noted that strong institutions are fundamental to the sustenance of democracies. “This U.S. election saga strongly underscores the fact that the integrity of the country’s leader essentially complements the workings of these institutions. “President Muhammadu Buhari contested and lost elections a couple of times and followed the process through to the Supreme Court on all accounts. This is an outstanding credential of a true democrat.” Udoedehe recalled that the APC contested elections, won some, lost some without splitting hairs. The secretary added that at some point, it lost more than five states to the PDP, yet allowed democracy to prevail. He said the APC had remained resolute in its belief that in every electoral contest, the popular will of the people must prevail.
