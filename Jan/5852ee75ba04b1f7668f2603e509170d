It’s no longer news that the foundation for the change of guard at the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps headquarters has been laid with the retirement of the Commandant General, Alhaji Abdullahi Gana Muhammadu, as the Corps’ helmsman bowed out of office on the 17th January, 2021, at the expiration of the 6 months tenure extension granted him by the President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, at the expiration of his tenure of 5 years. Alhaji Abdullahi Gana Muhammadu, was appointed the second substantive Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, following the retirement of Dr. Ade Abolurin, OFR, from office on the 17th July, 2015. What is news however, is the intrigues and power play that have become the hallmarks of the process of selecting a substantive Commandant General for the Corps, which the law provides should be on the recommendation of the Honourable Minister of Interior/ Chairman, Civil Defence, Correctional, Fire and Immigration Services Board, upon the recommendation of the Board, after screening and qualifying examinations have been undertaken and qualified officers ascertained. It is noteworthy that the Civil Defence, Correctional, Fire and Immigration Services Board, in consideration of its statutory mandate, supervised by the Honourable Minister of Interior, Engr. Rauf Aregbesola, has already made a recommendation to President Muhammadu Buhari, on suitable candidates, for one of them to be appointed as Commandant General of the Civil Defence Corps. As this all-important job of appointing a helmsman for the Corps delays, the outgone Commandant-General and his lieutenants who didn’t make it through the stringent selection process put in place by the Minister of Interior, and the Board, have made a beaten path to all available top politician, to subvert the recommendation of the Board/Minister of Interior, already on the table of the President for approval. To put an end to the intrigues and mudslinging that have become the hallmarks of the search for the next Commandant-General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, President Muhammadu Buhari, needs to rise up to the occasion, consider and appoint a Commandant-General for the Civil Defence Corps, in line with extant laws, rules and regulations, guiding the operation of the Corps and its service Board. The bulk stops on the table of President Muhammadu Buhari, whose duty is to approve the appointment of a new Commandant-General for the Civil Defence Corps, with the urgency it requires, as the Corps remains a key security agency in the fight against the rising security challenges in Nigeria.
