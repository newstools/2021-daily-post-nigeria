Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has insisted he will never walk away from the club. Ahead of this Sunday’s home clash against Manchester City, Lampard says he embraces the pressure that comes after a £200 million spending spree. Having earned legend status at Stamford Bridge as a player, a relatively inexperienced coach is aware of the expectation that exists in west London. Last season, Lampard led Chelsea to the FA Cup final and a top-four-finish. But this year, a title challenge is being talked up by many. Lampard told reporters after seeing his side take just four points from their last five Premier League fixtures: “I enjoy pressure. If I didn’t enjoy it I would not have got back into this, or I would walk away at the first chance, and that’s never ever going to be something that I would do. “The first person that puts pressure on me is me. I do that all the time, for good and for bad. “I take it on. I don’t mind it. That’s how I am. Maybe my wife will tell you how I react to pressure better than I do. But I don’t kick the dog!”
