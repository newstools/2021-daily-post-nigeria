The Nigeria Police has given details on the death of Assistant Inspector-General (AIG) of police in charge of Zone 8, Lokoja, Mr Yunana Babas. The Acting Public Relations officer for the zone, Inspector Ruth Awi, speaking to newsmen in Lokoja on Friday, said that Babas, who was due for retirement in two weeks time, died suddenly at the Federal Medical Centre, Lokoja. She revealed that the late AIG was in the office on Wednesday, Jan. 13, to attend to his official duty up till afternoon and later left for his house without any sign of illness. According to her, Babas later sent for the zone’s photographer to come to his house and take some photographs. The photographer, however, returned to the office later, informing us that he could not take any photograph because the AIG took ill suddenly. Based on this, we paid him a visit immediately and took him to the police clinic at the New Layout area in Lokoja. She said that the health of the AIG instead of improving started deteriorating, a development which made them to rush him to the Federal Medical Centre, Lokoja. “We were all outside praying and hoping that he would come out when the news filtered out that the AIG has passed on ,” Awi said.
