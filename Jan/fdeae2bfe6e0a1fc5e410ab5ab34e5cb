Sunday Adeyemo, a youth leader, who is popularly known as Sunday Igboho, has explained why he wants Fulani herdsmen to leave Oyo State. Last week, Igboho led some youths to the Sarkin Fulani of Oyo state, Saliu Abdulkadir, to register their displeasure over the recent killings in the area. He blamed the attacks and kidnappings on herdsmen and gave them a 7-day ultimatum to vacate Oyo. Makinde, however, countered Igboho, saying his administration will not accept issuance of ultimatums for any group of persons to leave Oyo. However, Igboho ignored Makinde and stormed Ibarapa with his supporters on Friday to effect the eviction notice. Speaking with BBC Yoruba, Igboho said: “They are saying I am not in government and that I am meddling with what does not concern me. If there is a government and it is not doing what it is supposed to do, the people that voted will rise up,” Igboho said. “It’s not like I commanded the Fulani to leave our land or that I suddenly said something arbitrarily. For like two weeks now, these Fulani people in Ibarapa have been killing our people. “Look at this Doctor Fatai, who went abroad for many years to work; he made his money, came back to his father’s village in Igangan, built farms and employed people to work with him. Fulani people ate the farm for him, he approached the Seriki of the Fulani that this ought not to be, and they killed him there.”
