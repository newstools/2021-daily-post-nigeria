Former CNN presenter, Larry King, has been hospitalized after testing positive for the dreaded coronavirus. A statement released by his family said the 87-year-old has been hospitalized at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. According to the statement, King has been hospitalized for more than a week, and is in intensive care due to the fact that he also has Type 2 diabetes. “Larry has fought so many health issues in the last few years and he is fighting this one hard too, he’s a champ,” the statement added. In 2017, King revealed he had been diagnosed with lung cancer and successfully underwent surgery to treat it. King hosted CNN’s “Larry King Live” for 25 years, interviewing presidential candidates, celebrities, athletes, movie stars and everyday people. He retired in 2010.
