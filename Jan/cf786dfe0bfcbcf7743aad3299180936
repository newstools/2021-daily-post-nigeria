Former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for sacking the Service Chiefs. Buhari on Tuesday announced the sack of the Service Chiefs. His Special Adviser on Media and Publicity Femi Adesina said the President appointed Maj Gen LEO Irabor, CDS, Maj Gen I Attahiru, Army, Rear Adm AZ Gambo, Navy, AVM IO Alao, Air Force as new security chiefs. Reacting, Fayose on his Twitter page urged the new Service Chiefs to learn from their immediate predecessors and remember nothing lasts forever. He also called on the International Criminal Court, ICC to investigate the sacked Service Chief for human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings. ”It is my call to the ICC and other relevant authorities that tenure of the “sacked” Service Chiefs should be investigated, most importantly human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings under their watch and commands. ”The sacked Service Chiefs only served themselves and their pockets and can at best be described as “Disservice Chiefs” under whom Nigeria became completely insecure. ”Though coming after persistent pressure from Nigerians, President Buhari’s removal of the Service Chiefs and their replacement is a right step in the right direction. It is yet another victory for the people of Nigeria.”
