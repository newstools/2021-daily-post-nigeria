The Premier League on Wednesday confirmed it will try the use of concussion substitutes during matches. However, no date for it to be implemented has been announced. This comes amid growing concerns about the impact of head injuries and ball heading in football. The new law, when implemented, will see teams make up to two changes in a match for players who have suffered or are suspected of having a concussion. These substitutions will be added to the three substitutions currently allowed in Premier League fixtures and teams will be allowed to sub a player with concussion even if they have already made all their regulation changes. “Premier League shareholders today formally agreed to introduce the International Football Association Board’s (IFAB) additional permanent concussion substitutions trial. “The trial will be confirmed when the implementation of the reporting processes, including private medical information, has been resolved with IFAB and FIFA. “With player welfare the Premier League’s priority, the protocols will allow a maximum of two concussion substitutes to be used per team, with the opposition side able to use the equivalent number,” a Premier League statement read in part.
