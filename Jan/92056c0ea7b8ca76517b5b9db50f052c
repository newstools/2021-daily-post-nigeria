Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, has raised an alarm over the reopening of schools amid the COVID-19 second wave. Sani said there is confusion over how government should tackle the second wave of COVID-19. The former lawmaker, in a tweet, said state governments should pay more attention in ensuring adherence to COVID-19 measures and not the Federal Government. He tweeted: “Reopening schools and other #COVID19 regulatory measures should be a matter for the states and not the FG; the 36 states, including FCT have different infection rates. There is evident confusion on how to tackle the second wave.” Schools across the country have been scheduled to resume today, Monday, despite the COVID-19 resurgence. The federal government fixed the date, even as it continues to deal with the second wave of COVID-19. The resumption has caused fear among some Nigerians.
