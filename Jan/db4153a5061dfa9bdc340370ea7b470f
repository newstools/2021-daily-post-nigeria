About 400 members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have dumped the party for the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Ubakala, Umuahia South Local Government Area of the state. The defectors were led by the APC Vice Chairmanship candidate in the December 18th 2020 LG poll held across the state, including executive members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Speaking on behalf of the PDP decampees during the declaration ceremony in Umuahia South LGA, on Thursday, Comrade Ifeanyi Duke, expressed joy they joined the ruling PDP in the state. He explained that they were motivated to join PDP because of the massive infrastructural development executed by Governor Okezie Ikpeazu-led administration, as well as the excellent performance of the Secretary to the State Government, Barrister Chris Ezem. Duke, however, promised that they would work with PDP to ensure that the party moves head. However, in separate speeches while receiving the APC decampees, Hon. Jerry Uzosike, representing Umuahia South State constituency in Abia House of Assembly and the Executive Chairman, Umuahia South Local Government Area, Engr Humphrey Chukwudi Benson, welcomed the defectors and promised to work with them, as well as carry them along. The PDP leaders commended them for the bold step and described their defection from APC to PDP as symbolic.
