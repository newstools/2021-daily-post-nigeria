Nollywood Actor, Uche Maduagwu has called on the US President, Joe Biden, to place sanctions on the Nigerian government over the 2014 anti-gay law, alleging that 40% of the current lawmakers and over twelve governors are homosexuals. The law was signed by ex-President, Goodluck Jonathan and it prohibits all forms of gay relationships in Nigeria. The law also states that a 14-year jail term awaits anyone caught in an act of homosexuality. However, Uche in a post via his Instagram account asked President Biden to sanction the Nigerian government over the law. He also alleged that 40% of the current lawmakers and 12 state governors are homosexuals but are hiding behind closed doors. “Dear President Joe Biden. I am proudly gay, and I beg you to place sanctions on Nigerian government for its inhuman laws against law-abiding homosexuals. “This same government pampers wicked Fulani herdsmen who kidnap and cause trouble in southern part of Nigeria. “We are tired and scared despite the fact that more than 40% of current legislatures and over twelve governors are homosexuals in naija; why the hypocrisy,” he said. Recall that the Controversial Nollywood actor, recently revealed that he is gay. Maduagwu made the declaration via his Instagram page on Thursday, asking his followers to learn to accept and respect other people’s choices.
