Paris Saint-Germain boss, Mauricio Pochettino, has said that he was ‘proud’ after winning his first trophy at the club on Wednesday night. Pochettino won his first trophy as a PSG manager on Wednesday night following his side’s 2-1 win over Marseille in the Trophée des Champions final. Two goals from Mauro Icardi and Neymar gave PSG the victory over Marseille. Dimitri Payet did score a late consolation goal for Marseille. “I’m really proud, and I’m feeling really good,” Pochettino was quoted by PSG’s official website as saying after the match. “I want to congratulate the players and say thank you to them and to Paris Saint-Germain, to Nasser the president and Leonardo the sporting director for trusting us and giving us the possibility to fight for big things and trophies. “Yes I am so happy, and it was a very special night for us to have beaten our opponents and of course to win the trophy.” PSG’s next fixture is against Angers in the Ligue 1 on Saturday.
