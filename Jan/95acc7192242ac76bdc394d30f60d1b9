Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers were on Friday killed in a heavy gun exchange with soldiers in Ondo State. With four soldiers said to be wounded during the gun duel which happened on the busy Owo/Ifon road in Ose Local Government Area of the state, the kidnappers were alleged to have laid siege on the highway before the arrival of the soldiers. According to a source, some road users who were on transit through the highway had been held hostage by the kidnappers. The source added that the troops who were on patrol ran into the barricade of the kidnappers on the road while the gunmen opened fire on them and the soldiers responded immediately. The soldiers were said to be careful in exchanging gunfire with the kidnappers in order not to kill some of the victims who had been held hostage by the kidnappers but four of the kidnappers were reportedly shot dead during the heavy gun duel. The source, however, said four of the military men who sustained gunshot wounds during the exchange of fire were rushed to the Federal Medical Centre, FMC, Owo for medical attention. Following the incident, the Owo/Ifon axis of the road was immediately deserted by motorists as well as residents of the area due to the heavy gun shots. While confirming the incident, spokesperson of the Nigeria Police in the state, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro, said men from the command had been drafted to comb the forest in order to apprehend other fleeing suspected kidnappers.
