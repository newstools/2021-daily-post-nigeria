US President-elect, Joe Biden, has warned President Donald Trump that he is not above the law. Biden stated this in a tweet on Saturday night. “Our president is not above the law. “Justice serves the people — it doesn’t protect the powerful,” Biden wrote. This also comes amid reports that Trump is considering pardoning himself. Trump will be out of office on January 20, the day Biden will assume power. It is believed Trump is discussing the issue of clemency with his aides. Between December 22 and 24, 2020, he approved scores of pardons, including to allies convicted for criminal offences. The President is reportedly weighing both the legal and political implication of a self-pardon.
