Dr Ifegbike Kalu of the Federal Medical Centre Makurdi, Benue State, on Monday said government should order schools to operate on shift basis, amid the surge in cases of COVID-19. Recall that following Federal Government’s directive, schools resumed today in most states of the Federation despite the spike in cases of coronavirus. The resumption had caused fears among Nigerians over the possibility of COVID-19 spread. However, Dr Kalu in a chat with DAILY POST said government should apply the same approach used for religious centres on schools. According to Kalu: “I think it’s a two sword approach. If government says students should stay at home while other activities are going on, this same students will still go to church and markets. So it depends on what you want to achieve. “But if you are looking at reducing community transmission, then pushing resumption date is in line to two or three months like the House of Representatives said. “Government has not been serious with this whole thing. You see government asking people to go and register for NIN and that is worse than schools reopening. “You see government functionaries involved in all kinds of ceremonies, considering this, you will note that students have stayed at home for too long so if schools are shut down while other events are going on, then it’s not fair. “If government wants to be serious, then they should direct students to attend schools in batches so that the place is not crowded. “I have not seen anything that they are doing, government is not working, they are just suggesting schools should resume while nothing is working fine. “Schools can resume in bits same way churches were asked to start services.”
