The Governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu has formally flagged off the construction of the Umuaro-Nenu road in Obingwa Local Government Area of the state. Governor Ikpeazu speaking while flagging off the road, said the road will be extended to 10 kilometres to link Akwa Ibom State, pointing out that the road has tremendous economic value as neighbouring States of Akwa Ibom and Cross River would now have access to markets in the area and beyond. He promised that the road will stand the test of time when constructed, assuring that the contractor will not leave the site until the job is completed. Ikpeazu urged the contractor to do a quality job and enjoined the people of Nenu community to support the contractor to realize the project.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862244" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FB_IMG_1610103046328.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FB_IMG_1610103046328.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FB_IMG_1610103046328-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> The Commissioner for Works, Bob Chiedozie Ogu said the 6.5 kilometres road will be expeditiously worked on, assuring that the road will enhance the quality of life of the people of the Mgboko Umuanunu Ancient Kingdom, Obingwa and Abia State as a whole.
