Dino Melaye, former senator representing Kogi West, has urged Nigerians not to rejoice over the appointment of new service chiefs. President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, appointed new service chiefs after several calls for sack of previous ones owing to increasing insecurity in the country. The new service chiefs are: Major-General Leo Irabor as Chief of Defence Staff; Air Vice Marshal Isiaka Oladayo Amao ss Chief of Air Staff; Rear Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo as Chief of Naval Staff; and General Ibrahim Attahiru as Chief of Army Staff. Reacting, Melaye urged Nigerians to be very observant and not rejoice over the appointments yet. On his Twitter page, the former Senator wrote: “Do not shout Hallelujah or Alhamdulilihi for the locomotive announcement of new service chiefs. Not Uhuru yet. Shine your eyes Nigerians.” Meanwhile, Femi Adesina, Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Buhari, said that the resignation of the service chiefs was not as a result of a number of security failures under their tenure. According to him, President Buhari just felt it was the best time to remove the security heads and appoint new ones.
