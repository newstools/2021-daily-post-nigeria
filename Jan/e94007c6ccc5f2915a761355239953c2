US President, Donald Trump, has insisted that there will be an orderly transition of power on January 20, 2021. He said this in a statement after a joint session of the US Congress declared President-elect, Joe Biden of the Democratic Party as the country’s President. Trump, who refused to condemn the violent protests at the US Capitol building in Washington DC on Wednesday, said he didn’t agree with the election result but would step down peacefully. “Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless, there will be an orderly transition on January 20,” Trump’s statement read. “I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it’s only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again.”
