A candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC in the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State, Dr Chidozie Nwankwo has said that most aspirants to the governorship seat are out of jobs. Nwankwo, the CEO of Wichtech said some of those seeking the governorship position were either out of jobs or seeking for greater employment. He said their joblessness was the reason they are contesting for the position. â€œThose are not the kind of people Anambra needs now. What Anambra needs are people who have a vision and are ready to drive the state to excellence. Chidozie added that if Anambra were a football club, his type of players were sought after and signed by a club in heavy sums to enhance their performance. The businessman stated that left for him alone, he would not leave his business to vie for the governorship position but added that he was being propelled by a divine calling, urging him to seek a position, for the liberation of the state.
