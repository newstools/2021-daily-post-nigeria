US Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell has finally made his position known on President Donald Trump’s action that led to the attack on US Capitol. President Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives last Wednesday after being accused of inciting his supporters to carry out the attack that led to death of some people. Most Republicans have refused to publicly blame Trump and McConnell, has said little to defend the outgoing president since the riots. However, he took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to place blame squarely on Trump, according to Politico. “The mob was fed lies,” McConnell said. “They were provoked by the president and other powerful people. “And they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like. But we pressed on.” Ten Republicans joined House Democrats to vote to impeach Trump last week on a charge of incitement of insurrection. The article of impeachment is expected to be sent to the Senate to initiate Trump’s trial but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not said when it will be sent.
