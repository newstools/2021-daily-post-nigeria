Barcelona defender, Jordi Alba, has admitted he’s one of the most hated players. However, the Spaniard insists his off-the-field attitude is very different to his on-field persona. Alba has made over 360 appearances for Barca since he joined from Valencia in 2012. During that time, Alba has won LaLiga five times and a Champions League title in 2014/2015. However, he believes that he is hated by those he plays against due to his combative style. “It is clear that if people know me through football, they would think I’m one of the most hated players in football. That is clear,” he told Movistar+. “It’s my way of playing and it is what has led me to be the player I am today and to be where I am. “Other people know me by how I am, as a very humble person that values everything in my life.”
