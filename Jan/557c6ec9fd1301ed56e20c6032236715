Nnamdi kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has warned that no part of Biafra land will be surrendered to the Fulani. Kanu stated this while reacting to the report of Benue State government rejecting the proposed installation of one Bala Bello Muhammad as Sarduana Otukpo. DAILY POST had reported that the Benue state government rejected the proposed installation of Muhammad as Sarduana Otukpo. The state Deputy Governor, Engr. Benson Abounu, said he had reached out to the Leader of Hausa Community Otukpo, Alhaji Mamuda and informed him that there is nothing like Sardauna Otukpo in the Benue State Chieftaincy Laws of 2016. He also directed Alhaji Mamuda to call off the intended coronation which he accepted to comply with. Reacting to this, Nnamdi kanu claimed that many tribes in the country had forcibly lost their territories to the Fulani, adding that their next target is Otukpo, in Benue State. “Yoruba lost Illorin, Hausa lost Gobir (present day Sokoto), Nupe lost Bida, Attah of Igala was forcibly converted to Islam with some of his people, Oturkpo will be the next to fall to the relentless march of the [Fulani] as some of you continue to ignorantly mouth your One #Nigeria gibberish or Igbo presidency,” Kanu wrote on his Facebook page. “…Some elements from these Fulani conquered… [areas] are busy helping their conquerors to conquer Biafraland. How pathetic! “I have news for all of you agents of Fulani … in the south, no inch of Biafran territory will be surrendered to your masters from the Sahel. “…In Biafraland we would rather all die that cede our ancestral lands to savages.”
