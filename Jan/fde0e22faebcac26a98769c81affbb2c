Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has warned Bruno Fernandes not to allow his temper get the better of him. Fernandes was fortunate to have escaped punishment during their 0-0 draw with Arsenal on Saturday. The Portugal international was fortunate to still be on the pitch, after he raked his studs down the back of Granit Xhaka’s Achilles’. Moments earlier, Fernandes had been angered by a challenge from Cedric Soares that caught him in the face. But Solskjaer admits the midfielder’s reaction could have had serious repercussions. “He’s a winner of course just got to watch it so it doesn’t boil over little bit of a stamp on Xhaka,” Solskjaer said in his post-match press conference. “But that’s Bruno, he wants to win, he wants to tackle. “He’s a clean player, he wants to win, and he almost won it with a shot over the bar when he nipped inside David Luiz, so unlucky.”
