Manchester United striker, Edinson Cavani has accepted the three-game ban slammed on him by the Football Association, for an Instagram post made in November. However, the 33-year-old has reiterated his innocence. Cavani was handed the suspension and a £100,000 fine, after the FA adjudged that a post containing “Gracias negrito” brought the game into disrepute. The Uruguay striker chose not to challenge the FA’s decision. However, he has now broken his silence since the punishment was announced. “Hello everyone, I do not want to extend much in this uncomfortable moment for me. “I want to share with you that I accept the disciplinary sanction knowing that I am foreign to English language customs, but I do not share the point of view,” Cavani posted on Instagram. Cavani will now miss matches against Aston Villa, Manchester City and Watford.
