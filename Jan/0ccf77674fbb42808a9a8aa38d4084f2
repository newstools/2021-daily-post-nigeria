The Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, has said it has lost faith in President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. ACF National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Waye made the remark while expressing sadness over the killings witnessed across the country. Speaking on Channels Television, Waye lamented that Buhari has failed to curb insecurity in Nigeria. Waye said the abduction of students of the Government Science Secondary School, GSSS, in Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina State was an indication that the president has performed poorly in the area of security. According to Waye: “We are very very depressed. We are very sad in the ACF. Nobody is happy because of what has been happening to our people. “How can I have faith in someone who presides over this kind of thing? I had faith in him when I followed him as a reporter and he chased away some foreigners who were coming to kill us. “When he was coming to be President, I had faith in him. I witnessed how successful this man was in chasing enemies out of our country in 1983. But now, 300 people kidnapped in his home state.”
