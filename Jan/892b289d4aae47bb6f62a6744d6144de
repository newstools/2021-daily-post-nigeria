The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has confirmed that bandits attacked officers in Kaduna State on Friday. Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, in a statement on Sunday disclosed that the personnel were attached to Police Mobile Force – 9 Squadron, Kano. He noted that the team was returning to their base in Kano after completing an Operation Puff Adder duty in Niger State. They were ambushed along the Birnin-Gwari Funtua Highway. Mba denied the kidnapping of 18 officers, and insisted only 16 were waylaid. The spokesman said the personnel “successfully repelled the attack and neutralised the bandits”, while others scampered into the bush “with gunshot injuries”. “Regrettably, four of the officers paid the supreme price during the exchange while an officer is still missing,” he said. Mba said the remaining 11, led by their Unit Commander, successfully recovered the bodies and firearms of fallen colleagues. The statement added that efforts were being intensified to rescue the missing officer.
