Zamfara State Governor, Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle has ordered the emir of Maradun to within three days produce the outlawed Yansakai members who slaughtered two Fulani herdsmen in the state. The governor gave the order at the government house when he held a meeting with the traditional leaders and stakeholders in the state. Matawalle disclosed that while holding the meeting, someone sent him a text saying two innocent Fulani herdsmen have been slaughtered by the members of the outlawed Yansakai group. He then warned that anywhere bandits or members of the outlawed Yansakai group kill people, the Emir of that area will be dethroned. “You can not claim to be closer to the grassroots, yet you don’t know what is happening in your domain” the governor lamented.
