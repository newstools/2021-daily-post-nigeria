The All Progressives Congress (APC) has insisted that terrorists no longer control any part of Nigeria’s territory. The party advised Nigerians to stop politicising security issues. John Akpan Udo-Edehe, Secretary, APC Caretaker Committee, made the call in a statement on Friday. The scribe noted that apart from attacks on soft targets, Boko Haram and its affiliates had been degraded. Udo-Edehe said efforts of security services, particularly the Armed Forces, to keep the country safe, should be appreciated. “We should rather support their efforts to further degrade the capacity of terrorists and other criminal elements. “We invite Nigerians to rededicate themselves to the patriotic call contained in our National Anthem – ‘The labours of our heroes past, shall never be in vain.” January 15 the day set aside to honour military veterans, those who fought and died in the nation’s civil war and internal operations. Being a former British colony, Nigeria formerly observed November 11 as Poppy Day in honour of the end of the First World War. After the government’s victory over Biafran troops on January 15, 1970, the day was moved off the Commonwealth of Nations calendar.
