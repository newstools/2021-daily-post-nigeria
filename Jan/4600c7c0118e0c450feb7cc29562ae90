The Auxiliary Bishop of Owerri Catholic Archdiocese, Most Rev. Chikwe Moses, alongside his driver, who were kidnapped last Sunday, have been freed unhurt. DAILY POST reports that the prelate and his driver were released from the hands of their abductors on Friday night after series of prayers and fasting embarked upon by the Catholic faithful in the State. Recall that the traditional rulers of Ikeduru local government area led by the chairman, HRH Eze Marcel Okwadikesinachi Egemonu, a few days ago took to the streets demanding for his (Bishopâ€™s) immediate release. The monarchs rained several curses on the captors of the prelate and poured libations at the ancestral junction (Amanwaozuzu) in registering their grievances. Meanwhile, members of the Roman Catholic in the State and Imo people at large are in joyous mood when they received the news. Chikwe Moses is the Auxiliary Bishop of Owerri Catholic Archdiocese and will soon be confirmed as the substantive Bishop of the province.
