United States President-elect Joe Biden has reiterated his condemnation of the invasion of the US Capitol on Wednesday. President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol Building as Vice President Mike Pence was about to perform his role in the electoral vote count. The edifice is the meeting place of the House of Representatives and the Senate. On Thursday, Biden stated that it would have been a different case if the attackers were Black people. “No one can tell me that if that had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn’t have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol”, he said. Thousands of Trump’s followers clashed with the police as they re-echoed his claims of election fraud. Four people died in the violent protest which started after the American leader vowed “never to concede”. Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader, has called for his immediate impeachment. The President’s ex-ally and former Attorney-General, William Barr, said Trump orchestrated the mob action. Barr added that it was “a betrayal of his office and supporters”.
