Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has said that his counterpart at Manchester United, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is happier than him (Guardiola) The victory over Aston Villa at the weekend sent United level on points with league-leaders Liverpool. On the other hand, Guardiola’s City heads to Chelsea on Sunday hoping to close the gap between them and Manchester United. Manchester City will follow up their trip to Chelsea with a trip to Old Trafford on Wednesday for a one-off Carabao Cup semi-final tie with United. “I am pretty sure Ole is happier than me – but I am not concerned too much about United,” Guardiola told his post-match press conference. If United are there it is because they deserve it. “Before I landed here people said that the real Premier League is where everyone can lose to everyone. I didn’t see it until now. “Now is the first time I see that one team is able to lose or win by seven then after that draw. The results are unpredictable.”
