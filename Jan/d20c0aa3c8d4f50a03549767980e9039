The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah has taken a swipe at corrupt officials in Nigeria. The cleric lambasted them during the wake mass for Archbishop Peter Yariyock Jatau at St. Joseph’s Catholic Cathedral in Kaduna. His sermon was titled, “A Nation in Search of Its Soul”. Kukah said citizens usually complain that the country is full of churches and mosques but cannot find the values of religions in their leaders. “We sin at home by stealing the nation’s resources but we seek repentance and forgiveness in Saudi Arabia and Jerusalem in the guise of lesser or higher pilgrimages,” Arise News quoted him as saying. The National Peace Committee member likened Nigeria to the proverbial farmer searching for his black goat because darkness is setting in. “Our nation has become one huge waste land, huge debris of the deceit, lies, treachery, double dealing and duplicity. Nigerian politicians have turned our politics into a huge trojan horse, a hoax, a hall of guile and dissimulation,” he said. Kukah warned that general frustration was on the rise and evident in domestic violence and inter-communal conflicts. “A combination of all these has turned us unto a nation at war with itself,” the Bishop stated.
