Leicester City vs Chelsea: Lampard gives injury updates ahead of EPL clash Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has confirmed Andreas Christensen is available for the game against Leicester City on Tuesday. However, N’Golo Kante is not yet fit enough to feature at the King Power Stadium. Third-placed Leicester will fancy their chances against an out-of-form Chelsea side, who trail them by six points in the table. Under-pressure Lampard has been sweating over the fitness of several first-team players, with Christensen, Kante and Reece James all missing recent games. Christensen has missed the Blues’ last three matches against Manchester City, Morecambe and Fulham due to a minor knee problem and the 24-year-old defender only returned to training last week. It appears the Denmark defender could play a part away to Leicester, but Kante is still struggling with a niggling hamstring injury. “Christensen is available and unfortunately N’Golo isn’t,” Lampard said at his pre-match press conference on Monday. “His hamstring is not ready so they are the ones of note.”
