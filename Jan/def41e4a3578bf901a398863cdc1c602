Nigerian troops put up a fight late Friday as Boko Haram and Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters stormed an army facility at Marte town, Borno State. The insurgents were said to have overrun the base. But the troops, it was gathered, “tactically withdrew” for reinforcement. They returned and neutralized many of the invaders. The military said Ground and Air Force repelled the terrorists. Brigadier General Bernard Onyeuko, acting Director Defence Media Operations, confirmed the attack. He noted that troops of Operation TURA TAKAIBANGO in conjunction with the Air Task Force Operation LAFIYA DOLE destroyed 7 Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists’ gun trucks. Onyeuko said they decimated “several terrorists when they attempted to attack their location at the outskirts of Marte”. The soldiers, based on reliable information about the attack, positioned themselves “in an ambush site where they tactically withdrew to”, his statement read. The military said they awaited the arrival of the enemies before opening fire. Onyeuko added that the troops “are still engaged in pursuit of fleeing terrorists for further exploitation”.
