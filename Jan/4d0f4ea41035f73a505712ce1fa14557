President Muhammadu Buhari has mourned the passing of Mrs Ezinne Janet Nwachi Ohaa (JP). She was the matriarch of the Ohaa family of Amangwu Autonomous Community of Enugu State. Buhari condoled with one of the children, Chinyeaka Ohaa, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Power. He described the deceased as an epitome of humility, a devoted Christian and a loving mother, whose belief in the dignity of labour stood her out within the community. “The early loss of her husband notwithstanding, Mrs. Ohaa weathered the vicissitudes of life to impart positive values and bring up her children to enviable heights.” Buhari urged the children to emulate her attributes, sustain her legacies and take solace in the fact that she lived a fulfilled life. The President further prayed for the repose of Mrs. Ezinne’s soul.
