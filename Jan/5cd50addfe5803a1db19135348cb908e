Kano State Government has confirmed the reduction of workers’ November and December salaries. Muhammed Garba, Commissioner for Information, said it was a temporary measure. In a statement, Garba explained that it was caused by the drop in federal allocation and dwindling internally generated revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He noted that the deduction was necessary to keep the government going, in the face of prevailing economic recession. The commissioner said the deduction was to avoid paying half salary, in batches or layoff of civil servants. The government assured that as soon as the state of affairs improves, it will not hesitate to pay workers their full salary. Garba solicited the cooperation of the workforce “to bear with the situation and desist from spreading rumours”.
