Former Premier League referee, Mark Clattenburg, has called Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp a “hypocrite”, for claiming that Manchester United have received more favourable penalty decisions this season. Following his side’s 1-0 defeat to Southampton earlier this month, Klopp was frustrated at two penalty calls that did not go their way. “I hear now that Manchester United had more penalties in two years than I had in five-and-a-half-years,” he said. Since Solskjaer arrived at Old Trafford in December 2018, the Red Devils have been awarded 42 penalties in comparison to Liverpool’s 19 in all competitions. But Clattenburg, who took charge of 292 Premier League games during his career as a referee, has accused Klopp of playing “mind games” ahead of Liverpool’s fixture against the league leaders at Anfield this Sunday. “Let’s be clear: there is no conspiracy on the part of the referees and officials,” Clattenburg wrote in his column for MailOnline. “Was Klopp insinuating there is? Or was he suggesting United have players who are encouraged to dive? If his intention was the former, then I’ve got no time for that. It simply is not true. “He sounds like a hypocrite if he is suggesting United’s players are looking to win penalties. The likes of Mo Salah and Mane are just as capable of employing similar tactics.”
