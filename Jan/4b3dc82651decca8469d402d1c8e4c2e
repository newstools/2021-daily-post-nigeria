The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) has lost Modupe Oremule, a defence correspondent. Oremule, a mother of 2, died after a brief illness. She was 36 years old. The reporter was laid to rest on Thursday at the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Cemetery, Redemption Camp. The burial organised by the RCCG Akute, Lagos, was attended by Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) members, relatives, friends and colleagues. Presiding Cleric, Pastor Akin Onimole said her corpse showed that everyone has an appointment with death some day. “We are not praying that we die young like Dupe, but when death shall come, where is the last place you shall go?”, he quipped. NUJ Chairman, Lagos Council, Adeleye Ajayi called Oremule’s demise a tragedy. He described the deceased as a humble, respectful and diligent person. “I advise all of us left behind to concentrate on our health, do regular medical checkups and pray to God to keep sparing our lives,” Ajayi said. The husband, Adesanya Oremule, disclosed that his late wife worked hard for the family. “I pray I will be able to achieve all we had planned together and more for our children. When we meet again in heaven, I will be able to gist her everything,” he said in tears.
