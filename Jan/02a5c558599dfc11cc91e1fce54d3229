The All Progressives Congress, APC, in Kano State, has confirmed the swapping of 13 accused screened drug-addicted aspiring Councillors in this month’s local government election. The state party’s Secretary, Alhaji Sarina, said a local government chairman contestant was, however, cleared after he was certified by a competent medical doctor to go for the contest. This is even as the party presented flags to its candidates ahead of the local government council election scheduled for January 16. The event took place at the Sani Abacha Stadium, Kofar Mata, with multitude of APC supporters in attendance. Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, assisted by the APC State Chairman, Abdullahi Abbas, presented flags to 44 chairmanship candidates and 484 councilorship candidates. The governor said he was optimistic the APC will emerge victorious at the polls. Party chairman (Abbas) asked the flag bearers to intensify campaigns at the grassroots until the election is held. He boasted the APC will sweep all the seats. The APC had insisted it would not field drug-addicted candidates for the council poll. The ruling party had, through the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), conducted tests on the candidates. It was gathered 13 councilorship candidates tested positive of substance abuse. The APC Secretary, Ibrahim Zakari Sarina, who spoke to journalists shortly after the event, said the 13 councilorship candidates who tested positive to drug abuse were replaced.
