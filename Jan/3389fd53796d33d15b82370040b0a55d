Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has singled out midfielder, Paul Pogba, for praise after the France international scored a goal in the Red Devils’ Premier League 2-1 victory over Fulham on Wednesday night. Ferdinand described Pogba’s performance against Fulham as fantastic. The former defender explained that Pogba was the big difference during the encounter at Craven Cottage. Pogba and Edinson Cavani’s goals gave Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side all three points against Fulham. “Today he [Paul Pogba] put in a fantastic performance,” Ferdinand told BT Sport. “The big difference recently is he’s been playing quicker. He’s quick with what he’s doing, the efficiency is top, top drawer. “He is a magnificent footballer, and when he’s in this form, he’s one of the best.” Man United’s next game is against Liverpool in the FA Cup this weekend.
