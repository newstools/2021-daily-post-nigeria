There was pandemonium in Ilaro, the headquarters of Yewa South Local Government, Ogun State as a truck belonging to Dangote Group reportedly crushed a student to death. The incident happened Friday at Sabo junction, inbound Owode road at about 1pm. The Dangote truck loaded with cement was burnt beyond recognition by irate students, the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE) confirmed to DAILY POST. It was gathered that the driver lost control and knocked down the dead student, whose body has been deposited at the motuary in Ilaro General Hospital. “Students trooped out in numbers and set the said truck on fire. They also insisted that fire fighters should not put off the fire and as a result of that, they vandalised the fire fighters’ truck that came to put out the fire,” TRACE spokesman, Babatunde Akinbiyi said. Normalcy has since been restored to the affected area, it was learnt. DAILY POST reports that two persons were killed in Yewa North last week Friday by another Dangote truck, which was also set on fire. Dangote truck arrested with 600 bags of smuggled rice in Ogun
