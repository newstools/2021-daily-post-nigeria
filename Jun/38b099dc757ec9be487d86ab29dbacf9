The Bayelsa State police command has arrested a 49-year-old man, identified as Akpoviri Vincent Jimmy, who falsely claimed to be a licensed medical doctor seeking jobs in Bayelsa and Delta States. The command’s spokesperson, SP Asinim Butswat, said the suspect had been going around seeking jobs and claiming to be Dr. Charles Umeh, a serving medical doctor in Taraba State. Butswat said the scheme of the suspect who hails from Ethiope West LGA of Delta State was first exposed in Ughelli when he failed to know the correct terminologies a qualified medical doctor should know and use. During interrogation, the suspect disclosed that he is a graduate of Psychology from the Delta State University. He, however, said he got some knowledge of medicine while working as a P.A to the late Dr Ajoke in Sapele, which was why he carried out such activities. He added that he had not worked as a medical doctor before and only started parading himself as one recently by using his friend’s name, Dr Charles Umeh, without his knowledge.
