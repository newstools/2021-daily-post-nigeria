Controversial Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi has advised the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government on a step to take with the Indigenous People of Biafra. Gumi urged the Federal Government to negotiate with the Nnamdi Kanu-led IPOB group. Speaking with DAILY POST, the Kaduna-based cleric said the government should be frank in negotiating with the Kanu led group. According to Gumi: “Government should try to be frank and engage even with IPOB’s people. Government should call them ‘you come and sit down let’s talk, what is your problem’. Boko Haram kidnapped Greenfield students not bandits – Sheik Gumi “Government should call them for a dialogue; see nobody doubts Nigeria. The problem is that the government is not being considerate even with these herdsmen.” Kanu and his group have been advocating for the actualization of Biafra. They anchored their agitation on the alleged marginalization of the Southeast by the government. Recall that former presidential candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP), Prof. Kingsley Moghalu, had called on the Federal Government to discuss with Kanu and other secessionists in the country. Moghalu insisted that Kanu and other secessionists in the country do not posses a threat to Nigeria’s unity. The former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, however, said Buhari’s lopsided appointment and fair treatment of Fulani herdsmen was responsible for the division in the country.
