Roma manager, Jose Mourinho, has joked that he wants Cristiano Ronaldo to leave Italy, so he can have peace. Mourinho will be coaching in Serie A next season, following his sack at Tottenham Hotspur in April. He will replace Paulo Fonseca at Roma and is likely to come up against his compatriot Ronaldo in Serie A. Both men have worked together at Real Madrid and Mourinho is very aware of the threat Ronaldo carries. “He should leave Italy now and leave me in peace!” Mourinho joked in an interview with talkSPORT. “Everybody says, and I say the same, he is not 25 any more. He is 36 and he doesn’t score 50 goals, but how many did he score? The record is [still] incredible, the numbers speak by themselves.” Ronaldo turns 37 next season, but scored 29 times in Serie A last season. However, his future is up in the air after Juve narrowly missed out on Champions League football. Champions League: Maybe Bellingham is lying about being 17 years – Guardiola
