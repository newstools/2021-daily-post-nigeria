Former Anambra State governor, Mr Peter Obi, has admonished members of the Association of People Living with Sickle Cell Disorder not to see their condition as a death sentence. Obi stated this during a Catholic mass on Monday at Madonna Catholic Church, Agulu, Anambra State to commemorate the World Sickle Cell Day with members of the association. The former governor explained that more efforts need to be made in creating awareness of the scourge of sickle cell disorder so as to stamp it out of society. He noted that the scourge is an avoidable pain, which if intending couples are well informed and guided, would be forestalled. Sickle Cell: Government tasked to sensitize citizens “Sickle cell disease is not death sentence, so you must not see yourselves as already dead, instead always adhere to doctors prescription and avoid hard drugs. “If you carefully manage your health, I’m sure you can live well and long enough too. Do not let anyone see you as people who should be pitied, rather seek to develop yourselves.” Obi introduced them to a pain management professional, the Founder of Las Vegas Pain Institute Dr Godwin Maduka, who is also a gubernatorial aspirant in Anambra State who promised to render his assistance when needed. The National Coordinator of the Association of People Living with Sickle Cell Disorder (APLWSCD), Mrs Aisha Edwards, explained that this year’s International Sickle Cell Day afforded them the opportunity to mourn their members who had fallen under the weight of the painful disorder. Edwards stated that they decided to organize the funeral mass because most of them were not given beffiting burials at death, due to the stigma attached to the disorder.
