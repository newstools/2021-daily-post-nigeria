Roberto Mancini’s side also equaled their longest ever unbeaten run of 30 straight games, a record dating back to the late 1930s after their win over Wales. Their success has been built on a sturdy defense that has seen them fail to concede a goal in their last 11 matches. The Azzuri will hope that Ciro Immobile can extend his hot goalscoring streak after finding the net in each of his last three appearances for Italy Kickoff:8 PM (WAT) Denmark win over Wales, odds 2.00 The recent head-to-head record between the two teams favours Denmark who have won two of their last three encounters since 2000. Denmark will be looking to invoke the spirits of 1992 when they won the European Championship, beating Germany 2-0 in the final. Kasper Hjulmand’s side made history by becoming the first team in the European Championship to proceed out of the Group Stages after losing their opening two games. Wales will be without Ethan Ampadu who was handed red card in the final group stage clash against Italy. Kickoff: 5 PM (WAT) MOZZART BET, make you hammer!
