The Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore has urged the Federal Government to use maximum force on Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Saleh Alhassan, the Secretary-General of the Association made the appeal while describing Kanu as a terrorist. Alhassan said the IPOB leader was an enemy and a rebel against Nigeria. He commended the Nigerian security agents for rearresting and detaining the IPOB leader. Alhassan said Kanu should be prosecuted for allegedly causing the deaths of security agents and innocent Nigerians. “He is a terrorist. He’s an enemy of the state. Is he not a terrorist? How are open grazing and Nnamdi Kanu related? Is there a relationship between a terrorist attacking government institutions and open grazing in the South-East? IPOB is a proscribed organisation. “A terrorist always has a mission to terrorise people. How can someone be defending his territories inside a sovereign state? Is that not a rebel? And, a rebel is an enemy of the state. “The state should apply maximum force on him. They should not waste time with long trials. They should prosecute him for the killing of policemen, killing of innocent people, and destroying means of livelihood,” he told SaharaReporters. Governors turned herdsmen into bandits – Miyetti Allah
