Chelsea has explained why the club extended the contracts of Olivier Giroud and Thiago Silva. The reigning Champions League winners extended both Giroud and Silva’s contracts by a year on Friday. Giroud’s current deal was due to expire at the end of this campaign, but an extension means the Frenchman’s three-and-a-half-year stay at Stamford continues for another year. Chelsea also exercised an option to extend Silva’s contract by one year, taking his time at the west London club into a second season. Chelsea striker, Olivier Giroud’s new club revealed Explaining why Chelsea extended both players’ contracts, the club’s Director, Marina Granovskaia, told Chelsea’s website: “Olivier has been such a crucial part of so many big moments for this club, from his contribution to our FA Cup victory in 2018 to scoring 11 goals on the way to winning the Europa League in 2019. “He has continued to score significant goals, and we will never forget his effort against Atletico Madrid on the way to winning the Champions League this season. “With so much to still to play for, there was only one decision we could make when we exercised the option to extend his contract back in April.” On Silva, Granovskaia added: “When we brought Thiago Silva in last summer, we knew we were adding a world-class player to the squad. Thiago has duly shown everyone at Chelsea his immense quality throughout this season, and he has had a huge influence on and off the pitch for us. “We said when he signed that we hoped Thiago would add new trophies to his impressive list of honours, and he has done just that with our success in the Champions League this weekend. We now hope that he carries on in exactly the same fashion in the coming year.” Transfer: Giroud welcome to join me at AC Milan – Ibrahimovic
