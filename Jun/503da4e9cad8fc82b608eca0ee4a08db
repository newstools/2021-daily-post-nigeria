Former Ekiti State Governor, Ayo Fayose, has reacted following Twitter’s decision to delete President Buhari’s tweet about the civil war. Recall that Nigerians had called for the suspension of President Buhari’s account for saying ‘individuals or groups who wants to destroy his government will be treated in a language they will understand. Following the development, on Wednesday Twitter deleted the comment, saying it violated its rules. Reacting, Fayose in a tweet via his Twitter account said ‘those exercising President Buhari’s powers for him do not know when & where to stop’. He then alleged that Buhari couldn’t ‘operate an Android phone’ talk more of making genocidal tweets. “It is obvious that those exercising President Buhari’s powers for him do not know when & where to stop their power-madness.” Fayose wrote on Twitter on Wednesday evening. “Regrettable, Twitter may not know that the President isn’t the one operating the handle. He can’t even operate Android Phone not to talk of making genocidal tweets,” he wrote. Buhari’s threat: Rulers of Nigeria will account to International community – Nnamdi Kanu commends Twiter
