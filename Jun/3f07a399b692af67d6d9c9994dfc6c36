The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Saturday, said the shutting down of Twitter in Nigeria has exposed President Muhammadu Buhari’s agenda to Islamize tbe country. IPOB said the Twitter ban in Nigeria confirmed that Nigeria was under “hostage by Islamic fundamentalists and terror apologists.” In a statement by its spokesman, Emma Powerful, the seperatist group described Buhari as a tyrant. According to IPOB: “This wicked action of the Fulani-controlled federal government is nothing but a confirmation that Nigeria is under hostage by Islamic fundamentalists and terror apologists. “This is further proof that Buhari is a tyrant and dictator whose only agenda is how to Fulanis and Islamise Nigeria. “The tyrant Buhari was not the only President to be sanctioned by Twitter for posting hate speech but none of them ever shut down the platform in their country. As powerful as the former US President Donald Trump was, he never ordered the pulling down of Twitter platform from the US when the social media giant suspended his account.” The Nigerian Government yesterday announced the suspension of Twitter for aiding secessionists. Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture had said some Nigerians were using Twitter platforms to carry out activities that endangers the country’s unity. Mohammed had disclosed this during a press conference in Abuja. Insecurity: God using Buhari to deal with Nigerians, country can’t be Islamized – Primate Ayodele
