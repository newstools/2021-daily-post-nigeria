Monaco playmaker, Cesc Fabregas, has admitted the arrival of Jorginho sped up his exit from Chelsea. Fabregas left Stamford Bridge in January 2019, ending his five-year stay at the club, as he was deemed surplus to requirements by Maurizio Sarri. The 34-year-old made only six Premier League appearances that season, as Sarri opted for a three-man midfield with Jorginho being the focal point. Fabregas however praised Jorginho ahead of Italy’s 3-0 win over Turkey in their Euro 2020. He said on BBC One: “One of the biggest reasons I left Chelsea is because of him (Jorginho). “He’s a very smart player, intelligent, a very good passer of the ball. The only thing I can say about him sometimes is he releases the ball too quickly when he can play forward. “He makes the team tick.” Champions League: Fabregas rates Kante’s performance as Chelsea failed to beat Real Madrid
