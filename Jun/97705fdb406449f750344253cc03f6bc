The Osun State Government has assured residents of Olopa Estate, Ofatedo, Egbedore local government that it had put measures in place to scale up security to forestall any potential activities of criminals in the area. This assurance followed the alarm that was raised when the community received a notice of intent to rob from an unknown group that demanded N20 million from the community to prevent it from being invaded. The notice has since caused tension in the community, resulting in residents vacating their apartments and business activities being paralysed. In a swift reaction from the Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, the Osun government said it had since reinforced security presence in the area in a bid to guarantee the residents’ safety. The statement which was signed by Egbemode said, “The Special Adviser to the Governor on Security, Mrs Abiodun Ige, and the Member representing Egbedore Constituency in the State House of Assembly, Hon. Babatunde Ibirogba, on behalf of the government, held a meeting with critical stakeholders in the community on improved security measures to protect the area. “Residents of Olopa estate and Ofatedo community have been assured that there will be no breakdown of law and order in the area because of reinforced security presence in the area. “Residents are advised to be vigilant and promptly report any strange movement or presence within the area to the leadership of the community so that security operatives can be quickly alerted. “There is no need to panic, no need to vacate the community for fear of attacks. There is no need to shut down economic activities because of the threat. The administration of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola remains committed to the security of lives and properties of the people of Osun.” Armed robbers write Osun community, demand N20 million
