Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, says the trend where corrupt politicians who join the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC are shielded from prosecution is wrong and should be discouraged. Governor Ortom spoke on Monday at the Benue Peoples House Makurdi when he received the National President Nigeria Civil Service Union, NCSU, Comrade Lawrence Amaechi and his delegation on a courtesy call where he was presented with ‘The Defender and Shepherd of the Masses’ award. He noted that there is no law under the constitution that shields corrupt leaders who are members of the APC from prosecution, stressing that doing so encourages corruption by a government that used fight against corruption as one of the campaign promises to come into power. Governor Ortom lamented that the APC-led administration seems to be the worst in terms of corruption, pointing out that a serving minister who allegedly stole billions of naira was currently being shielded from prosecution. The Governor said he remains committed to the fight for justice, equity and fairness for all, stressing that he chose to remain the mouthpiece of the oppressed and those who have no voice. While noting that no intimidation from any quarters would force Benue people to rescind the ranching law, Governor Ortom said the award would spur him to be more proactive and sensitive to the plight of his people and civil servants. Leader of the delegation, Comrade Amaechi sympathised with Governor Ortom and people of the state over the spate of insecurity and other unfortunate happenings and prayed for its end. He thanked the Governor for appointing one of them, Comrade Ojotu Ojema in his administration and pledged the union’s sustained support, even as he requested that the Governor attends commissioning of the NCSU State secretariat.
