Reacting, Ronaldo, in a post via his Instagram account, on Monday, admitted that Portugal did not get the result they wanted against Belgium. The Juventus forward, however, promised that Portugal would come back stronger. Ronaldo said, “We didn’t get the result we wanted and we left the race sooner than we wanted. But we are proud of our journey, we gave everything to renew the title of European Champions and this group proved that it can still give much joy to the Portuguese. “Our fans were tireless in supporting the team from start to finish. We ran and fought for them, in order to live up to the trust they placed in us. It was not possible to get where we all wanted, but here is our sincere and profound thanks. “Congratulations to Belgium and good luck to all the teams that remain in the competition. As for us, we will come back stronger. Força Portugal!” Euro 2020: Ronaldo, Portugal stars in tears after losing to Belgium
