Former England midfielder, Frank Lampard, has commented on Mason Mount’s performance following the Three Lions’ Euro 2020 1-0 victory against Croatia on Sunday. Lampard, who managed Mount during his time at Derby County and Chelsea respectively, said the midfielder’s performance for England against Croatia was classic. England defeated Croatia at Wembley Stadium, thanks to Manchester City star, Raheem Sterling’s second half goal.

Meanwhile, reacting after the game, Mount said at his post-match press conference, “We were brilliant for the first 20 minutes, but the sun kicked in and we got a bit tired and they have a bit of a ball. “But that is natural because the players they have they are going to dominate some of the ball, and we had to allow that and just shuffle and block. The most important thing is we got the three points.” England will now face Scotland in their next Euro 2020 fixture on Friday.
