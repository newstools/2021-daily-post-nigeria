Traditional rulers of Midim community in Essien Udim Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, have lamented over alleged arrest, intimidation and molestation of innocent persons in the community by security operatives in an attempt to clampdown on the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB The traditional rulers who said they were in support of the government’s directive to sanitise the community of the criminal elements and every form of secessionist move, condemned the way the security operatives are handling the matter. In a press briefing on Sunday, the spokesman of the community, Mr. Victor Udom, expressed worry that security Operatives draw intelligence from a ” biased, mischievous and politically-influenced source adding that such biased intelligence has made the sanitation exercise unsuccessful, leading to arrest and intimidation of innocent people while the real hoodlums are let free. His words, “We acknowledge recent efforts towards sanitizing the State of IPOB/ESN secessionist incursions and other terrorist banditry now taking over our State and we applaud the effort of the Joint Task Force, and other security agencies and we as always will be willing to support this laudable government initiative. CSP, military officers, others killed by hoodlums in Akpabio LG, Essien Udim “We are, however, very concerned that in embarking on this sensitive exercise, the agencies of government instead of involving credible and unbiased critical stakeholders in our community for effective and successful drive, rather chose getting intelligence from a glaringly biased, mischievous and politically influenced source resulting in the attendant near failures in getting the real hoodlums in various communities who are now made to flee in escape while our largely innocent victims or those with minor offences have been wrongly targeted for intimidation, arrest and extrajudicial eliminations as a quid-pro-quo” “We protest in the strongest of terms, the recent takeover of our community, intimidating, indiscriminately arresting, torturing and deliberately implicating our people all in the name of routing members and subscribers to IPOB/ESN and unearthing other criminals by men of the Nigerian Police and Army. ” We condemn all acts of hostage takings, dehumanization and extra judicial killings of innocent people and urge you to intervene to bring all the acts of barbarism not known to law to an immediate end in Midim particularly and Essien Udim in general. He said It was through the efforts of the community that the dreaded Akwa Marine Cult which specialises in raping, kidnapping and rigging of elections results was eliminated adding that ignoring such laudable efforts of the community and turning around to blackmail and intimidate and eliminate them is a conspiracy that should not be over looked. Akwa Ibom: JTF arrests 10 over murder of police officers, recover vehicles, ammunition “We are therefore very displeased that despite our efforts, we are being targeted with some mischievous blackmail as IPOB/ESN secession agitation sympathizers to intimidate us in our continuous engagements against the politically motivated cult gangs that invaded our communities. “This is nothing than a ploy by our politicians to reposition criminal formations in preparation for 2023 upcoming elections” the statement said He said the ongoing politics of framing up and instigating trump up charges on innocent youths of the Community is a strategy aimed at putting them out of circulation ahead of 2023 and one of the hypocrisy of the state government disguised as a security strategy that should worry any patriotic person who wish to see the state remain peaceful and prosperous. However, when the Public Relations Officer of the state police Command, SP Odiko Macdon, was contacted, he said the allegation is false and should be ignored. He said ” How is that true? Of course, this is totally false. These people (security agents) just arrived there a few days ago and who is giving that kind of report?”
