Four pedestrians have been confirmed dead and two others injured after a car hit them around the Adamawa State capital, Yola. An eye witnessess, who described the offending car as moving too fast for a residential neigbourhood, said it hit six women as they tried to cross the Yola Bypass at a community named Sabon Pegi in the Jimeta district of the capital city. One of the witnesses, Abubakar Mahmud, said the incident occurred when the women were returning from a wedding ceremony at a suburb of Yola. ”One of the victims, Aisha was my neighbor of many years. She was very humble and kind to a fault. The fast moving car hit all of them and the six were all rushed to hospital. But at the hospital four died. ”The driver was nearly lynched by angry mob who were angered by his unremorseful attitude, because instead of him to show sympathy for the lives lost, he was busy lamenting the damage inflicted on his car. If not for the intervention of men of Operation Farauta, the driver would have been lynched by the angry mob,” Abubakar said. The Police Public Relations Officer in Adamawa State, DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, said four of the women were conformed dead at the Federal Medical Center (FMC) Yola where the two surviving women are being treated. ”The incident happened at about 9:30pm on 23/6/2021. A vehicle with REG. No. EKY 888 RA was involved,” Nguroje said.
