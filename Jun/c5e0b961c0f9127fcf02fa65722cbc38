Germany defender, Antonio Rudiger, has urged his teammates to play a little dirty football against France forwards when both countries meet on Tuesday night in their Euro 2020 opener at Allianz Arena. France boasts a number of good forwards, including Kylian Mbappe, Karim Benzema, Antoine Greizmann and Olivier Giroud. Didier Deschamps’s side are in a tough group with Germany, Portugal and Hungary. “Of course, they [France] have good forwards [Mbappe, Benzema, Griezmann and Giroud], we have to be ready to win the one-on-one challenges,” Rudiger said at a pre-match press conference ahead of the game. “We have to be a little dirty, not always be nice or try to play nice football. “Against players like them, you have to throw down a marker.” The kick-off time for France vs Germany is 8 pm.
