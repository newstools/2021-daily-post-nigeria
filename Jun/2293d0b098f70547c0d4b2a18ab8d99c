The Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, says it is ready to mint the Gambian Dalasi at the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting PLC (NSPMC) facility when both parties sign the deal. Mr Godwin Emefiele, the CBN Governor accepted the proposal by the Governor of Central Bank of Gambia, Buah Saidy to mint the country’s currency. The CBG Governor made the proposal on Tuesday when he led a top delegation of the Gambian apex bank to Godwin Emefiele in Abuja. According to Buah Saidy, the officials embarked on a two-day visit to Nigeria to learn from the capacity of CBN in a bid to improve on their own structure. “The reason we are here is that when I took over as the Central Bank Governor, I realised that we have certain weaknesses, and to address those weaknesses, there is no better place than the Central Bank of Nigeria, that is why I brought my team to Abuja,” he said. Mr. Emefiele who pledged to grant their demands, said, “we are willing to assist in printing your currency. We can be extremely competitive in terms of cost”.
