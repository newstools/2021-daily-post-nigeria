Popular comedian, Debo Adebayo, more popular as Mr Macaroni, has joined Lagos residents protesting at the Gani Fawehinmi Park in the Ojota area. Police had earlier dispersed the June 12 protesters with tear gas and gunshots. However, they converged again in front of a motor park, approved by the Lagos State Ministry of Transportation, with placards. The crowd chanted “Buhari must go”, demanding good governance and an end to insecurity in the country. Addressing journalists, Mr Macaroni wondered why President Muhammadu Buhari, who contested presidential elections at least four times before he was voted into office, is the same person causing pains to Nigerians. In February 2021, Mr Macaroni was arrested for protesting at the Lekki toll gate, where he demanded that justice be served to the victims of the October 20, 2020 #EndSARS protests at the toll plaza.
