A member of the Academic Staff Union of University, ASUU Benue State chapter, Dr Ogi John has declared support for ranching of cattle in the country. Recall that following the incessant clashes between farmers and herders across the country, many prominent Nigerians called for a ban on open grazing. Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State in May 2017, signed the Open Grazing Prohibition Bill into law as a measure to tackle the farmers and herders crisis in the state.
