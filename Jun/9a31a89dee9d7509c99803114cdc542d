The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo has blamed the administration of late Abiola Ajimobi, a former governor of the state, and the All Progressives Congress (APC) for making hoodlums powerful. The party declared that the violent groups threatening peace and stability in the state gained prominence under the last administration. The PDP Publicity Secretary in the state, Akeem Olatunji, in a statement said the attempt by APC chieftains to celebrate “the legacies” of the late Ajimobi was misplaced and unfounded. “We have it on good authority that the security challenges emanate from activities of rival violence-prone groups which the APC administration of Senator Ajimobi allowed to fester.” He told the APC that residents willl not forget how they allegedly allowed One-million Boys reign supreme in the state capital leaving many residents in perpetual fear. Olatunji called the APC “the architect of present hoodlums-led vandalism in parts of Ibadan in recent times.” “There are many other distasteful experiences to recount but when the PDP, then in the opposition, did everything possible to caution the APC government, it was trivialized.” Olatunji said this was because rival gangs enjoyed maximum patronage and support from the past administration “because they help in shutting the voice of opposition and perceived political enemies”. The spokesman lamented that Governor Seyi Makinde now faces series threats to law and order. The PDP, however, assured the people that the state government will leave no stone unturned to arrest the situation.
