The three lucky survivors of Sunday’s sporadic shooting by a police operative in Enugu have regained consciousness, a medical doctor at the Enugu State University Teaching Hospital, Parklane, has said. DAILY POST had reported that the victims were rushed to the hospital after they suffered gunshot injuries from the attack, which happened around 9.30 a.m. A member of the medical team handling the patients, Dr C.O. Okwor, told NAN on Monday that they had regained consciousness and were stable. Okwor said all the patients are currently doing well and recuperating from the gun-shot injuries as well as the shock from the incident. “They are being given optimal care and as I can see this morning, they are gradually experiencing healing from the wounds and psychological trauma they suffered,’’ he said. He dismissed the reports in some sections of the media that some of them may have their legs amputated. “There is no development to warrant amputation for now,’’ Okwor said. A NAN correspondent, who visited the Emergency Unit of the facility, reports that the patients were seen receiving sympathisers, including family members, friends and well-wishers. The Commissioner of Police, Mr Mohammed Aliyu, confirmed the incident in a statement issued through the command’s Spokesman, ASP Daniel Ndukwe. Aliyu said five persons were shot dead, while four others sustained gunshot injuries during the attack. He, however, did not disclose the identity of the operative.
