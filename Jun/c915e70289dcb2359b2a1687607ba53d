Uzu Okagbue, Chief of Protocol to Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, has pulled out of race for deputy governorship canidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). Okagbue, also Obiano’s Deputy Chief of Staff, cited party unity as the reason for his decision. In a statement on Tuesday, Okagbue declared that he would not vie to run with Professor Charles Soludo. The governor’s aide said he was still preoccupied with helping Obiano finish his tenure successfully. “When, in March 17, 2014 His Excellency appointed me his Chief of Protocol, my singular aim was to help him run a purpose-driven administration that would elevate Ndi Anambra and ease their burdens. “And when, after a resounding second-term victory in 2018, the governor graciously expanded my responsibilities by adding for me even more duties as his Deputy Chief of Staff, that original objective did not change. I reaffirmed it, instead.” Okagbue stressed that Obiano still had nine more months to finish and he would stand by him. “I do not intend to leave him midway. I have no intention of jumping ship. Therefore, assisting the governor to complete what he started remains my preoccupation. “I plead for understanding from everyone who has clamored for my nomination and urge all party leaders, members and supporters to do everything within their powers to ensure we deliver our party in this election”, he noted.
