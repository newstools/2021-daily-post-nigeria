The Enugu State Government has announced the cancellation of Saturday’s sanitation exercise to make it possible for candidates’ access to the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination centers. Recall that the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) on Friday released the results of candidates who sat for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). Dr. Fabian Benjamin, JAMB Head, Media, and Information, who made this known on Friday said that results will be updated for subsequent days and released daily for those yet to see theirs. He further revealed that some results were withheld for investigation, adding that the Board would still review all the CCTV footage and other technical gadgets for detection of possible examination misconducts. Mrs. Amaka Anajemba, Managing Director of Enugu State Government Waste Management Authority, in a statement on Friday said the decision was made in order to make it easier for candidates to check their results. According to her, the state government had to cancel the exercise because all movement, especially vehicles, would be restricted between 6 am and 10 am. She, however, regretted any inconvenience the cancellation would have caused other residents of the state. Hajj cancellation: Ogun returns money to intending pilgrims
