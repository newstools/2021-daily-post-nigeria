Portugal have suffered a major setback ahead of their Euro 2020 opener against Hungary on Tuesday. Portugal defender, Joao Cancelo, pulled out of the team’s squad at the weekend after testing positive for coronavirus [COVID-19]. The Manchester City star is now replaced by Manchester United full-back, Diogo Dalot, who spent the 2020/21 campaign on loan at AC Milan. A statement from the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) read in part: “Under-21 international Diogo Dalot will join the National Team’s delegation in Budapest to prepare for his debut at Euro 2020. “The AC Milan player will replace Joao Cancelo, who tested positive for Covid-19 following a rapid antigen test carried out this Saturday by the FPF Health and Performance Unit. “All players and members of the entourage underwent RT-PCR tests on Saturday. The results, with the exception of Joao Cancelo, were negative.” Portugal is in Group F alongside Hungary, France and Germany.
