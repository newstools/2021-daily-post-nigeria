Carlo Ancelotti has penned an emotional farewell letter to Everton players and fans, after he returned to Real Madrid on Tuesday. The Italian only spent 18 months at Goodison Park, after joining from Napoli. The 61-year-old will now return to the Santiago Bernabeu for a second stint with “the team that was always in my heart”. Ancelotti tweeted from his personal Twitter account: “I would like to thank Everton FC, my players and the supporters for giving me the opportunity to manage this fantastic and historical club. “I decided to leave as I have a new challenge with a team that was always in my heart, Real Madrid. “I leave taking with me all the amazing moments we have experienced together and wish the Club and fans all the best.” Atletico Madrid: Barcelona didn’t value me – Suarez says after winning LaLiga
