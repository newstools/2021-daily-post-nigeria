The Director-General, Zamfara Rural Grazing Agency (RUGA), has said the state government is intensifying efforts to complete the Fulani settlement in three senatorial zones of the state to end banditry. Speaking with DAILY POST in Gusau, the state capital, the Director-General of Rural Grazing Agency (RUGA), Hajiya Amina Ahmad Abubakar said that the peace accord includes building a befitting settlement for the Fulani bandits. “The state Government has been having a series of discussions with the Fulani bandits so as to embrace a peace accord and reconciliation deal,” she said. According to the Director-General, the present administration led by Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle has constructed 210 houses in Dansadau, Zurmi and Maradun towns, bringing the total number of houses to 630 houses in the three towns. Hajiya Abubakar explained that all the facilities that would attract the Fulani herders are there including grazing lands, water for their cattle and every other thing that would make them embrace peace. “We even have police stations there and would ensure that almost all the policemen there would be Fulani people so that there would be relative peace,” she added. The Director-General noted that the RUGA project is now at 82 percent completion, saying that the project would favor both the state government and the Fulani herdsmen.
