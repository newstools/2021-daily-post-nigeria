She enjoined them to uphold the spirit of camaraderie, which is common among the families of security forces that manifests during times of joy and sorrow. The First Lady also called for regular and timely payment of benefits of retired and deceased soldiers so that the affected families get their benefits as at when due and to further serve as motivation for the security forces. She used the opportunity to urge appropriate authorities to conclude the employment of more security officers to address the intractable security problems facing the nation.
