The United Kingdom Government has kicked against the indefinite suspension slammed on Twitter by President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government. The UK government reacted through its High Commissioner in Nigeria, Gill Atkinson on Friday. Atkinson said Nigerians have right to freedom of speech and the government must not suppress it. “All Nigerians have the right to freedom of speech and the responsibility not to misuse that right. “Any action taken by Government must be measured, proportionate and not to suppress basic freedoms.” The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed had explained that Nigerians were using Twitter to perpetuate activities inimical to the corporate existence of Nigeria, hence announcing its suspension.
