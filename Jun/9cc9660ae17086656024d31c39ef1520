Ukraine attacking midfielder, Oleksandr Zinchenko, has named Raheem Sterling as the England player his team needs to “stop” when both countries clash in the Euro 2020 last-8 Saturday in Rome. Ukraine and England booked their place in the Euro 2020 quarter-finals on Tuesday. Andriy Shevchenko’s side defeated Sweden 2-1 after 120 minutes, while the Three Lions won Germany 2-0. “It is really difficult to score against England, they are really well organised,” Zinchenko told reporters at his post-match press conference after Ukraine defeated Sweden. “They have a really good set of footballers and the substitute bench probably costs [the same] as three Ukrainian teams. “This should not be really scary for us, this should motivate us. We need to give ourselves the highest aims, the highest goals, and I am sure that the coaching team will get the strategy for us. “I sense myself that everything is possible in this life and we will do everything we can for it. “I have watched pretty much all the games that England have played, except today because we were getting ready for our game. “The first thing that I noticed is I know quite a lot of those players personally because I see them in the Premier League. “Raheem Sterling is one of the best wingers in the world. Right now, he is in amazing form. “He is great, he makes the difference. We obviously need to pay attention to him and we will need to try to somehow stop him because he is on a roll now. “Who is the strongest opponent that I have ever played? I have said several times that it is the footballers from Manchester City, those that I see every day at training.”
