Returning Juventus manager, Max Allegri, does not want Cristiano Ronaldo to be part of his 2021/2022 squad, according to Corriere della Sera. Instead, the Italian tactician has identified two players who can replace him. One of these is Dusan Vlahovic. The Fiorentina player emerged as one of the surprise packages of the Serie A last campaign. Allegriâ€™s other target is reportedly Mauro Icardi, who currently plays at Paris Saint-Germain. Icardi could come back to the Italian topflight, where he enjoyed the most success. Ronaldo is still contracted to Juventus until 2022, but is being linked with Manchester United, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. Allegri tells Juventus chief, Agnelli to sell Cristiano Ronaldo
