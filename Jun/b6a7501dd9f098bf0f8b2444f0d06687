Confusions broke out today at the inauguration of 18 new Justices for the Court of Appeal who were elevated from various High Courts. The confusion which centred on seniority of the judges in the call for inauguration by the Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Honourable Justice Ibrahim Muhammad almost marred the occasion. The Chief Registrar of the Court kick-started the controversies when she addressed Mohammed Danjuma as Grand Khadi in place of Honourable Justice Mohammed Danjuma. It took the intervention of the CJN before the appropriate designation could be applied. The situation became worse during the proper call for inauguration when the Chief Registrar called junior ones three times before the senior ones against the laid down tradition of seniority. A junior Judge, Bola Samuel Ademola who was called thrice for inauguration declined and insisted that the well known tradition of seniority must be adhered to. Also, the sitting arrangement of the 18 new Appellate Court Justices witnessed a mild drama as junior ones were made to sit on the seat earmarked for the senior ones. It took the intervention of some staff of the apex court before the ugly situation could be brought to order. Details laterâ€¦
