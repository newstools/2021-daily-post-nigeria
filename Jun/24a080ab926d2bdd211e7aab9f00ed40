A leading Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, has said the Federal Government’s move to reopen the grazing routes is unacceptable. The South West group said the decision shows dishonesty and the draconian tendencies of the government. Afenifere’s National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, in a statement on Sunday, said the Federal Government’s insistence shows disdain and contempt that it has for the people. “The insistence of the present administration on re-opening the so-called grazing routes shows the duplicity, dishonesty and the draconian tendencies of the government,” Afenifere said. “The insistence also further underscores the extent of the disdain and contempt that this administration has for the people. “We say this because government policies are supposed to be for the people. The majority of the people across the country have embraced ranching.” “Even the Minister of Agriculture Nanono disclosed that 22 states plus the Federal Capital Territory have agreed to provide land for grazing. “He went further to give names of the states including the 400,000 hectares of land already said to have been provided by various states. “What is more, it has been established that the so-called grazing routes did not exist in all the states in the country. “They would want to go the whole hog. Reopening the grazing routes is unacceptable on any grounds.” Gov Akeredolu kicks against Buhari’s move for open grazing
