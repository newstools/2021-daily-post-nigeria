AS Roma manager, Jose Mourinho has singled out Chelsea’s Reece James and Manchester United’s Luke Shaw for criticism ahead of England’s final Group D tie against the Czech Republic on Tuesday evening. Mourinho said both James and Shaw have been ‘poor’ offensively for England at the Euro 2020. “The most important thing is the confidence of players,” Mourinho told talkSPORT. “I don’t believe at all that for example, when Gareth [Southgate] decided to play the last game with James and Shaw; I don’t believe he told them don’t attack, stay on the line of the four, be cautious. England squad: I regret not taking my chances – Man Utd star, Luke Shaw” I don’t believe that. To do that, you do that with other players. To do that, then you play Ben White in defence alongside the Mings and Stones as well. “I think the confidence of the players (is important). James and Shaw are attacking and fast players. “Normally, they go forward and create. They arrive in the box and create. They didn’t against Scotland. They stayed very, very quiet. They didn’t make mistakes. But offensively, they were poor.” Luke Shaw vs Ben Chilwell, Saka: Ashley Cole, Roy Keane name better left-back for England
