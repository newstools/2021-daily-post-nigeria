Senator Yahaya Abdullahi has blamed poor security architecture in the country for the Kebbi State school abduction. The lawmaker spoke on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics. Abdullahi, who represents Kebbi North, said the number of security personnel, specifically policemen across Nigeria, was grossly insufficient to fight the level of insecurity the country was grappling with. He said, “What we are saying is that the troops on the ground in the security architecture of this country are terribly inadequate, so we have to sit down and rebuild the security architecture in such a way that we allow local communities to do community policing so that we can have enough men on the ground for any mass attack. “If there were enough men on the ground like about 100 well-armed policemen, this kind of thing would not be happening.” He added, “These things have their roots in the very serious security architecture that we inherited over a long period of time. We have to look at these issues from a historical perspective. “Banditry in the country has become a recurring decimal and we should not look at it as something that is just happening today.” DAILY POST recalls that armed men suspected to be bandits had abducted the students and teachers of the Federal Government College Birnin Yawuri in Kebbi on Thursday. The bandits were said to have killed a police officer before whisking the four staff and an unspecified number of students to an unknown location. One of the students abducted from the school was shot dead during a gun duel between soldiers and the abductors.  Meanwhile, five of the abducted students and two teachers of the Federal Government College in Birnin-Yauri, Kebbi State, have been rescued. Their rescue was disclosed by the Nigerian Army on Friday. The army also confirmed that during a gun duel that ensued, an exhausted student gave up the ghost.
