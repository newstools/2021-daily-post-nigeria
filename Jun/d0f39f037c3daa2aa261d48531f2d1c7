Davido’s world has again been shattered by the death of Habeeb Uthman, popularly known as Obama DMW, the singer’s personal aide. Obama DMW died on Tuesday after a reported heart failure. Obama’s death threw the entire members of Davido Music World (DMW), into mourning and opened old wounds of losses in recent years. However, DAILY POST observed that Obama is the fourth known member of the DMW crew to have died in the last four years. Before Obama’s death, Davido had lost some of his close ‘pals’ such as his personal bodyguard Tijani aka Tj, Tagbo; Dj Olu and Ahmed (King Jhaffi. Recall that Olugbenga Abiodun popularly known as DJ Olu was found dead in a BMW car parked at a garage on Banana Island, Lagos while Tagbo Umeike died from Asynxeria, police confirmed. The deaths of Tagbo and Dj Olu caused Davido a lot of emotional issues and a whole lot of controversies and drama. Davido was accused of having a hand in Tagbo’s death with the public raising eyebrows as he was present when his friend died. But the ‘OBO’ crooner cleared himself of any complicity in the death of late Tagbo Umeike as he was questioned by the police at the time by releasing the Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage. The reports of the death of his crew members hit Davido the hardest as he revealed that he is tired of being strong while mourning his personal bodyguard of 11 years who died in December, 2020. Davido expressing sadness over the death on Twitter wrote, “I am tired of being strong.” The last one which seems to have broken the singer down is the death of Obama DMW. Obama DMW while alive was always seen with the singer in his private jet trips, shows and parties.
A few days before his death, he was in the studio with Davido. Rarely will you see Davido in public spaces without the likes of Obama DMW by his side. It is not certain how the singer feels about life at the moment.
