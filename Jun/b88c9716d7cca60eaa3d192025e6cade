Arsenal has agreed to a deal with Benfica for Nuno Tavares, with the player set to undergo a medical ahead of a £7 million transfer. The two clubs have been in negotiations for days over the left-back, with Gunners boss Mikel Arteta keen to bring in Tavares as cover for Kieran Tierney. After a slight hitch in negotiations yesterday, a deal for the 21-year-old has now been reached. Arsenal has agreed to pay an initial fee of around £7m for Tavares. That fee could rise, however, by a further £1.5m should certain clauses be met during his time at the Emirates. The Benfica youngster will now undergo a medical before finalising his switch.
