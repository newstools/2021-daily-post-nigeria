A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), in Lagos State, Ambassador Abayomi Nurain Mumuni has advised candidates seeking to contest the National Chairmanship of the party to surrender themselves to anti-graft agencies for scrutiny. Mumini, who is a close associate of President Muhamadu Buhari, urged candidates willing to be National Chairman of the party to surrender themselves to the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for profiling. He said that this was necessary in order for Nigerians and the party members to know their worth. Our correspondent gathered that no fewer than eight (8) candidates have indicated interest to be the National Chairman of the party at the convention of the party slated to take place in October this year. But, Mumini in a statement issued by his Media Aide, Rasheed Abubakar, a copy of which was made available to DAILY POST on Tuesday in Ibadan, said that without any sentiments, any of those aspirants should surrender themselves to ICPC or EFCC for profiling for Nigerians and the party to know their substance. Mumini, who contested gubernatorial election on the platform of the defunct Congress for Progressives Change (CPC) in 2011 in Lagos State, insisted that APC does not need a Chairman of zero substance this time around or an imposed chairman under some ancient godfather as it was done in the past. He said “Without any sentiments, any of those aspirants should surrender themselves to the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) or the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for profiling for Nigerians or our dear party, APC to know their substance. “Our great party, the APC does not need a Chairman of zero substance this time around or an imposed chairman under some ancient godfather as we did experience in the previous epochs.”
