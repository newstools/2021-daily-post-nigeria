Femi Olusegun, an educationist, has appealed to employers to give Nigerian graduates the needed opportunities to perform and progress in their career. Olusegun, the Proprietor of Rising Stars Nursery and Primary School, Ilorin, condemned how expatriates are brought in for jobs citizens can do better. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that most organisations doubt graduates from Nigeria. “We have the best brains, we have capable graduates that can perform better than the so called foreign experts.” Olusegun said it is waste of money to hire foreigners to work in sectors that can be managed by young, energetic Nigerians. He called the situation “discriminatory,” noting that the practice is common in engineering firms and the likes. “Nigerian graduates are not inferior, they are far better than the hyped foreign experts.” The proprietor advised the youths to be hard-working and avoid acts capable of destroying their future.
