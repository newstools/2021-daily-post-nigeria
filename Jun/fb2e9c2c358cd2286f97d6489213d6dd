AS Roma manager, Jose Mourinho, has named his England best XI ahead of the Three Lions’ Euro 2020 opener against Croatia on Sunday. Mourinho did not pick Manchester United stars, Marcus Rashford and Luke Shaw in his starting XI. The Portuguese said that both Harry Kane and Jack Grealish would be “untouchables” in his starting eleven. He went with an attacking trio of Grealish, Phil Foden and Mason Mount behind Kane, with Kalvin Phillips and Declan Rice behind them.

When he plays on the right he completely loses his dynamic, it’s totally broken. He’s very good on the left, attacking space. “I would say Grealish on the left, Mount as the number 10 and it is something I like a lot, inverted wingers, so I would play Foden on the right.” “At left-back, I would go with Chilwell,” Mourinho added. “I wouldn’t think twice. He is intelligent. “(Luke Shaw) I think has had a good season, clearly an evolution in terms of emotionally and professionally, but I think Chilwell has something more, especially with the ball, the way he thinks. He is very calm under pressure. I like Chilwell a lot.” “I am a Henderson fan. He has this arrogance in him, this trust and belief which I think an England goalkeeper needs.” Below is Mourinho’s England starting XI; Henderson, Stones, Mings, Walker, Chilwell, Philips, Rice, Mount, Foden, Grealish and Kane.
