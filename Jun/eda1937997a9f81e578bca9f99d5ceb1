The Ikeja branch of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has said that the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) called off its strike too early without achieving its aim of financial autonomy. Mr Bartholomew Aguegbodo, the Chairman of the Ikeja branch of the NBA, also described the suspension of the industrial action by JUSUN as “not worth it”. “Having sustained the strike for over two-months, the question JUSUN should have asked when considering calling off the strike is what have we achieved?

If you’re fighting a noble cause and you cannot sustain it, it is not worth commencing it. “The period the strike was on was fruitless. JUSUN says it is suspending the strike and is giving the government three-months to implement terms, we know after three months we won’t be able to call up another action. “The calling off of the strike is quite unfortunate, nothing has been achieved so far and it is going to remain business as usual,” Aguegbodo told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday.
