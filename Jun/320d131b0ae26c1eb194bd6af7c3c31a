The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo State, has again, come out with heavy criticism against the government of Senator Hope Uzodinma in the state. The opposition party in the state said the governor is misleading the people because he doesn’t have their mandate. Collins Opuruzor, the state PDP Director General of New Media, stated this after a phone-in program of the governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, on Imo Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) on Saturday. He said the reason the governor can dish out lies at his disposal was because Imo people did not vote for him in the last governorship election. According to him, “Imo people will never forget in a hurry the powerful magic that turned a fourth person to be the first. “At this critical time when the governor should come out open to tell the people the truth, he is still running to the radio to dish out lies to good people of Imo state. This is rather unfortunate. “I urge the governor to go to a private-owned radio station and engage the people of Imo state. We all know that IBC belongs to the state and all the staff including the presenter, Joyce Unegbu, are payable to his government. “The governor is only adding salt to injury by coming on air to continue telling Imo people lies. “Imo is currently bleeding and a governor is on air telling the whole world that all is well. This is an irony!” The governor, in the said radio outing, claimed that no Imo worker and pensioner was being owed a dime. Uzodinma reacts to killing of five gunmen by Police in Imo
