The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that President Muhammadu Buhari will be judged for the achievements of his administration. The party said it was wrong to judge the President by propaganda, vowing to bring those trying to bring the government down to book. Speaking at the party’s National Secretariat on Thursday in Abuja, Secretary of the APC caretaker/extraordinary convention planning committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe said plans to destroy the current administration would fail. APC can win Anambra by showing Buhari’s achievements – Party Chieftain Some disgruntled elements in the country, according to the party chieftain, were blackmailing and discrediting the government. “President Muhammadu Buhari will be judged by security and other achievements. We should not analyse the achievements of this government based on blackmail,” he said. “Those who are trying to take down President Muhammadu Buhari’s government through the backdoor, will not succeed. “They are hyping up so that people will believe there is insecurity. They are organised to bring down the government of the APC. We will bring them to book, Insha Allah,” he said. A few days ago, President Muhammadu Buhari had threatened to come down heavily on those who are trying to destroy his government. The President pointed accusing fingers at secessionist groups in the South East, wondering what could be their reasons for destroying government facilities even when, according to him, his administration was working in accordance with the constitution.
