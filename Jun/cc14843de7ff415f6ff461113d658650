Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has offered up to seven of his players to Barcelona, according to AS. Guardiola wants to raid his former club for defender Sergi Roberto and winger Ousmane Dembele. It was part of his conversations with Barca president, Joan Laporta, when they met at a golf legends event in Mallorca this week. Guardiola is willing to allow Aymeric Laporte leave, after his ouster from City’s starting XI by Ruben Dias. Laporte has just won his first cap for Spain ahead of Monday’s Euros clash with Sweden and Barcelona see him as the ideal signing should Clement Lenglet or Samuel Umtiti leave. Raheem Sterling was the second player offered to the Spanish giants after struggling for minutes. He has apparently long been open to joining either Barcelona or Real Madrid.
