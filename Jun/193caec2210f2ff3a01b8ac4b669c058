Stop this scam, extortion – Tuface calls out NCDC for frustrating travelers “You see, Annie is from an average background like myself and we both started from nothing. “She stuck by me through it all. When there was no car she hopped on bikes, took the bus, and even trekked with me. “When there was no money or house or hit song or millions of albums sold or big awards and accolades. “She would always hold my head, look me in the eyes and tell me things will be fine one day.
