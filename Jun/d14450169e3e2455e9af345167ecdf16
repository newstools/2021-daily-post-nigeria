Two days after four Chinese expatriates were abducted at the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge project site, they have not been rescued, DAILY POST reports. This is as the Ogun State Police Command said it is yet to locate the abductors of the four Chinese nationals. DAILY POST reported that a police escort was killed by about eight gunmen, who invaded the site of the project at Adeaga/Alaagba village, Odeda Local Government Area of the state on Wednesday evening to take away the foreign workers. In an interview with DAILY POST, the Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the Chinese expatriates are yet to be rescued. According to Oyeyemi, the police has collaborated with other security agencies to ensure the abductees were rescued unhurt. He revealed that all the command’s tactical teams had been deployed to the area as security agents comb the forest to search for the unknown gunmen.

They are working with other security agencies to ensure the safe release of those people. As soon as we have a breakthrough, I will let you know,” Oyeyemi told DAILY POST. The police spokesperson said he could not confirm the name of the slain policeman at the moment, adding, however, that he was an Inspector. DAILY POST reports that millions of Naira have been paid in ransom to kidnappers across Ogun State in the past three months. Our correspondent gathered that kidnapping has now turned into a lucrative business in Ogun, with many unreported cases in different locations. So far, two policemen have been killed by kidnappers within the period under review. But, Governor Dapo Abiodun has repeatedly read the riot act to criminals in the state, saying they would be smoked out from their hideouts.
