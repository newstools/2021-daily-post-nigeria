The incident which happened about 2pm attracted irate youths, who burnt down the truck and the cattle, resisting attempts to free the cattle before setting ablaze the truck. Our source was, however, unable to say if the driver of the truck and the truck attendant were spared.  As of the time of filing this report, irate youths have defied attempt by the Anambra State Fire Service to put off the fire on the truck. The multiple accident has also caused traffic gridlock in many areas in Awka. Meanwhile, there was massive shooting in the area by military personnel to disperse irate youths who stopped attempts to tow the truck off the road to make way for free flow of traffic. The shooting in the area caused residents and even motorists to abandon their vehicles and flee for their lives.
