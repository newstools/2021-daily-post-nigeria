Hamza Al-Mustapha, Chief Security Officer to late Nigerian military ruler, Sani Abacha, says the elites in Nigeria are killing the country. Al-Mustapha also declared that the ongoing amendment of the 1999 constitution will not work. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the citizens are not being carried along in the process. “Constitutional amendments should be given time and should not be seen carrying the opinions of a few elites abandoning the majority”, he said. Lawan mentions those behind Nigeria’s breakup plot Al-Mustapha regretted that most Nigerians in rural communities are not aware of what is going on. “The elites are the problem of Nigeria. Institutions are killed by the elites, they determine government direction, they are government contractors. Top civil servants are part of the elites,” he lamented. Al-Mustapha insisted that the problem of Nigeria revolves around the elites, not the masses. “You say that the 1999 constitution was rejected because it was done in a rush and here you are doing amendment haphazardly. “If you want to have an acceptable constitution for everybody in the country, then you require a detailed plan of action that will carry everybody along”, added.
