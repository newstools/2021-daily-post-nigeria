Seun Kuti, son of Afrobeat legend, Fela Kuti, has told Grammy award-winning singer, Wizkid to stop parading himself as a Grammy nominee, Kuti claimed Wizkid does not deserve to be called a Grammy nominee. In an Instagram video posted on Tuesday, Kuti indirectly asked Wizkid to stop desist from claiming to be a Grammy nominee. He explained that he, Femi Kuti, King Sunny Ade and Burna Boy, were the only Nigerian musicians to be nominated by the Grammy. Femi Kuti reacts as Fela loses 2021 Rock n Roll Hall of Fame induction
He also insisted that since Wizkid was featured in a song that won a Grammy award, he had no right to say he had won a Grammy for Nigeria, as the song belonged to American singer, Beyonce. “There are only four artists in Nigeria (to have ever been) nominated for the Grammy, and I am one of them,” Kuti added, directly under the video post. Recall that a song Wizkid featured in won a Grammy Award in March this year. The 30-year-old won the Best music video for ‘Brown Skin Girl’ with Beyoncé, while Burner Boy won the award for the Best Global Music Album, ‘Twice as Tall’.
