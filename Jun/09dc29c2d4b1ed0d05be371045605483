The Personal Assistant to President, Muhammadu Buhari on Digital and New Media, Bashir Ahmad, has reacted to the arrest of self-acclaimed Biafran leader, Nnamdi Kanu. DAILY POST had reported that Kanu was arrested by a combined team of Nigerian and foreign security agents in a coordinated interception. The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, on Tuesday, at an emergency media briefing in his office confirmed the arrest of Kanu. Reacting, Bashir took to his Facebook account to state that President Buhari’s language is now clear for everyone to understand. “The language is now so clear for everyone to understand,” he wrote. Recall that Buhari had on Tuesday after a security briefing about the attacks on facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in the South East, categorically threatened to deal with those who, according to him, want to destroy his government. He had said such individuals or groups will receive the shock of their lives as they will be treated in a language they will understand.
