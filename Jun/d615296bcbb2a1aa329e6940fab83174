Actor Yomi Fabiyi has sued for peace with his colleague, Iyabo Ojo. Recall that Fabiyi and Iyabo Ojo’s relationship became sour following Baba Ijesha rape saga. While the likes of Iyabo Ojo and other celebrities demanded justice and condemned the act, Fabiyi called for patience, warning actors to stop passing judgement on the accused until he is proven guilty in court. This caused a rift between actors who took to Instagram threatening and insulting each other. However, Fabiyi on Saturday took to his Instagram, saying he doesn’t wish to quarrel with Iyabo Ojo. He noted that he is still in shock on how the face-off turned out, urging Iyabo Ojo to find peace with others as he has ‘forgiven’ her of every hurt done to him. His post read: “Iyabo deep inside my heart I still do not wish to get angry or quarrel with you. I’m still shocked how this turned out. “Dear find peace, find peace with others and yourself. I wouldn’t say because of this issue I’ll deny who you were. You used to be a nice person. Iyabo Ojo makes vows as Police grants Baba Ijesha bail
“I forgive all hurt done to me. Be good, hopefully this meets you well.” Meanwhile, Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of the Ikeja Special Offences Court on Thursday granted Baba Ijesha bail in the sum of two million naira and two sureties. Baba Ijesha, who has been in custody since his arrest on April 22, was arraigned at a Yaba Magistrates’ Court on charges of indecent treatment of a child, defilement of a child, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault.
