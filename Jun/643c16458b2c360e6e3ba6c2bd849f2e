The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) is panicky because the ruling platform now has “over 40 million members.” In a statement, John Akpan Udoedehe, Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee said the PDP was clutching on straws. The APC said it is providing critical infrastructure, access to education, health facilities and empowering citizens. The scribe accused PDP governors of wasting resources on meetings while owing workers and pensioners. The opposition had in a communique queried loans procured by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. APC members are ‘cultists’ – PDP The PDP further alleged that the current leadership is claiming projects executed by past governments. “Perhaps, the PDP is referring to the litany of abandoned projects it left all over the country despite 16 years in power and receiving unprecedented earnings when crude oil sold for $150 per barrel.” The APC said it is executing the Second Niger Bridge, the Lagos-Ibadan dual carriageway, the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano road, the Abuja-Akwanga-Lafia-Makurdi highway, among others. Udoedehe also mentioned completion and commissioning of the Lagos-Ibadan twin track railway, and mocked the PDP for failing to complete the Abuja-Kaduna rail line concluded by the Buhari administration. “PDP needs to be reminded that It was because of its failures that Nigerians rejected it twice in 2015 and 2019. This loss is obviously still haunting the PDP and has caused disarray within its ranks and created irreconcilable divisions. “For a party that failed in its 16-year governance and as an opposition party, if the PDP believes that Nigerians are ready to place the administration of the country in its hand, then the PDP is a victim of its folly”, the statement added.
