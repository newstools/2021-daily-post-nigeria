Hungary coach Marco Rossi has branded Portugal captain, Cristiano Ronaldo “annoying” after his side were eliminated from Euro 2020 on Wednesday. Portugal was the only team to defeat Hungary in the Group F as Rossi’s charges put up a valiant performance that saw them hold France and Germany to 1-1 and 2-2 draws respectively. Their 3-0 defeat to Portugal in the opening-game left them facing an uphill battle to reach the knockout stage. Hungary kept Portugal for well over 80 minutes only for Raphael Guerreiro to break the deadlock with a deflected strike.

After scoring from the spot against Hungary, the 36-year-old marked the goal in trademark fashion by performing a 180-degree spin in mid air and shouting “siu!” as he landed with both arms outstretched. Ronaldo’s celebration is arguably the most iconic in football, however, the celebration angered Rossi, who warned the Juventus superstar that he is rubbing people up the wrong way. “Ronaldo is a great champion but at times he can be annoying. After the penalty with us he celebrated as if he had scored in the final. People notice these things,” Rossi told La Gazzetta dello Sport.Hungary Euro 2020: Germany beat Portugal as France fail to defeat Hungary
