Member, Lagos State House of Assembly, representing Surulere Constituency, Desmond Elliot, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to reconsider his ban on Twitter operations in the country. Elliot, ironically, took to his Twitter page to state this. According to the Nollywood actor and director, Nigerians have the freedom to express themselves and the ban tramples on their rights.
