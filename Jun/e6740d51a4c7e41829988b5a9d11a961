President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with the family and members of The Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN) on the death of their father and founder, Pastor Temitope Balogun, who is more popular as TB Joshua. The condolence message was signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, on Sunday. Buhari noted that Joshua will be missed “not only for his spiritual contributions but for touching many lives through philanthropic gestures.” He also urged the cleric’s followers “to take solace in the knowledge that life is not measured and defined by chronological longevity but by enduring legacies and lives touched positively.” The president also condoled with the government and people of Ondo State. Joshua died on Saturday night at 57 on his way to the hospital after an event at SCOAN.
