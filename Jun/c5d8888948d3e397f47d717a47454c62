Some dare devil armed robbers on Monday robbed staff of the Kwara State House of Assembly at the popular Circular Hotels on New Yidi road in Ilorin, the state capital. DAILY POST reports that the robbery incident occurred at about 12.50 pm after three Accounts Department staff of the House of Assembly withdrew N10m from the Access bank along Wahab Folawiyo road in Ilorin. The victims said that the money was withdrawn from the bank and kept inside the car boot. They drove out of the bank premises and moved towards Unity road junction and the new Yidi road only to be blocked by four masked armed robbers in front of the Circular Hotels, in a tinted ash coloured Toyota Camry car. The four armed men with AK-47 rifles, reportedly collected the car from the driver, opened the car boot in a movie-like operation and carted away the money with the car key. DAILY POST gathered that the armed robbers, aged between 20 and 25 years, zoomed off towards Kamwire junction via Yidi road, Ilorin after the robbery operation. An Assembly official who requested anonymity confirmed the development to our correspondent. When contacted to confirm the development, the spokesman of the state police command, Mr Okasanmi Ajayi, said in a text message that the command was yet to receive an official report of the incident. He, however, said that the State Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Lawal Bagega, has directed immediate pursuit of the criminals despite the non-official report of the incident. “The CP has also ordered an immediate investigation into the case”, the spokesman added.
