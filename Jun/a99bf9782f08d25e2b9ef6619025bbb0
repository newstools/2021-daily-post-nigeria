Actress Iyabo Ojo has responded to her colleague, Yomi Fabiyi’s plea for peace between them. DAILY POST earlier reported that Fabiyi, in a recent post, asked Iyabo Ojo to embrace peace and move on from any hate instigated by the Baba Ijesha rape saga. However, Iyabo Ojo in a video on her instagram page laughed at his post, describing it as clout chasing just to gain more followers. The mother of two said, “Yomi I saw your write up and I really laughed because I don’t understand it. So I used to be nice but just because I chose to stand for justice with Princess and that young girl you said i’m no longer nice. “But you put my name on a placard and said I’ll kill Baba Ijesha if he comes out and you claim to be nice. I still need you to come out with video of where I said that . Baba Ijesha disgraced Yoruba movie industry – Iyabo Ojo slams Yomi Fabiyi
“I have so much peace that you may not understand. I don’t know what you want with that write up maybe you want more followers. “You’re still basking and enjoying the clouting chasing on social media.”
