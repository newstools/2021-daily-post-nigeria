Paris Saint-Germain is working on bringing Zinedine Zidane to the club, according to Le 10 Sport. Zidane walked out on Real Madrid for the second time after the 2020/2021 season, where Los Blancos finished trophyless. His availability has now alerted the decision-makers at PSG. The Ligue 1 giants have been trying to hold on to Mauricio Pochettino, who is keen to return to Tottenham Hotspur. While not ushering the Argentine out the exit door, Pochettino won’t find as much protest now should Spurs firm up plans to take him back to London.
