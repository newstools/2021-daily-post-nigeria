The arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, will mark the end of the group. Some Nigerians made the assertion while claiming that Kanu’s rearrest was an indication that President Muhammadu Buhari was in charge of the country’s security. Kanu’s rearrest by the Nigerian government is said to be a signal to Yoruba freedom fighter, Sunday Adeyemo popularly called Igboho that agitators are not above the law. A combined team of Nigerian and foreign agents had rearrested Kanu in a coordinated operation. Kanu’s rearrest was confirmed by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, on Tuesday. Kanu who was put on trial on charges bothering on terrorism, treasonable felony and sponsoring unlawful organization had escaped from Nigeria shortly after his arraignment before the Federal High Court in Abuja and admission on bail. Justice Binta Nyako who granted him bail on the ground of his Ill health, had revoked the bail on March 28, 2019 and issued a bench warrant for his arrest in any part of Nigeria. The rearrested IPOB leader is appearing before the Federal High Court today, for the continuation of his trial. However, some Nigerians said the action of the government was applaudable. Taking to their Twitter handle, they urged the government to ensure that the IPOB leader does not escape again. Tweets gathered by DAILY POST reads @sunnyman: “This is a welcomed development, I commend the government for arresting Kanu. His arrest shows Buhari is in charge.” @CNB atinsola: “Nnamdi Kanu’s rearrest will mark the end IPOB and all these rubbish agitations. He is not above the law, should be dealt with.” @omukoko: “Kanu’s arrest would send a message to agitators like Sunday Igboho and co that Nigeria is not a Banana Republic where they can just stand up and start causing trouble.”
