Recall that Ka3na and Lilo were the first housemates to be evicted from the lockdown edition. Ka3na said: “I didn’t have enough time to bond with the housemates before I was evicted and the comments I heard when I was out of the house from the housemates was the reason I unfollowed almost everyone. “Also, I unfollowed most of the housemates because of what they thought about me.” However, Tolanibaj opposed her reason, insinuating that Ka3na unfollowed most of them because they attended Nengi’s birthday party.
