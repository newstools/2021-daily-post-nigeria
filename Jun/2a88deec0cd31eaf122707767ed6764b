Primate Elijah Ayodele, Leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, on Wednesday, said Christians are the major problem of the country. The cleric also said that leadership of religious associations such as the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) are working for the government and for their own personal gains. “Christians are the problems of Nigeria, they don’t have love, they have different doctrines, and some preaching are not even biblical,” the cleric said in a statement to DAILY POST on Wednesday. The prophet was angered by lack of support from topshot pastors in the country to the family of T.B Joshua, the Senior Prophet of the Synagogue Church Of All Nations (SCOAN), who died earlier in the month. “There is so much hatred in Christianity and that is why I will never join CAN, PFN or any Christian association, they are associations of envy and hatred,” he added. “CAN, PFN are just associations for the government and for personal gains. These associations are not biblical. “I have no apology, I don’t want anyone to like me, I am saying this the way I feel, this is a time when we need love and unity in Christianity but those that are the supposed leaders have killed the spirit of love in Christianity. The administrators of this association are selfish, greedy and totally self-centered.” MURIC backs Sharia in South-West, tells Christians to ‘mind their business’
