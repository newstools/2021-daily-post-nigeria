It appears the efforts of the Bukola Saraki-led reconciliation committee to unite the Ladi Adebutu and Buruji Kashamu factions of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State has not yielded the desired result as the two groups renewed their rivalry over the forthcoming local government elections in the state. DAILY POST reports that the July 24 local government election in the state has once again triggered another infighting, with the two factions battling for recognition before the Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission (OGSIEC). The Spokesman of the PDP in Ogun State, Akinloye Bankole, had earlier raised the alarm that the OGSIEC had given forms to one Leke Shittu, a loyalist of the Late Senator Buruji Kashamu. But, the Chairman of the Commission, Babatunde Osibodu, said he does not recognise anybody other than officials of the political parties. Osibodu said he had met and discussed with the various factions of the party. He said the commission has been able to identify the authentic faction based on the documents provided. Reacting to a question on a live radio programme monitored by DAILY POST on Sunday, Osibodu said: “I do not recognise anyone called Buruji Kashamu or any other name of any other person, other than the officials of political parties. Factions have come, they have given us their documents, we have discussed with them and we have taken a decision that this is the one that is the authentic faction and we have indeed given them the…, we have accorded them recognition accordingly. Other than that, I really can’t say anything,” Osibodu stated. However, Osibodu did not reveal which of the factions he had accorded recognition as the authentic one.
