Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment, has disclosed how he lured people of Anambra State to join the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ngige disclosed that he lured people of the state using all Federal Government alleviation programmes executed in the state. He spoke on Channels Television while lamenting over the APC primaries held in the state. Ngige also faulted the election that produced Senator Andy Uba as the APC candidate in the Anambra gubernatorial poll. “It’s not a case of you didn’t mobilise. All the aspirants contributed money when we were doing the registration. “All the aspirants were interested in going to the wards and getting people out. “I, as a minister, I brought some of the poverty alleviation programmes to many of the communities to get people (you know, to ginger them) to join my party,” he said.
