England manager, Gareth Southgate, has admitted that it will be “very complicated” for Mason Mount and Ben Chilwell to start their last-16 match. The Chelsea duo were forced into quarantine, after coming into close contact with Scotland’s midfielder, Billy Gilmour, who tested positive for COVID-19. Mount and Chilwell both missed the 1-0 win over the Czech Republic on Tuesday. “We think the quarantine ends at midnight of match day. “What we don’t know is how much training they can do and what might be possible. They can obviously train individually and we think there might be a period where they can train in groups distanced, but I’m not sure they can join in the whole group. “So the reality is it’s really complicated for them to start in the game next week,” England manager Southgate said on BBC Radio 5 Live after England’s win over the Czechs.
