The attacks surged since 2020, with news of the audacious invasion of schools and communities making headlines every week. Buhari orders Army, Police to treat bandits in language they understand
Security agencies say they are on their trail but most of the assailants are on the loose, continuing their atrocities. Lately, some former military personnel has been providing information on bandits to law enforcement arms. The retired officers give information about the activities, hideouts and movements of the criminals in Kebbi, Niger and others. “This has fostered inter-agency cooperation and aided the planning of operations against bandits as most of ‘Yan Sakai’ volunteers are retired soldiers and security personnel. “The generals’ efforts have disorganized the bandits and their evil missions. They may now find it difficult to be moving in a battalion to attack communities”, an operative told PRNigeria. On Friday, the Police in Kebbi said they are yet to know the actual number of students kidnapped from the Federal Government College (FGC), Birnin Yauri. The school, located in Ngaski Local Government Area, was hit on Thursday. Police spokesman, Nafi’u Abubakar refuted reports that bandits took more than 50 students. “The command wishes to make it clear that a yet-to-be ascertained the number of students are still missing as rescue operation is still ongoing.” Abubakar stressed that the claims that a police vehicle was driven by the assailants was false. He said a white Hilux with registration no. KBSJ 29 belonging to a High Court judge, earlier hijacked, was used for the attack. A joint operation by the Army, Police and ‘Yan Sakai’ vigilantes in villages around the school eliminated scores of bandits Thursday night.
