President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday in Abuja commenced the process to reduce poverty in Nigeria. Buhari inaugurated the National Steering Committee (NSC) of the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. The Nigerian leader reiterated his commitment to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in ten years. In attendance were Osinbajo, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, some governors and top government officials. Buhari noted that the NPRGS already proposed the establishment of a private equity fund, the Nigeria Investment and Growth Fund (NIG-Fund). The fund will lead resource mobilization drive and also manage the resources in a sustainable manner. “I am happy to note that the process of designing this inclusive poverty reduction strategy recognized and addressed past mistakes as well as laying the foundation for a sustainable poverty reduction through the wide range consultations held at all levels of government, development partners, the private sector as well as the civil society,’’ he said. The President added that the NPRGS would address the underlying causes of poverty. The major challenge, according him, is to translate his government’s good intention into positive impact of the average Nigerian. Buhari said if India can lift 271million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016, Nigeria can lift 100million out of poverty in 10 years. Members of the committee are Mustapha, Chief of Staff to the President, Ibrahim Gambari; Kayode Fayemi, Governor of Ekiti (South West); Ifeanyi Okowa, Governor of Delta (South South); Aminu Tambuwal, Governor of Sokoto (North West). Others are Babagana Zulum, Governor of Borno (North East); Abdullahi Sule, Governor of Nasarawa (North Central), and Dave Umahi, Governor of Ebonyi (South East) and Ministers.
