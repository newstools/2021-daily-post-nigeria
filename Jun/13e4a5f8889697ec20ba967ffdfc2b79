A 25-year-old farmer, Mohammad Mohammad in Kasesa village near Damaturu in Yobe State has been arrested for allegedly poisoning nine wells in the community. The state police command, through its spokesman, ASP Dungus Abdulkarim confirmed the arrest on Thursday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). The PPRO said the suspect confessed to the crime but said he intended to deter herders from invading his farm. The PPRO also revealed that the command was making efforts to apprehend the herdsmen who allegedly invaded the suspect’s farmland. The spokesman urged the farmers and herders to deviate from actions that could lead to violence in the state. ”On May 25, he poured insecticide into nine wells which are sources of water to residents and herds in the area. “When we collected the well water as a sample and conducted laboratory analysis, we discovered that they were contaminated with faecal coliforms, which can cause cholera, typhoid and other water-borne diseases. “Therefore, we identified and arrested the suspect today. He will be charged to court soon,” Abdulkarim said.
