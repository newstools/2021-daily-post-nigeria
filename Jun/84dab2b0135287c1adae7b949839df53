Nigerian Actor, Yemi Solade has opined that Twitter insulted President Muhammadu Buhari by deleting his tweet threatening the South East. The actor, who made this known during an interview that has now gone viral, also insinuated that the action taken by Twitter is not only an insult to the President but also to Nigerians as a whole. Solade, who further noted that Nigeria has a lot of problems to contend with and Twitter is not helping, added that when a platform is used to cause trouble or project anarchy there should be rules regulating such practices. Biafra: Twitter deletes Nnamdi Kanu’s threat to kill Nigerian soldiers ”Twitter went too far by insulting the President of Nigeria and by extension Nigerians. Some 200 million people of Nigeria, the most populous black nation on earth. ”This is not the first time Twitter will try to humiliate Nigerians. It happened to pastor Chris Oyakilome sometime in the past. ”I think the white supremacist imperialist tendencies should be curbed sometimes as much as I’m of the opinion that everybody has their rights to thought but then when a platform is used to want to cause trouble or project anarchy there should be rules regulating such practices. ”Nigeria has so many problems to contend with and Twitter wasn’t really helping,” he said. Recall that Nigerians had called for the suspension of Buhari’s account for saying ‘individuals or groups who want to destroy his government will be treated in a language they will understand.’ Following the development, on Wednesday Twitter deleted the comment, saying it violated its rules.
