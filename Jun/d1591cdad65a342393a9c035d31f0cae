Former Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, was involved in a spiky public fight with a Spanish reporter after he took offence to a question asked about his departure from the Los Blancos. Zidane walked out on Real Madrid for the second time after the 2020/21 season, where the LaLiga giants finished trophyless. The Frenchman was replaced at the Santiago Bernabeu by former Everton manager, Carlo Ancelotti. Following his departure, Zidane penned an open letter to Real Madrid supporters admitting he felt a lack of respect from certain figures at Real Madrid and no longer had the faith of president Florentino Perez. In footage obtained by Spanish publication Directo Gol TV, Zidane was approached and asked if he had any regrets about his candid letter to Real Madrid fans. Despite ignoring the initial question, Zidane then turned around and snapped back at the reporter: “Are you going to keep asking the same stupid questions? Your job is shameful. “It is always the same with you. We know each other, the same always happens. “You come here, come talk to me. You go.”
