Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has asked the club’s owner, Roman Abramovic, to make a transfer move for West Ham United’s Declan Rice this summer transfer window. The Daily Express said Tuchel has put forward his list of recommendations to the Blues’ hierarchy and one of the names proposed is Rice. The German told the Chelsea board that he would like to see the 22-year-old at Stamford Bridge in the summer, although the player’s asking price is now closer to £100 million.

Meanwhile, Tuchel recently said he would give his own opinions to Chelsea’s chiefs about their transfer targets this summer. “I have opinions about what we can add to the group to get better,” the former PSG manager said. “This is my job, and I’ll give my opinion, and I am asked my opinion, and we will do this, and sometimes opinions change. “This is also a process, and I have my ideas, of course. I’ve ideas for certain profiles. This isn’t about me wishing for this player A and B, and if they don’t come, I will get angry. This was never like this in my whole career. This will not be like this.” Chelsea offer West Ham Tammy Abraham, two others to seal Rice deal
