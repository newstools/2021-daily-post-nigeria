Nnamani who is also the Southeast representative and member National Caretaker/ Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party said the suspension was in respect of Gulak, who he described as a loyal party man. The press release stated, “In honour of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak who was gruesomely murdered recently, the circumstance and place of death, we have decided to postpone the official commissioning of our SouthEast APC Zonal Secretariat to a future date. Gunmen murder Jonathan’s ex-adviser Ahmed Gulak in Imo “Alhaji Gulak was a notable stalwart of our party and a very good friend of many of us from the SouthEast Chapter of APC. “We condemn without mincing words the murder of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak and call on security agencies to unravel the circumstances surrounding his death. “We equally condemn the uncivilized acts of destroying government properties and attacks on uniformed operatives. All utterances and conducts capable of inciting people must be discontinued,” Nnamani said.
