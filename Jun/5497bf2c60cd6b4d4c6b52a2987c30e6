Odefa, while speaking to our correspondent, said with the conclusion of the exercise and the election of Ozigbo as the candidate, the party will embark on a fence-mending mission to ensure that all aggrieved members dropped their grievances and support Ozigbo in the November 6 election. He said, “The election was largely free and fair, and as you can see, a winner has emerged. We will now go back to the drawing board to re-strategize and ensure that we win the election. “Part of what we will do is to mend fences with all aggrieved persons. We will visit all our members and broker peace between everybody, because we need to go into the coming election as one family. I assure you that PDP will take over Anambra State.” Ex-Transcorp boss, Ozigbo picks PDP ticket for Anambra Governorship election
