Bayern Munich defender, Benjamin Pavard, has backed Chelsea midfielder, N’Golo Kante, to win the Ballon d’Or this year. Pavard believes Kante deserves to win the Ballon d’Or because the 30-year-old has ‘six lungs’. The 25-year-old and Kante are both teammates with the France national team. Recall that the Ballon d’ Or was not handed out in 2020 due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking ahead of France’s Euro 2020 opener against Germany on Tuesday night, Pavard was quoted by Eurosport as saying: “N’Golo is N’Golo. The guy has six lungs. He never stops. “He’s a great guy and he proves he’s one of the best players in the world. I hope we will win the Euros to allow him to win the Ballon d’Or. He has deserved it so much for a few years. “He’s a great player. But we are not there yet.” Ballon d’Or 2021: Didier Deschamps names player to win award
