Controversial Kaduna-based Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, on Friday dismissed the insinuation that he benefits from the proceeds of banditry. Gumi described the allegation against him as unfair because he would never contemplate doing such. Speaking with DAILY POST, the controversial cleric said his allegiance to the government, security agencies and the nation should not be doubted. Gumi is well known to have access to some bandits ravaging the Northern part of the country. Bandits have made education a big challenge in the North as schools are beginning to close down due to their activities. Despite their activities, Gumi has always advocated for them. Bandits: Gumi discloses role he, Obasanjo played in release of Kaduna students The cleric once asked the Federal Government to grant amnesty to bandits just like it did to Niger Delta militants. While trying to advocate for them, Gumi had a few days ago said bandits only abduct students for money while the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, kill security operatives in the Southeast. His stance had led to the belief that he was benefitting from the ransom bandits are paid. Responding, Gumi said as a medical doctor who served in the military, he can never benefit from such proceeds. According to him, Islam prevents people from partaking in what he termed “dirty money,” so we cannot go against His preaching. He said: “As an Islamic cleric who doesn’t drink alcohol, doesn’t gamble, and preventing people from getting dirty money from corruption, prostitution, it would be unbecoming of me to take money from the proceed of this crime. Whoever thinks about that is not being fair. “Secondly, as a medical doctor who is a healer, how can I contemplate benefitting from dirty money where people lost their lives? It doesn’t sound right. “After sacrificing myself for the nation and serving in the Army, I don’t think anybody should doubt my allegiance to the state, government, security, and the nation.”
