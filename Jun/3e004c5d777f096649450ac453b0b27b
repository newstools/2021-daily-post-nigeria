The former presidential aide also faulted the President for regarding the people of Niger Republic as his cousins. In a tweet, Omokri wrote: “IPOB don’t know what they are talking about, on Twitter, I will keep It to Myself – Buhari. “You called people from Niger Republic “my first cousins”, and in the same interview, you insulted Nigerians of Southeast Igbo origin and repeated your genocidal threat to speak to them in a language they understand.
