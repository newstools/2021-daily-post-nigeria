Commercial bus drivers plying the Choba-Mile 3 route in Rivers state on Tuesday, went on rampage in protest over alleged killing of one of their members by a personnel of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps. The Civil defence officer is attached to the Rivers State Taskforce on illegal trading and motor parks. The incident took place after members of the taskforce stopped the bus driver along the Ada-George area of the state which led to an altercation. The victim popularly known as Biggie, was said to have been shot by the civil defence officer during the arguments and as he tried to resist being dragged down from his vehicle.
