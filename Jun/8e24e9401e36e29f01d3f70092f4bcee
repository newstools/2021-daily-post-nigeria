Following the increasing number of Internally Displaced Persons, birthed by attacks on Benue Communities by suspected Fulani herdsmen, Governor, Samuel Ortom has said the state is in a humanitarian crisis. The governor who stated this on Saturday in his speech to mark the 2021 Democracy Day, said the state has been managing the situation. DAILY POST recalls that reports emerged a few days ago on the level of hardship in major IDP camps in the state, pointing out that the displaced persons were sick, malnourished and many had no food. Speaking on the issue, Governor Ortom stressed that the state is overwhelmed by the challenges saying the Federal Government failed to redeem its pledges. The Governor said “the challenge is overwhelming. However, we have been managing. And we will continue to call on spirited individuals and other bodies to come to the help of IDPs. “We are really in a humanitarian crisis. The promise the federal government made has not been redeemed. “The help is more in other parts of the country than Benue. We call on our people here, no matter what you have even if little, support these IDPs.” Herdsmen attacks: Over 600,000 persons displaced in Benue
