President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday said the All Progressives Congress, APC, has been revived, energized and repositioned for its national convention and future elections. Buhari claimed APC was back to lief while commending the National Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) led by Governor of Yobe State, Malam Mai Mala Buni. Speaking at the APC CECPC meeting at the State House, the President said the fortunes of the party had been brightened by the re-organisation and reconciliation of members across the party, saying “with the work done by the committee the party has bounced back to life.’’ In a statement signed and forwarded to DAILY POST, Buhari said: “I have listened with great interest the remarkable job you have done so far. “We are all witnesses to the crisis that engulfed the party leading to litigations and presented a picture of selfishness and division.’’ President Buhari said the party structure was disturbed by the conflicts that preceded and followed various elections, noting that the secretariat had been witnessing a beehive of peaceful activities after the reconciliation. The President told members of the committee that they will continue to enjoy the support of all party stalwarts and members to complete their assignment with the actualisation of the convention and leave an “indelible footprint’’. “We want to leave behind a legacy of transparency and fairness, which the party needs to survive,’’ he added.
