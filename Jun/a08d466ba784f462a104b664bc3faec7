Enyinnaya Abaribe, Senate Minority Leader, has urged the Federal Government to respect the rights of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Abaribe, who stood as surety for Kanu, said the government should ensure he is humanely treated in custody. The lawmaker made the call in a statement entitled: “Nnamdi Kanu: Abaribe urges respect to fundamental human rights, adherence to rule of law” by his Media Adviser, Uchenna Awom. He stressed that the Federal Government should be guided by the provisions of Section 31 of the 1999 Constitution in the handling of Kanu’s matter. According to Abaribe: “The relevant section and charter presuppose that the detainee should be humanely treated while in the custody of the state. “What it means is that it is the duty of the government in this instance to protect him and ensure the respect of his fundamental human rights while his trial lasts. “For now, it is trite law, that he is presumed innocent until proven guilty.” Kanu was intercepted on Sunday and extradited back to Nigeria. The arrest of the IPOB leader was announced by the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami in Abuja on Tuesday. Same Tuesday, Kanu was re-arraigned before the Justice Binta Nyako-led Abuja Federal High Court which later remanded him in custody of the Department of State Services, DSS.
