The Court of Appeal sitting in Akure, Ondo State capital has upheld the election of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and his Deputy, Lucky Aiyedatiwa in the October 10, 2020 election. The five-man panel led by Justice Theresa Orji-Abadua gave the judgement after dismissing the appeal of Eyitayo Jegede, candidate of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in the election for lacking merit. Jegede had approached the appellate court after the tribunal on April 20, 2021, dismissed his petition challenging the nomination and election of Akeredolu and Aiyedatiwa for lacking in merit.
