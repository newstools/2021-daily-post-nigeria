A tanker loaded with fuel has exploded along Ajilete axis of the Owode-Idiroko road, Ogun State on Wednesday. The tanker, which DAILY POST learnt was conveying petrol to the border area went up in flames after it fell down and spilled its content. The inferno, it was gathered, affected traffic on the international road for hours as no immediate rescue effort came from necessary agencies. It could not be confirmed whether lives were lost in the incident that occurred early in the morning. However, in a video made available to our correspondent, an injured person was seen being rescued by eyewitnesses. The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE) has confirmed the incident to DAILY POST. TRACE spokesman, Babatunde Akinbiyi, said, “There is no any record of casualty at the moment, but if there is anything untoward, rest assured that I will keep you updated.” Watch the video below:
