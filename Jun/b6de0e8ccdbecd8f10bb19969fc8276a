The Lagos House of Assembly, on Monday, ordered Local Government Councils to stop extorting operators of courier and logistics services. This followed a debate on the forceful obtainment of money from dispatch riders and delivery vehicles. The Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa stressed that area councils have no powers to impose tax or levy on companies. Obasa said the power of the councils was limited to registration of motorcycles and tricycles as dictated by the Nigerian constitution. He condemned the cases of harassment, and admitted that such acts were against government’s policy on ease of doing business.

How much do they even charge? Local governments have nothing to do with the registration of motorcycles and tricycles. “Operators of courier and logistics services should not be made to pay in all the local governments considering what they charge for their services”, Obasa warned. The House told local government councils to be aware of their limitations and desist from using touts and street urchins to collect illegal revenues.
