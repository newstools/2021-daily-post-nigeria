A governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in Anambra State, Mrs Chidi Onyemelukwe has said the ambiguity in the Nigerian constitution is aiding the abuse of the local government system in the country. Onyemelukwe, daughter of late former Vice President of Nigeria, Dr Alex Ekwueme expressed worries over the neglect of the local government system, saying the neglect of the system, which is the third tier of government amounts to abuse. The aspirant who spoke to journalists on Sunday at Nando, Anambra East LGA during the second session of the fourth synod of the Anglican Diocese of Niger West said the recent constitution amendment could be deployed to correct the anomaly.
