Two Super Eagles players have been dropped from the initial 25 invited for the international friendly against Mexico. This was disclosed by Super Eagles Media Officer, Femi Raji, on Friday. Recall that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) had invited 25 home-based players to camp ahead of the game scheduled for July 3. Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa, was dropped from the squad last week. Raji told NAN that the players dropped were Christopher Nwaeze of Kwara United FC and Ifeanyi Anaemena of Rivers United. According to him, the team had intensified preparations for the encounter and was at the US Embassy on Friday to keep a visa appointment for the trip. “We had a visa appointment today (Friday) at the US Embassy, because of that, we didn’t train this morning. “We’ll be training this evening at the Aguiyi Ironsi Barracks. “For now, two players Christopher Nwaeze and Ifeanyi Anaemena have been dropped. “Not everybody will make the final list, and the only reason a coach can drop a player could be that he did not meet up with the standard. “In fact, they were not dropped for injuries, not indiscipline, obviously it is what the coach wants going by his strategy.” The Super Eagles are expected to depart Nigeria for the US on June 30 for the match. Recall that NFF Technical Director, Austin Eguavoen, was mandated by the football house to take charge of the game instead of Super Eagles handler, Gernot Rohr.
