As the gubernatorial election in Osun State draws nearer and with the release of the election time table by the independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has declared its readiness for the polls. In a radio current affairs programme in Osogbo on Wednesday, Oladele Bamiji, the Osun PDP Director of Media and Publicity accused the ruling party of degrading the ethics of good governance. He regretted that the APC had made the payment of workers salaries, which is routine government business, a central subject of discourse. While describing the owing of workers’ salaries as wicked and fraudulent, Bamiji decried the Adegboyega Oyetola administration for adding it to their lists of achievements. On the adoption of Senator Ademola Adeleke as the PDP candidate in the 2022 Osun Gubernatorial Election, the PDP spokesman explained that every interested aspirant was free to come and test their popularity during the party primaries in the state. Citing the 2018 PDP primary in the state where Ademola Adeleke emerged victorious though not being the candidate of the party, he denied the allegation that the party was sponsoring a sole candidate for the election. In his words, “Ademola Adeleke emerged as the PDP flagbearer in the 2018 election even though he was not the favourite to win the party primaries. “The reason for the Adeleke candidacy is not far-fetched. He was victorious in 2018 until it was stolen from Abuja. “Every aspirant must face the people in the primaries and it is possible for another aspirant to win”, he concluded. Osun APC calls out Senator Adeleke for allegedly telling lies about 2018 elections
