Facebook has announced the ban of former President Donald Trump until at least January 7, 2023. Vice President Nick Clegg on Friday said the company “will look to experts to assess whether the risk to public safety has receded.” The new date is two years from when Trump was initially suspended. Facebook will then determine whether he should be allowed back on. Clegg said that external factors, including instances of violence, restrictions on peaceful assembly and other markers of civil unrest, will be evaluated. Facebook deletes Buhari’s post against South East “If we determine that there is still a serious risk to public safety, we will extend the restriction for a set period of time and continue to re-evaluate until that risk has receded.” Facebook suspended Trump after supporters stormed the Capitol building after his address which reiterated the 2020 election President Joe Biden won was rigged. Clegg further disclosed that new rules for enforcement protocols will be applied in exceptional cases. Trump, in a statement, described the action against him an “insult” to supporters.
