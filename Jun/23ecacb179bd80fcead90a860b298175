The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State has said that it will appeal the Appeal Court judgment dismissing the petition against the declaration of Oluwarotimi Akeredolu as Governor of the State. This was contained in a statement signed by Kennedy Peretei, the State Publicity Secretary and made available to newsmen in Akure on Wednesday. Recall that the party and its candidate in the October 10, 2020 governorship election, Eyitayo Jegede, had approached the Court of Appeal to cancel Akeredolu’s election. However, the appellate court on Wednesday said in a unanimous judgment that the petition by the PDP and its candidate lacked merit. In concluding her lead judgement, Hon. Justice Theresa Orji-Abadua disclosed that the appeal was partially discharged and allowed. “To the ordinary man in the street, the judgement was inconclusive and we must approach the Supreme Court to help the Appeal Court to conclude the judgement, “the statement read in part. “The kernel of the Eyitayo Jegede/PDP petition was whether or not a gross violation of the 1999 Constitution (as Amended) should be allowed to stay. “While the Court of Appeal acknowledged that it was a violation of the Constitution, it still went ahead to dismiss the appeal. “We’re still studying the details of the judgement by virtue of the fact that it was delivered via Zoom. But we’ve sufficient grounds to appeal the decision of the court. “We’re confident the Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the land, will do justice,” he said.
