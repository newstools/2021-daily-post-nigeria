Former Super Eagles forward, Samson Siasia, has hit out at the Federal Government of Nigeria for abandoning him. He insisted that he is not getting what he deserves and was neglected by the Federal Government when it comes to his case. Siasia played for the Super Eagles from 1984-1999. He made a total of 51 appearances and scored 16 goals. The 53-year-old was among the players who won the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, title. Siasia also had two stints as a coach of the Nigeria national team. “I am a legend, I have played, broke my leg for this country, and also coached,” Siasia was quoted by AllAfrica as saying. “If I played for America – yes I have an American passport, but I played for Nigeria – if I was like Michael Jordan, [the American government] would take it upon themselves. “The Nigerian government has not done well when it comes to my case.” Meanwhile, the Federal Government approved the promise made of rewarding the 1994 Super Eagles squad with houses. DAILY POST recalls that Siasia was banned by the world football governing body for life, following a match-fixing probe. The Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) has reduced the life ban placed on former Nigerian coach, Samson Siasia by FIFA to five years. Siasia led Nigeria to two Olympic medals in men’s football.
