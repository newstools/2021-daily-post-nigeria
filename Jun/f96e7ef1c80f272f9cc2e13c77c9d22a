The Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje, has revealed that more governors elected under other political parties were getting ready to join the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ganduje stated this when he received members of the APC registration and revalidation appeals committee at the Governor’s Lodge in Asokoro, Abuja. His comments were contained in a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr Abba Anwarm on Sunday in Kano. Herders banned from South should return to Kano – Ganduje “As far as we are concerned nobody was marginalised in the exercise. For your information, there are indications that more governors are coming to our great party, the APC, from other places. Our internal democracy is waxing stronger day by day. “I want to use this opportunity to congratulate you for getting us more entrants into our party. We thank you for the good exercise conducted. This makes our party wax stronger and improves internal democracy,” Ganduje said. Ganduje also said the APC was ready to register new members, no matter their position or opinions about them. Bandits gathering in Kano forest, may attack us soon – Ganduje
