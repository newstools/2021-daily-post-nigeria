The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has confirmed the re-arrest of its leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. DAILY POST had reported that Kanu was arraigned on Tuesday, following his re-arrest and extradition to Nigeria. In a statement by Bar. Ifeanyi Ejiofor, IPOB/Nnamdi Kanu lead Counsel, he demanded that Kanu’s fundamental rights must be respected while in custody. The statement read: “We have just confirmed through a correspondence from the Federal High Court Abuja, about the arrest and the extradition of my Client- Mazi Nnamdi Kanu by the Nigerian State. It is to be noted, therefore, that no matter the gravity of the offences or charge preferred against him, Section 36(5) of the Constitution still presumes him innocent of the allegation. He was brought before the Federal High Court No 2 Abuja today on an Eleven count charge, though without our knowledge. As it is in the public domain, the matter has been consequently adjourned to the 26th Day of July 2021, for Continuation of Trial. The legal team ably led by my humble self will meet them in court on this date. We insist that he must be given a fair hearing/trial which is his constitutionally protected right. His safety as also guaranteed under our law throughout the trial and afterwards, should be enforced. Our fortified Legal team will be meeting to agree on strategies within the context of the Charge and disposition of the Court. Await further update from us as we progress. Thank you and remain blessed. Signed
Bar. Ifeanyi Ejiofor
IPOB/Nnamdi Kanu lead Counsel.
