The Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) has described President Muhammadu Buhari’s response to the deteriorating security situation in the country as unpresidential. CNG made this known while reacting to a tweet by Buhari threatening to deal with those who are out to destroy his Government. CNG Spokesman, Abdul-Azeez Sulaiman, in a statement released on Wednesday in Abuja, said the presidential tweet merely amounts to admission of failure and loss of capacity. “We find it ridiculous that most parts of the President’s tweet concentrated more on infrastructure than on the lives of citizens that are wasted daily with virtually no response from the authorities. “The President’s revelation that most of those involved in the current agitation for secession are those who have not witnessed the 1967 civil war is validates our position that the only option to ensure a more secure future is for the Igbos to be allowed to have their wish for a Biafran nation. “It is time for the Nigerian state and all stakeholders to acknowledge that the only way to avoid a civil war is for the Igbos to be allowed to have the Biafra they have used for years to. destabilize the nation,” the statement said. The CNG further urged the people of the North in any part of the country to remain calm with the assurance that they are taking steps to ensure the actualization of Biafra so the rest of the country would know peace. 39 abducted students: Aggrieved parents, Coalition of Northern Groups to stage protest
