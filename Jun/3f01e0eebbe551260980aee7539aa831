Arsenal midfielder, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, has told the club manager, Mikel Arteta, to either play him next season or sell him this summer. Maitland-Niles joined Arsenal as a youngster in 2003 and he made his professional debut for the Gunners at the end of 2014. The 23-year-old was loaned to West Brom during the 2020/21 season after struggling for playing time under Arteta. The England international had started just five times in the Premier League for Arteta’s side before he joined West Brom in the January transfer window.

I want some clarity. And then hopefully I can get to work with whoever I need to get to work with.“ Europa League: Arteta explains why Arsenal failed to qualify for final
