The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) led by Cbukwudi Umeaba and loyal to Chief Chris Uba is currently holding a separate primary election to elect a candidate to fly the party’s flag in the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State. A faction of the party is currently accrediting delegates at the Prof Dora Akunyili Women’s Development Centre. The Uba-led faction is holding its primary at the Paul University playground in Awka, with a huge mobilisation of party members. DAILY POST gathered that the event at Prof Dora Akunyili Women’s Development Centre is a faction of the party formerly led by Mr Ndubuisi Nwobu before its Executive was disbanded. Meanwhile, DAILY POST can authoritatively report that almost all the party’s aspirants are at Prof. Dora Akunyili Women’s Development Centre for the primary election, the Umeaba faction has also massively mobilized party members, but the faction was yet to receive any aspirants. Umeaba in a discussion with our correspondent at the venue said:
“We will start soon we’re waiting for our aspirants to arrive. Quite a number of them will be here soon.” A source in the party, who did not want his name in print said some members of the party are already preparing grounds that will enable them go to court to contest the election of a candidate from any faction not favourable to them. “Most of the aspirants you see in the other faction also belong to this faction. Some of the aspirants are waiting to pick the ticket of one faction, and when they can’t, they will still come here. This disunity is not good for our party,” it said.
