Southeast crisis: Onion marketers suspend supply In an interview with NAN on Wednesday, some stakeholders in the sector lamented the outcome of the decision on both farmers and buyers in the affected region. Mr Peter Dama, President of the Rice Millers Association of Nigeria (RIMAN), expressed worry over the situation saying the farmers may suffer more. He pleaded with the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment as well as the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to intervene in order to save the situation. According to him, the perishable nature of the produce would affect both the farmers and the consumers. Similarly, the Founder of Women Farmers Advancement Network (WOFAN), Mrs Salamatu Garba, said that the issue needed to be quickly attended to by the government to avoid an unpleasant outcome for the economy. She condemned the hijacking of the trucks in the south and appealed to Nigerians not to allow a few misguided elements to create problems for the majority. “The farmers are there in the communities but the middlemen who exploit the situation may be the ones working around this propaganda from both Northern and Southern Nigeria,” Garba said.
