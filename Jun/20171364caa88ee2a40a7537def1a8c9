Former Ekiti Governor, Segun Oni has said his political opponents are trying to discredit him ahead of the Ekiti 2022 governorship election. Yemi Arokodare, Director-General of his campaign, raised the alarm of blackmail in a statement at the weekend. Arokodare said the information that Oni would share political appointments before the poll was promoted by rivals. The DG noted that Oni’s track records, tradition and political philosophy was beyond sharing offices. Arokodare said the camp remains guided by the dictates of time, law, wisdom, and common sense. “We have consistently shown an uncommon fidelity to due process. By our track-records, we do not corrupt values; we thrive in the ethics of fairness, decency, and constitutionality,” he said. “The responsibility of sharing what is the collective benefit of all is that of the party and the leadership. It is wise to understand that there is time for everything.” Arokodare added that Oni respects internal party rules, electoral guidelines, and will triumph “at every phase of this journey”.
