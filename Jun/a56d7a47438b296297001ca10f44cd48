President Muhammadu Buhari has urged Nigerians to be fair to his administration. Buhari made the remark while frowning at those accusing him of double standards, with regards to pampering bandits and terrorists in the North while going hard on the Southern part of the country. Speaking on Nigerian Television Authority, NTA, the president said those accusing him of double standards are being unfair. The president insisted that his administration has not performed badly. According to Buhari: “Well, I want Nigerians to be fair to this administration. “They should reflect seriously on the time we came in especially as far as the North East and the South-South is concerned. “Where we are now, resources, how much we are producing. The previous administration before me was producing 2.1 million per day at 100 American dollars per barrel. “When we came in, militants in the South-South were unleashed on this administration and production went down to half a million barrels per day and then in the market, oil price collapsed. “I will like Nigerians to reflect on these in terms of resources in time and I believe that we have not done very badly.”
