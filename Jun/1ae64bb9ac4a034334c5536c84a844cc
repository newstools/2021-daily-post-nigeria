Elders in the Southeast have been urged to publicly denounce the ongoing attacks by the suspected members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in the region or be counted among people responsible for the dastardly acts. Former Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Assembly Matters, Alhaji Abdurrahman Sulaiman Kawu Sumaila, gave the warning in a statement he personally signed on Wednesday. According to him, “Until the southern elites make their positions known, Nigerians would consider them part of the attacks being carried out in the region by some armed militia.” Attacks on President Buhari in London, barbaric – Kawu Sumaila Sumaila added that southern elites should be mindful of their reputations by not only condemning the attacks, but also distance themselves from it, affirming that “it is only when they do this with sincerity that Nigerians will believe their innocence.” “The elites in the southeast should borrow a leaf from their northern counterparts such as Arewa Consultative Forum and Northern Elders Forum, who have been persistently condemning the activities of Boko Haram fighters and bandits in the north. “You must clear your names or else, Nigerians will consider you culprits of all the killings and destructions in some southern states. “We have no country other than Nigeria, therefore, we must do everything possible to make it peaceful.” Kwara PDP inaugurates reconciliation committee to unite party members
