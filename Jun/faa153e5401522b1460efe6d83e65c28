A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State, Dr Olusegun Osinkolu, has described the death of Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua, founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), as painful and sad. Osinkolu said Nigerians and the entire world would miss Prophet Joshua’s philanthropism and evangelistic skills that had gone global and touched the lives of many families and nation’s positively. The Director-General, Buhari/Osinbajo Campaign Council in Ekiti in the 2019 election, said this on Monday, in his condolence message, mourning the cleric. T.B Joshua confirmed dead Joshua died on Saturday evening, at the age of 57. Speaking on the death of the revered prophet, Osinkolu described Joshua’s evangelistic prowess as unrivaled . He said: “The death of Prophet TB Joshua caught all Nigerians and admirers unawares. It was painful. “Apart from being impactful in evangelism, this Cleric did excellently well in philanthropy. He served God with zeal and did well to humanity. “He appreciated the fact that his environment was largely poverty-stricken and understood that philanthropism will help in making more men closer to God and this really worked for him. “Prophet Joshua was also a thorough-bred community man. His immediate family and the entire Arigidi Akoko populace felt his generosity, in no small measure. “Though he practised his evangelism predominantly in Lagos and across the world, he never severed ties with his people in Arigidi Akoko in Ondo State. “This was a lesson that everyone would pay the supreme price . If this was the case, our leaders must learn a lesson from Prophet TB Joshua and opt to serve humanity selflessly and without pursuing personal aggrandizement. “May his soul find rest in the bosom of God, our creator”, Osinkolu prayed.
