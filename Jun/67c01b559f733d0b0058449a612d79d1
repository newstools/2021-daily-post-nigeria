President Muhammadu Buhari has said he wants the All Progressives Congress, APC, to remain in power as long as possible. The president disclosed this while reacting to the recent defection of some governors on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to APC. Speaking during an interview with the Nigerian Television Authority, NTA, Buhari said the good works of his administration would continue if APC remains in power. Buhari said: “Yes, we are preparing APC to remain in power for as long as possible. From local government to state and even to Abuja, we are the party to be in control. “We have done some things and want APC to remain in power to continue with these good works and we are going to give our party a lot of publicity so we want the party to continue.”
