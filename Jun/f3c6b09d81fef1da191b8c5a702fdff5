Former Barcelona and Chelsea striker, Samuel Eto’o, has advised former Real Madrid captain, Sergio Ramos, on the club he should join this summer. Eto’o wants Ramos to make a transfer move to Paris Saint-Germain because he would help the French Ligue 1 giants to win the UEFA Champions League. The Cameroon legend disclosed this in an interview with Spanish newspaper, AS, on Monday. DAILY POST recalls that Ramos, 35, left Real Madrid last week after spending 16 years at Santiago Bernabeu. “Hopefully, Sergio goes to PSG,” Eto’o said. “If I could sign him for Barça, I would. If he goes to PSG, I will be happy and I know that he will help us win the Champions League, which is proving very difficult for us. I am a PSG fan,” he added. Real Madrid confirm Sergio Ramos’ exit
