Second-tier Italian club, Parma have re-signed legendary goalkeeper, Gianluigi Buffon, 20 years after he joined Juventus. The 43-year-old called time on his career in Turin this season after he joined them in 2001 for €52 million, a then world record fee for a goalkeeper. “Superman returns,” Parma said in a tweet to confirm the deal.

He also holds the record for most clean sheets and most appearances in both Serie A and with the Italian national team. Although Buffon joined French side Paris Saint Germain in 2018, he returned to Juventus the following season, where he won his 10th Serie A title.
