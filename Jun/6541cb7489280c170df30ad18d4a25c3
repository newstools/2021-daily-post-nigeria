Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, is angry with Olivier Giroud after the Chelsea striker complained about the lack of service from his France teammates, L’Equipe reports. Mbappe felt ‘attacked’ and ‘angry’ following Giroud’s comments that he was unhappy with France’s lack of cohesion in attack after the World Cup champions defeated Bulgaria 3-0 in their final Euro 2020 warm-up game on Tuesday evening. Recall that France defeated Bulgaria 3-0 at Stade de France, thanks to a brace from Giroud and a strike from Antoine Griezmann. Chelsea striker, Olivier Giroud’s new club revealed “I was a little quiet because, sometimes, I make runs and the balls aren’t forthcoming,” Giroud had said after the game at his post-match press conference. “I am not saying that I always make the best runs, but I am seeking to offer solutions in the box.” France kicks off their Euro 2020 campaign against Germany next Tuesday.
