The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed has reacted to the decision of Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, to defy the ban on Twitter in Nigeria. Mohammed said the power to decide who to prosecute for using Twitter despite the ban lied with the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami. He stated this in an interview with BBC Africa Focus on Monday night, when asked if Adeboye will be prosecuted for using Twitter. Recall that Adeboye had justified his use of Twitter with Article 19 of the United Nations, UN, Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Pastor Adeboye tweets, insists RCCG will not comply with FG’s Twitter ban In a tweet, the RCCG General Overseer said the church is domiciled in over 70 countries of the world, hence the need to continue tweeting. However, Mohammed insisted that Nigerians who accessed Twitter, including Adeboye, after the ban, would be prosecuted. The minister stressed that the use of Twitter was undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence. “The government has suspended indefinitely, the operations of Twitter in Nigeria because of the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence and the government “Also directed the National Broadcasting Commission to immediately commence the process of licencing all social media operations in Nigeria. “The attorney-general has made it clear that if anyone violates the regulation, that such person will be prosecuted. I think it is the right of the attorney-general to decide who to prosecute,” he said. Meanwhile, the founder of Deeper Life Bible Church, Williams Kumuyi also disobeyed the Twitter ban.
