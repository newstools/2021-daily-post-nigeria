Human rights lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, has claimed the Federal Government is trying to cover its atrocities from the international community, with its decision to ban Twitter in Nigeria. Ozekhome said this in a statement on Friday titled, ‘When A Tottering Government Twiddles Twitter’. The Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, announced the ban on Friday. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) however noted that the current administration “has a very thin skin for criticism” and “cannot take punches, but delights in always giving punches to adversaries, real or imaginary.” Ozekhome to Southern Govs: Nigeria doesn’t need Confab Ozekhome added, “The Government knows that Nigerians now express their resentment and protest through Twitter, by telling the whole world how Nigeria has been turned into a corruption haven, and a sprawling field of butchery, extra-judicial executions and slaughtering. “Those in Government do not want the world to hear about their atrocities. So, they just gleefully tell the world that they have suspended Twitter and that they would soon license other OTT and social media operations. “These people in Government know that Nigerians have been reaching out to the whole world, and they are very embarrassed that the breeze has been blowing, and the smelly backside of the fowl is always being opened for the whole world to see and smell its odorous side.” Court stops EFCC from arresting Mike Ozekhome for criticising Ibrahim Magu
