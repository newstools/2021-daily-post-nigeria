He revealed this during an interactive session at Abubakar Rimi Television (ARTV), Monday night. Ganduje assured that he would not relent in his effort to see that Kano remains peaceful. Cross River Police decry alleged infiltration of criminals into state “We want to know how many herdsmen we have in Kano. That is why we set up a Fulani and other stakeholders committee to take a stock of all our herdsmen in the state. And even those that are not in the state presently, but are from Kano,” he said. “We want to see how we can integrate them into the larger society. They should also come and feel presence of governance. Knowing their number will help us formulate good policies for their welfare and that of the society in general,” he said. He said his commitment to a more peaceful society informed his administration’s policy of establishing Ruga Project at Dansoshiya forest. More governors will join APC soon – Ganduje
