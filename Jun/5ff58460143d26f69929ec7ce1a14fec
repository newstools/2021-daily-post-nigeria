Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has declared that hatred for the realization of Biafra by some leaders in the South- East and South-South remains irrelevant. According to him, the only relevant thing is a referendum where the Biafra agitators would be given the opportunity to decide whether to remain part of Nigeria or a separate nation. Nnamdi Kanu accused members of the National Assembly of being afraid of granting referendum over fear of actualization of the agitated Biafra nation.
