The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of being lethargic towards insecurity. PDP while condemning the killing of the Senior Special Adviser on security to the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, AIG Christopher Dega (rtd), said the body language of Buhari’s administration has emboldened insecurity in the country. Unknown gunmen had killed Dega in Jos, the Plateau State capital. Reacting to the development, PDP charged the Buhari-led government to take decisive steps in tackling insecurity. In a series of tweets on its verified Twitter handle, PDP wrote: “The @OfficialPDPNig is alarmed by the gruesome murder of the Senior Special Adviser on Security to Benue State @GovSamuelOrtom, AIG Christopher Dega (rtd) by gunmen in Jos, Plateau state capital. Murder of my security aide, Christopher Dega painful – Gov Ortom “The PDP, in very strong terms, condemns the murder of AIG Dega (rtd), describing it as barbaric as well as ominous, given the recent attempts on the life of @GovSamuelOrtom by terrorists and bandits, marauding various parts of Benue state. “The party described the slain Dega as a very patriotic Nigerian and dutiful aide, who gave his all in the service of our dear fatherland and his home state, Benue. “The @OfficialPDPNig charges the @PoliceNG to immediately go into action and follow the leads to apprehend and bring the assailants and their backers to justice. “The party also calls on President @MBuhari to end his lethargic approach to security matters and take decisive steps to end the activities of terrorists, bandits and vandals, who have been emboldened by his administration’s body language and overt failure. “The @OfficialPDPNig commiserates with @GovSamuelOrtom, the Dega family as well as the government and people of Benue State and prayed God to give all the fortitude to bear this sad episode in our national life.” ‘Those out to destroy my govt will be dealt with’ – Buhari
