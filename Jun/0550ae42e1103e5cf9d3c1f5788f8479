The federal government says the elites in Nigeria are the sponsors of those clamouring for the break up of the country. Information Minister, Lai Mohammed spoke at a meeting with the Association of Advertising Agencies of Nigeria (AAAN). Mohammed commended the body for planning the national unity campaign scheduled for October. He described the move as “patriotic” and confirmed the administration was prepared to partner with the organisers. “We must resist the temptation of some very selfish elite, who are giving the impression that Nigerians will not want to stay as a
nation,” he said. Mohammed told Nigerians not to allow anarchists to drive a wedge between them in the attempt to disorganize the nation. He admitted the challenges in the areas of security and the economy, and assured that the government is working hard to fix them.
