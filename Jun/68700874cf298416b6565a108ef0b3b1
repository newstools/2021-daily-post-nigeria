This was confirmed by the media office of the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, on Tuesday. Ighalo paid Dare a visit at the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja which is undergoing rehabilitation. “You have served this country faithfully and you will continue to be a good ambassador of this country,” Dare said. The Minister added: “Note that Principal’s Cup used to be the engine room that supplied most of our best players and it speaks to the heart of Grassroot Sports Development. To give it life, we came up with Flagship Ambassadors of the Principal’s Cup with Daniel Amokachi, Joseph Dosu, Mary Onyali, Tajudeen Disu picked as Ambassadors. You have also been appointed As National Principal’s Cup Ambassador to motivate our young students.” In his response, Ighalo said, “It’s a great privilege to see you sir, and I have been following up on what you’ve been doing, granting me a chance to see you means a lot to me. For the first time, we’ve seen sports moving forward as a business in Nigeria with your push and initiatives. Thank you so much for what you ate doing for sports development.”
