Former Big Brother Housemate, Prince, has disclosed that Tolanibaj requested 1 million Naira from him as birthday gift. Speaking during the reunion show on Friday night, Prince said that he wasn’t so good at gifting people on their birthday and that was why he asked Tbaj what she wanted on her special day. He further noted that he was a bit surprised when she requested for a million naira. “During Dorathy’s birthday, I made a post, bought her flowers and everything. Next thing, Tolani comes to my WhatsApp and starts ranting. BBNaija Reunion: Why my relationship with Tolanibaj failed – Prince “She was fuming, asking why I always take her for granted. She started asking why I did the stuff I did for Dora. “I had to caution her and equally asked her to stay away from anything that has to do with Dora and I. She even went as far as throwing shades at Dorathy online. “She also claimed that during her own birthday that I got her nothing and about the whole birthday gift thing, I don’t know how to give gifts, so when I asked her what she wanted, she asked for 1 million Naira,” he said. He, however, noted that he has made it clear countless times that they weren’t compatible after things went sour between them while reiterating that being with her was the only decision he regrets ever making.
