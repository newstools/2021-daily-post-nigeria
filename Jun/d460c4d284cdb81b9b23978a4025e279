Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has said if the Federal Government had kept its promise to recruit 10,000 Police Officers yearly, 40,000 officers would have been recruited by now. Governor Ortom who stated this on Monday, at the Benue Peoples House Makurdi while addressing personnel of the disbanded Vigilante Group, said such a number would have contributed significantly in the security architecture of the country. Former Inspector General of Police, IGP, Ibrahim Idris, in February 2017 announced that the Federal Government had approved the recruitment of 10,000 policemen yearly to address the shortfall in the numerical strength of the Force and to combat crime in the country. Governor Ortom reasoned that if that policy was carried out faithfully, the question of personnel shortfall in the Police would have been addressed.

According to the Governor, although his administration understands the sacrifices members of the Vigilante Group made in the course of doing their job, as a man who believes in the rule of law, he had to disband it. He stated that in its place, Benue State Community Volunteer Guards which was legislated for in the year 2000 would come into place, pointing out that members of the defunct Vigilante Group who have good records would also be enlisted.
