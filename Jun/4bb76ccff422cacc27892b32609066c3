The Presidency says the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has amassed a stockpile of weapons, bombs across the country. The President’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, stated this in a statement in Abuja on Saturday. Shehu, who was reacting to the removal of President Muhammadu Buhari’s tweets by Twitter and subsequent mixed reactions from members of the public, said the IPOB killed policemen and set government property on fire. According to him, the Buhari administration will continue to safeguard all citizens against social media’s disruptive and divisive influences. Nigerian military bombing, secretly killing Igbos – Nnamdi Kanu alleges Shehu said,” IPOB is proscribed under Nigerian law. Its members murder innocent Nigerians. ” They kill policemen and set government property on fire. Now, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country.” ” Twitter does not seem to appreciate the national trauma of our country’s civil war. This government shall not allow a recurrence of that tragedy,” he added. Recall that Twitter had on Wednesday deleted Buhari’s tweet for violating its rules.
