Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, wants to add both Jack Grealish and Harry Kane to his squad this summer, ESPN reports. Aston Villa captain Grealish is set to start for England in their Euro 2020 opening game against Croatia on Sunday. City believe they can land the 25-year-old after the competition, with Villa expected to demand £100million. Guardiola has been a long-term admirer of Grealish and has publicly admired the player’s ability in the past. Grealish has a deal until 2020, but City will be encouraged by the arrival of Emiliano Buendia at Villa Park from Norwich City in a £33m club record move. The Spaniard is also determined to find a world-class replacement for Sergio Aguero who has since signed for Barcelona as a free agent. England captain Kane is the club’s No. 1 target for that position. EPL: Jack Grealish chooses Manchester City
