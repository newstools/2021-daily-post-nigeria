Founder and senior pastor of the Champions Royal Assembly, Joshua Iginla has reacted to the unfortunate death of the leader of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua popularly known as TB Joshua. TB Joshua who died on Saturday night had a prayer session with the Emmanuel TV partners in his church hours before his death. Several Nigerians including the presidency have reacted to the sudden death as many expressed belief that he has been called to rest by God himself. In his reaction, Prophet Joshua Iginla said TB Joshua has embarked on a journey to heaven and is being welcomed by the angels. This was contained in a statement he posted on his official Facebook page on Sunday evening. While recognising the deceased, Inginla said the late prophet had fulfilled his divine assignment on earth. He said TB Joshua lived for the less privileged persons who depended on him for their needs. He said, “You took a bow to the sovereignty of God. After you lived your life selflessly serving in the kingdom of God, you lived for the poor, homeless, widows, orphans and the afflicted. You stood for the Prophetic, defended and supported the course until the end. I will surely miss our long private kingdom discussion. “I celebrate you and please, My heartfelt sympathy goes to the entire SCOAN FAMILY as a whole. As my brother, Prophet T.B JOSHUA takes his personal race to the finish line, A gentle walk to Heaven’s gate, with the soft voices of angels welcoming him home”.
