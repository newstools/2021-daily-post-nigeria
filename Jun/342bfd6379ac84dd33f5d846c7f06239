Details of Manchester United’s contract for Aston Villa goalkeeper, Tom Heaton, has emerged. Heaton will undergo his medical with Manchester United this week. The 35-year-old will then sign a contract with the Red Devils that will see him remain at Old Trafford until June 2023. This was revealed by respected Italian transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, via his Twitter account. Romano tweeted: “Tom Heaton will undergo his medical with Manchester United this week, then he’ll sign the contract until June 2023 + one more season option. Done, completed and here we go confirmed. “Official announcement expected in July.” DAILY POST recalls that Man United have already agreed to a deal to sign Heaton after holding talks with the Aston Villa star some weeks ago. Heaton began his career at Man United, signing as a trainee in 2002 and making a series of appearances for the club’s youth teams. He failed to make a senior appearance for Man United and after several loan spells away from the club, he eventually joined Cardiff City on a free transfer in 2010. The former England shot-stopper will bring quality back-up and competition for Man United’s keepers as they already have David de Gea and Dean Henderson in a fierce battle to be the club’s number one goalkeeper.
