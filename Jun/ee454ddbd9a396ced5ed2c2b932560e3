The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan has disclosed why President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress, APC, administration failed to deliver their electoral promises in their first tenure. Lawan said Buhari and APC failed due to the face-off between the Executive and National Assembly. He explained that the face-off stalled Buhari and the APC from delivering most of their electoral promises to Nigerians. The Senate President disclosed this at the First Progressives Youth Conference 2021, on Monday night in Abuja. 2023 presidency: Buhari won’t extend his tenure by one hour – Tinubu
He said, “When we were voted in 2019 as leaders of the National Assembly, we were conscious of one thing, that our mandate that was given to us by Nigerians in 2015 had suffered disruption and dislocation. “For four years (2015 to 2019), our government could not perform optimally because of the then crisis between the parliament – the National Assembly – and the Executive arm of government. “So, APC had already lost four very important years. And, that was supposed to be the year that we should have convinced Nigerians that they took the right decision by voting out a PDP administration in 2015.” The immediate past National Assembly-led by Senate President Bukola Saraki had some major feuds with the Buhari administration. APC had accused the Saraki-led National Assembly of deliberately working against the Buhari’s administration. The crisis had made the former APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole to threaten Saraki. Oshiomhole had vowed to impeach Saraki and ensure that he never returned to the Senate.
