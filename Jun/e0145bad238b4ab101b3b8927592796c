France has suffered a double major injury blow ahead of their Euro 2020 round of 16 tie against Switzerland on Monday. France coach, Didier Deschamps, is facing a crisis in attack after watching two of his wingers Marcus Thurman and Thomas Lamar limp out of training on Thursday ahead of the Switzerland clash. Both players appeared to be in serious discomfort during a recovery session after France’s 2-2 draw with Portugal on Wednesday. Thuram appeared to hold his groin as he sank to the floor during the session, while Lemar needed to be helped off the pitch by staff and had his head in his hands as he hobbled away from the action. The pair have the weekend to recover ahead of the Euro 2020 round of 16 tie clash with Switzerland. Should both players fail to prove their fitness, however, Deschamps will be left light in attack, having already lost Ousmane Dembele due to injury. Dembele suffered a knee injury during France’s 1-1 draw with Hungary last Saturday. Euro 2020: Italy, Wales through to knockouts, Switzerland face nervous wait
