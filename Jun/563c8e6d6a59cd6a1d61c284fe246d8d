Prophet Segun Adebayo of Christ Apostolic Church, CAC, has said God has rejected ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo. Prophet Adebayo said God rejected Obasanjo because he failed to use the opportunity he was given to clean up Nigeria’s mess in 1999. Addressing reporters in Lagos, the cleric said Obasanjo was disobedient to God and “the grace has left him”. He also predicted a crisis in the North that would wipe out President Muhammadu Buhari’s people. The prophet said: “The Lord sent the hosts of heaven with many swords. The swords have not gone back. There will be a crisis in the North; the people of Buhari will be no more. Where is the generation of Murtala Mohammed? “Obasanjo was a beloved of God but he was disobedient. The grace has left him. When he got there in 1999 was when he was given the opportunity.” The CAC prophet accused the former president of not listening to God’s instructions. “That was when we gave Obasanjo the grace to rectify what was wrong. And we told him, he did not listen. What they wanted to eat did not let them listen. Solution will not come from him again,” he added.
