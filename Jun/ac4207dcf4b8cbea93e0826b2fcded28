Chuks Ibegbu, a chieftain of the Igbo apex socio-political organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has berated Nigerians for suggesting that President Muhammadu Buhari may extend his tenure in 2023 due to insecurity. Ibegbu, a former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze, described Nigerians suggesting that Buhari would extend his tenure as “idle.” There are claims that Buhari may harp on insecurity to extend his tenure. Olusegun Bamgbose, Esq., National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, had said Buhari will remain in power in 2023. Bamgbose said the president will use insecurity as an excuse not to hand over power in 2023. Reacting, Ibegbu said Nigeria operates a constitutional democracy, hence Buhari is expected to adhere to the law. Speaking with DAILY POST, Ibegbu said: “My problem is that many Nigerians are idle minded, Buhari has a tenure and term that ends on May 29, 2023, and he has not told Nigerians that he would pursue a third term. “Nigerians are ‘busy-body kind of people,’ which is why we are in trouble. Nigerians keep on theorizing things that are unnecessary because they are idle. The man has a tenure that ends on May 29, 2023, so why are people making such claims. “Are we in a Banana Republic? We are in a constitutional democracy and not in a state of war unless there is no election for any reason. And if there is no election for any reason, we can now call for a state of emergency. “However, we have a lot of anarchists in Nigeria, both North, East, West, everywhere, who are against us having peace. In the North, Boko Haram and bandits are there; they are anarchist groups; also, we have anarchists in the South, except they decide to strike, but Buhari has a tenure that ends on May 29, 2023.” Biafra: Igbos can leave Nigeria – Northern elders on war threats
