Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa, is the biggest absentee from Gernot Rohr’s squad for next month’s international friendly with Mexico in the US. Heartland goalkeeper, Ikechukwu Ezenwa, has however been recalled to the team. Ezenwa’s last call-up for Nigeria was in October 2019, as they drew 1-1 with Brazil. The Super Eagles’ friendly against the Tricolor will take place on July 3 at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. However, Nigeria will be parading only Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) stars. Even though Musa now plays for Kano Pillars, he has not been invited. Others invited for the clash against Mexico are Enyimba goalkeeper John Noble, Rivers United’s Ifeanyi Anaemena, Enugu Rangers’ Ibrahim Olawoyin and Kwara United’s Stephen Jude. The invited players are expected to report at the Serob Legacy Hotel, Wuye, Abuja on Tuesday, June 22. However, only 22 players will make the trip to the USA.
