Arsenal is set to bring Benfica left-back, Nuno Tavares, to Emirates this summer. The Premier League club has made the first move in the race to sign Tavares from Benfica. The Gunners view Tavares as a new backup to Kieran Tierney. According to Fabrizio Romano, Arsenal has been in contact with the player’s agents, with Benfica hoping for £14.5 million. Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, is keen to add competition for Tierney at left-back after the Scotland international signed a new long-term contract with the North London club last week. Tavares currently has three years left in his contract with Benfica. The 21-year-old has gone on to make 41 appearances for Benfica.
