Jose Mourinho has insisted he won “half a trophy” at Tottenham Hotspur, after he was denied the chance to lead the team out in the Carabao Cup final. The Portuguese was sacked by Spurs just days before they lost 1-0 to Manchester City at Wembley. Ryan Mason took charge of the game, having been installed as a caretaker manager. Mourinho’s time at Tottenham was the first of his illustrious career that did not see him win silverware, following successes at Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Manchester United.
