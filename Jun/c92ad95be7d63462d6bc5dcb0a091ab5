Lukaku said this ahead of Belgium’s Euro 2020 round of 16 tie against Portugal on Sunday night. The Inter Milan forward believes he should be recognised as one of the best strikers in the world. Lukaku has so far scored 63 goals in 96 games for Belgium. “People have tended to describe things this way,” Lukakau said at his pre-match press conference. “When they talk about [Robert] Lewandowski, [Karim] Benzema, [Luis] Suarez, [Harry] Kane, they would say it’s world class level and with me it is always about being in good form. “In the last two years I think I have shown it’s not just good form. “I belong with that group, I am at that level.” Lukaku is amongst a host of players that have scored three goals at the ongoing Euro 2020. He is currently the tournament’s joint second-top scorer along with Robert Lewandowski. The 28-year-old has one more goal than Benzema and three more than Kane. who is yet to score at the tournament.
