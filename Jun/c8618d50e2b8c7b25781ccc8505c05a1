The Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, has claimed he has received death threats since he assumed office. Bawa explained that it is the case of corruption fighting back. He stated this on Tuesday, while answering questions on Channels Television’s ‘Sunrise Daily’ programme. “Last week, I was in New York, as all Nigerians are aware of. A very senior citizen received a phone call from somebody that is not even under investigation. What he (the caller) said to him on the phone is that; he is going to kill the EFCC chairman, the young man. EFCC boss, Bawa threatens to resign “He said, ‘I am going to kill him. I am going to kill him’. This is to tell you how bad it is. It is actually real. Corruption can fight back.” When further asked if he meant he has been receiving death threats, the EFCC boss said, “Yes”. President Muhammadu Buhari had in February 2021 named 40-year-old Bawa as the new EFCC chairman. He replaced the embattled ex-acting chairman of the anti-graft commission, Ibrahim Magu.
