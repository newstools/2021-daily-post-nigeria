The senior pastor of The Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has said nothing can stop the disintegration of Nigeria. Giwa made the remark while accusing Lord Lugard of merging Nigeria to pave way for Fulanis to control the country. In a statement he forwarded to DAILY POST, Pastor Giwa said: “The first Governor-General of Nigeria, Federick John Lugard did a horrible thing to have joined the country together to pave the way for Fulanis to control everyone. “The foreigners have hijacked the resources meant for the sons of the soil. Fredrick Lugard gave the Northerners the keys to Nigeria. White people don’t like those who are smart enough to question them. Biafra, Oduduwa: Real enemies of Nigeria won’t support disintegration – Pastor Giwa “Fredrick Lugard saw Northerners as fools that the white people could control, and that was the reason why he handed over the leadership of Nigeria to them. To date, the British still control our resources, we pay dues to them. Lugard joined us together, his wife named the country, what a horrible combination! Now, back to the situation within. “Aside from Northerners themselves, if an Igbo man becomes the president today, he will still worship the Fulanis. The permanent solution to this is to change the name, Nigeria and let us have a new nation with a new constitution. “Either President Buhari likes it or not, God shall free His children from oppressors and tormentors. They have inflicted several mental or physical sufferings on the citizens of Nigeria.” Decision to remain as one Nigeria can not be determined by Lugard – Nnamdi Kanu
