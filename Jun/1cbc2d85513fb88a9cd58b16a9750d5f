Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State and his Imo State counterpart, Governor Hope Uzodinma, have lauded former Senate President, Senator Ken Nnamani for the growth of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the South-east. They stated this when they paid a working visit to the South-east APC Secretariat in Enugu State. The governors, who are themselves APC members, were at the secretariat to inspect the pace of work, which was due for commissioning two weekends ago, but was disrupted by the death of a leader of the party in Imo State, Hon Ahmed Gulak.
