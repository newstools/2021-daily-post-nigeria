While commiserating with the Islamic group and the family of the Islamic cleric who was killed during the incident, Oyetola reiterated that the state is not known for such dastardly acts. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, Oyetola noted that Osun and her people were known for peace and that the present administration had been doing all it could to sustain the state’s enviable record. The Governor warned that government would not tolerate any act of criminality or violence in any part of the state. “The clash and the death are condemnable to say the least and are at variance with the peaceful status of Osun. We are known for peace. We have been doing our best to preserve that enviable status and we will do everything to guard it jealousy. “After our visit to the scene of the incident on Monday, we have directed the Police to swing into action and bring the perpetrators to book. “Once again, we commiserate with the family of the deceased and the Qamarudeen Islamic Society over the death of their member but we want to reiterate that government will get to the root of the matter. The perpetrators must be brought to book to prevent future occurrence and serve as a deterrent to others.”
