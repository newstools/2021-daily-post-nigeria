The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has removed 749 polling units from inappropriate facilities. The commission removed nine polling units from shrines and several others from religious houses, royal palaces, and private properties. INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu made this known on Wednesday in Abuja at a meeting with Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs). He, however, did not give reasons for the action. Presently, Nigeria has 176, 846 full-fledged polling units from the initial 119, 973 polling units. This is as a result of the recent conversion of existing voting points to units by the commission.
