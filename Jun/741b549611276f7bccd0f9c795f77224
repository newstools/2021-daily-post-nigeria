Germany midfielder, Toni Kroos has wished Cristiano Ronaldo all the best after his country defeated Portugal 4-2 at the Euro 2020 over the weekend. Kroos also said he asked Ronaldo how he was doing in Italy. The 31-year-old and Ronaldo were teammates at Real Madrid for four seasons before the forward left Santiago Bernabeu for Juventus. Recall that Ronaldo’s first-half goal was not enough as Germany defeated Portugal at Allianz Arena on Saturday, thanks to goals from Ruben Dias (OG), Raphael Guerreiro (OG), Kai Havertz and Robin Gosens. “I played with him [Ronaldo] for four seasons,” Kroos told the Einfach mal Luppen podcast. “We were neighbours in the dressing room, so of course, I was glad to see him again. “We spoke briefly about the game [Portugal vs Germany], of course, but also about the matches that are to come. I wished him the best of luck and asked him how he was doing in Italy.” Kroos also revealed he spoke with another former club teammate, Pepe, with whom he played for three seasons at Real Madrid. He added, “Pepe is also an outstanding guy who sometimes seems very wild on the pitch. “He doesn’t seem so nice on it, but he is totally nice off the pitch. “It’s exactly the same with Cristiano Ronaldo.” Real Madrid midfielder, Toni Kroos contracts COVID-19</a
