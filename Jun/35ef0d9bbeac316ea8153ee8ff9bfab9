Villarreal centre-back, Pau Torres, has insisted that he is ‘totally calm’ about his situation after being asked directly about Manchester United’s interest in signing him this summer. Torres has been heavily linked with a summer move to Manchester United. The 24-year-old is on Man United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s shortlist of players to sign, and the Premier League giants have made the signing of a central defender one of their priorities this summer. The Spain international has a release clause of £51million, but Man United are hoping to lower that figure in negotiations. Asked about Man United’s interest in signing him, Torres, who is currently at the Euro 2020 with Spain national team, told Goal, “I have a contract at Villarreal, I just won the first title for the club, we have qualified for the Champions League and it is something that excites me a lot. “Now I am focused on the Euros. Then the Super Cup and nice things will come, so I am totally calm.”
