The Anambra State Government has refuted reports of the return of Bakassi Boys security outfit in the state. Don Adinuba, the state’s Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, said the state government would not allow Bakassi operate in the state. A video had surfaced online of some youths dressed in red wielding weapons with the claim that Bakassi Boys have returned to Awka. However, the Commissioner said the said video was efforts by youths to rid the state of cultists and not Bakassi Boys. Biafra Day: Buhari govt cut-off network in Bakassi Peninsula – BNL
Adinuba said cultists were trying to capitalize on the short fall of policemen in Awka. The Commissioner, however, assured that Anambra State was the safest state in Nigeria despite security challenges. According to Adinuba: “An unidentified amateur video photographer has made a video claiming that the controversial security outfit known as Bakassi Boys, which was two decades ago used in Abia and Anambra states when the two neighbouring states were almost overrun by violent criminals, is back, this time in Awka, the Anambra State capital. “The video quickly went viral because of its sensational appeal. A section of even the mainstream media has publicized the video, thus giving it a veneer of credibility. “The Bakassi Boys security outfit is not in Anambra State, and will not be used again in the state.

“The people and Government of Anambra State are proud of the record of security agencies in the state which have substantially overcome the challenges of the last few months. “What some members of the public innocently confused with Bakassi Boys’ return to the state is a noble effort of some Awka indigenes to fish out cultists in the community who have attempted to capitalize on the inadequate number of policemen on patrol in the town in the last few months to fight themselves with dangerous weapons.”
