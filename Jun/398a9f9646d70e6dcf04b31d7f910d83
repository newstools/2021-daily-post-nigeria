He also said he was turned off after he found out Tolanibaj showed interest in Neo who happened to be her friend’s man. Prince said: “I did like Tolanibaj but She was never satisfied with all my actions and everything I did. “She wanted me to spend more time with her. I tried to do that and be nicer but she wasn’t satisfied. It was almost as if it was draining me at the time. “No matter how much I tried, it was as if nothing I ever did pleased her. “She wanted me to stop talking to other people because of how she felt about them and I just couldn’t. “And later, I found out that while I was trying to figure out how to work things out between us, you were busy looking at your best friend’s man in the house. What does that speak of you?”
