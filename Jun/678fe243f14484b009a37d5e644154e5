Joe Igbokwe, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has celebrated the rearrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Igbokwe, who said Kanu’s arrest indicated that it’s all over, said Nigerians now understand why President Muhammadu Buhari postponed his medical trip to London. The Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Drainage and Water Resources made the remark while celebrating the rearrest of Kanu. In a series of posts on his Facebook page, the APC chieftain prayed that the souls of those lost in the Southeast will now rest in peace. He wrote: “Nnamdi Kanu, it is all over. “To God be the glory. May the souls of hundreds of young men who lost their lives in the Southeast rest in perfect peace. Amen! An endless alleluia!!! “You can now understand why PMB postponed his UK visit last week.” Kanu was arrested on Sunday and extradited to Nigeria to continue his trial. Upon arrival in Nigeria, he appeared before Justice Binta Nyako-led Federal High Court in Abuja who ordered that he should be remanded in custody of the Department of State Services, DSS. Meanwhile, some unknown persons had recently burnt Igbokwe’s house. ‘Dot Nation’ shirt: Joe Igbokwe, Onochie are slaves, will be dumped soon – Biafra group
