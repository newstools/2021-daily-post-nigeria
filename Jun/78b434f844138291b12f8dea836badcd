President Muhammadu Buhari has charged troops of the Joint Task Force at Maimalari Cantonment parade ground in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, to put in more efforts in the fight against insecurity ravaging the Northeast and other parts of the nation. Buhari gave the charge on Thursday during his one-day visit to the state. DAILY POST had reported that the president arrived the Nigerian Air Force Base in Maiduguri at about 10am on Thursday. Buhari assured the armed forces of more procurement of armaments. “We should not allow our adversaries or criminal elements to undermine our sovereignty.” “While I commend you, let me tell you that there is still a lot of work to be done in the North East, West and entire country.” The president was subsequently directed to the place where injured soldiers were being treated to sympathise with them. Buhari is also expected to commission some projects executed by the state governor, Babagana Umara Zulum. Boko Haram: Nigerian troops foil attack on Maiduguri, kill 9 terrorists
