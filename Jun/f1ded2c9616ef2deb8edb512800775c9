Senate President Ahmad Lawan, on Monday predicted that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would suffer challenges after President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure elapses in 2023. He made the prediction on Monday night while delivering a speech to close the First Progressives Youth Conference 2021 which was held at the International Conference Centre, in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The Senate President urged the party members to plan ahead of Buhari’s exit in a bid to sustain the goodwill and legacies of the present administration, stressing that only such a move would keep the party relevant beyond 2023.

According to Lawan, “Whether we like it or not, the truth is, President Muhammadu Buhari remains the person with the bulk of the support we get across this country in APC. “And when he leaves, he will still have some roles, but I daresay that it is after he leaves office that APC will face its challenge. “Yes, we have to know our value then, and the value of APC presently is APC minus President Muhammadu Buhari. Whatever it is, that is the value of APC. “So, we need to do a lot to build this party, and we need our youths more than ever before for them to continue with this legacy that this administration has established all over the country”. He tasked the members on unity and cooperation, saying there was a need for them to eschew tribalism and other differences for the betterment of the party. Lawam admitted that it was currently the responsibility of the party to provide security and a good economy for Nigerians to live a meaningful life.
