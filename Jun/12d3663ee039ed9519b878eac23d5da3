The PDP Governors’ Forum has insisted that President Muhammadu Buhari’s spokespersons are his greatest undoing as President of Nigeria. The governors, in a statement by the Director-General of the forum, Hon. C.I.D. Maduabum, on Thursday, said that the current crop of presidential spokespersons are not representing Buhari in a proper manner. The Governors’ Forum was responding to a statement issued by presidential spokesperson Garba Shehu earlier this week. They also criticized him on his position on the ongoing Twitter ban in Nigeria. Recall that Shehu had been responding to a communique put out by the PDP Governors’ Forum on Monday. He also claimed that the opposition used Twitter to circulate fake news. “There is no doubt that President Buhari’s spokespersons are his greatest undoing as a President,” the PDP Governors’ statement read in part. “They do not represent or position him well. “The PDP Governors’ Forum Communique in Uyo was patriotic, well thought out and offered solutions to the myriad of problems facing the nation. Mr President and the APC-led Federal Government should listen.” Buhari greater threat to one Nigeria than Nnamdi Kanu, Sunday Igboho – Reno Omokri
