A former Chief Whip in the Oyo State House of Assembly, Hon. Abiodun Adigun-Hammed, has advised Governor Seyi Makinde to take necessary action in order to address security challenges facing the state. Adigun-Hammed urged Makinde to stop accepting failure over the current security challenges in the state. DAILY POST recalls that Makinde had yesterday urged people of Ibarapa geo-political zone to hold him responsible for the recent attack in Igangan. DAILY POST gathered that about twenty people were killed during the attack which was carried out between Saturday night and Sunday morning. Adigun-Hammed has, however, asked Makinde to stop accepting his failure. He urged Makinde to take action in combating insecurity facing the state. He added that other cities and towns in the state are still witnessing security challenges. The former lawmaker said the issue of insecurity is not limited to Igangan in Ibarapaland but Oyo State in general.
“Gentlemen of the press, it is saddened and disheartening that our state has degenerated to the level that nobody is safe again. Our people cannot sleep with their two eyes closed again. “The insecurity is not limited to Igangan alone but in the nooks and crannies of Oyo state. From Beere to Olodo, from Ojo to challenge. No place is safe. “We heard that the giant stride made by other southwest governors is nothing to Makinde. Our Amotekun corps are not funded as other southwest governors. “Many of you journalists are also aware of the challenges facing us in the state. “Please talk so that Makinde can do something. We cannot continue this way. “Our people are wiser and intelligent than making political statements on insecurity. If our security agencies are well equipped, all these won’t happen.”
