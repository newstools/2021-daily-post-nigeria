Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has called on the presidency to urgently consider the reversal of the ban on Twitter operation in the country to reassure the international community that Nigeria has not become a hostile country to investors. The governor described the Federal Government’s decision as an ill-advised diversion from the core issues of insecurity and injustice plaguing the nation. This was contained in a statement issued on Sunday by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase. According to the statement, the governor said the Twitter ban offers no solution to any of the myriad of problems facing the country, and stresses that the move is only capable of heightening tensions and fueling suspicions among Nigerians over the real motives of the Federal Government.
