Igboho said he would comb Southwest forest to ensure that Fulanis are evicted from the region. He insisted that Fulanis would not be allowed to overrun the Southwest. Speaking in Yoruba, Igboho said: “How can six million Fulani people be commanding about 250 million other Nigerians? “Tell President Buhari, if he doesn’t understand Yoruba; tell him in English Language that we don’t want Fulani bandits in our zone again. “Work has begun already and I will begin combing all forests in Yoruba land. “I want all Fulani on Yoruba land to leave. I will monitor compliance with the eviction notice. I don’t issue an order without ensuring compliance. “As from Monday, we don’t want to hear of any kidnapping in Yorubaland again. I will show them the stuff Yoruba people are made of.
