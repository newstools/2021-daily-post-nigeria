Femi Fani-Kayode, a former minister of aviation, has issued a warning to Nigerian Army Chiefs following the conviction of Serbian General, Ratko Mladic. Mladic, a Bosnian Serb, who led the army of Republika Srpska, VRS, during the Yugoslav war was convicted of war crimes by the International Criminal Court, ICC and sentenced to life in prison. He was found guilty of committing war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY). ICC sentences Ugandan LRA commander to 25 years in prison And reacting to the ruling, Fani-Kayode warned that the “confirmation of the life sentence of Serbian Gen. Ratko Mladic at the International Court for Criminal Justice (ICC) should send shivers down the spines of those in charge of the security forces in Nigeria that have committed similar crimes over the last six years. “Mladic never thought he would be brought to justice but he was. He committed war crimes & crimes against humanity such as ethnic cleansing, mass murder & genocide between 1992 & 1996 during the Yugoslavian civil war in which over a hundred thousand defenceless civilians including women & children were butchered.

“25 years later he was brought to justice & he is paying for his barbaric crimes. The commanders of the Nigerian Army & the political leaders that ordered mass murder, ethnic cleansing & genocide in our country will suffer the same fate sometime in the future. “No matter how long it takes, justice will be done and they will pay a terrible price for their barbaric behaviour and their cruelty, evil and wickedness,” the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP chieftain tweeted.
