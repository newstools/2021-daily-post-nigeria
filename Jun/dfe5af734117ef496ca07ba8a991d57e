Usifo Ataga: ‘All Sugar daddies return to base, one man down’ – Nigerians react Reacting, Fani-Kayode in a tweet via his Twitter account on Saturday said Mr Ataga didn’t deserve to die the way he did just because he slept with a 21-year-old. He also disagreed with the ideology of some Nigerians that Super TV Boss, Uwaifo Ataga deserved to be killed by his side chick because he was cheating on his wife. The former Minister opined that just because Ataga went to a hotel to sleep with a lady does not mean he should be butchered. According to him, Ataga was killed just because he had a high libido. “Mr Ataga was butchered.Just because he went to sleep with a 21-year- old woman doesn’t mean he deserves to die like that. “He was slaughtered and gutted like a pig in an abattoir simply because he had high libido and some are trying to rationalize it. Shame on y’all,” he wrote.
