The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has refuted reports of cancelling the All Progressives Congress, APC, governorship primaries in Anambra State. The Chief Press Secretary to INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, urged Nigerians to ignore such reports which he described as false. Speaking with the Nation, Oyekanmi said any INEC’s statement not signed by Festus Okoye should be disregarded. He said: “When we issue a statement you know the source, Festus Okoye signs our official statement, have we issued any official statement saying that any political party has been disqualified?” “Another thing you should know, is that if we send people to monitor primaries of political parties, they are expected to write report but that report is not for public consumption, it is supposed to be internal report and even anyone is found acting on that report, he should be arrested because he stole the report.” Anambra election: PDP, APGA give APC advantage as crisis hits parties
