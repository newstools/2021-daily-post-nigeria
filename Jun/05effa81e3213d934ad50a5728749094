There was low turnout of voters across polling units in Jigawa State as the 2020 local government elections held on Saturday, 26 June, 2021. A DAILY POST correspondent observed that the election officers and sensitive materials arrived early and the election started at 8:00AM at some poling units especially across the main headquarters of the 27 local governments while in some villages and hard to reach areas, the election didn’t commence at 8:00AM. The electoral officers were seen sitting idle in most of the polling units as a result of low turnout of voters who preferred to engage in other activities. A resident in Babura told DAILY POST that he prefers to go for his own business rather than casting his vote because there is no strong contest in the election. DAILY POST reported that the major opposition party in the state People’s Democratic Party (PDP) said it only fielded six candidates for the Local Government election because they could not afford to buy the interest and nomination forms. The local governments include; Birnin Kudu, Kiyawa, Hadejia, Auyo, Kirikasamma, Mallam Madori. Chairman of the state Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC), Adamu Ibrahim, said he was satisfied with the process and turnout of the election. Governor Badaru Abubakar casted his vote in Babura kofar Arewa 001 poling unit at about 1:20PM. 2023: INEC launches online portal for voters to register
