Nigeria singer, Olubankole Wellington, popularly known as Banky W, has described as ”clueless” the Federal government’s decision to suspend Twitter operations in the country. Banky in a series of tweets via his Twitter account said the government cannot stop kidnapping and other vices plaguing the country but they can come out to ban Twitter. He further urged Nigerians to shun voting any politician older than 65 into power during the 2023 elections since the retirement age in Nigeria is 65. “Nigerian Government banned Twitter, and announced the ban ON Twitter. You can’t make this up. Clueless. “They can’t stop kidnapping, armed robbery and terrorism, the country is as unsafe as ever and yet they can seize passports and block bank accounts of peaceful protesters. Twitter ban: ‘Buhari govt has lost it’ – Nnamdi Kanu “They ban cryptocurrency. They ban Twitter. Completely out of touch with the plight of young people. “The retirement age in Nigeria is 65. Regardless of party if you’ll be over 65 at the time of elections, we won’t vote for you. It’ll at least eliminate an entire group that has had enough opportunities to fix this mess. “Can we consider doing #NowToOldToRule? If you’re over 65, you’ve had your chance to help fix this mess. Isn’t it time for that entire generation to rest? The Nigerian Government should not be a retirement home. It’s worth a thought. It’s worth a shot,” he wrote.
