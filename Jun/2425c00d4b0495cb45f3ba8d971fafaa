President Muhammadu Buhari has claimed that last year’s EndSARS protests against police brutality, were aimed at removing him from office. Buhari stated this while appearing on Arise TV on Thursday morning. He also blamed the protests on the dwindling inflow of foreign direct investment to the country. The president insisted that those who participated in the protests, have made Nigeria unattractive to investors. Buhari was asked how he can improve foreign direct investment (FDI) to Nigeria. In response he said: “This question was answered last year when there was the #EndSARS protest last year. You remember the young people that wanted to march here and remove me?” The president added: “Tell the young people to behave themselves and make the country safe, then we can attract real investors to the country”.
