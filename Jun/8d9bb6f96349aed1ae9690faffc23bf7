Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has maintained that security operatives cannot infiltrate camps of the Eastern Security Network (ESN). Kanu made the remark while refuting claims by security agents of destroying ESN camps. The IPOB leader said security agents made up such claims to deceive Nigerians and collect money from the government. Speaking through IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful, Kanu described such claims as propaganda. A statement by Powerful reads partly: “We equally want to put it on record that the purported camps destroyed by security agents are not ESN camps. The false claims were to create the wrong impression that they are working hard and probably collect more money from their stupid Government. Police invade three ESN camps, arrest kingpins in Imo “The fact remains that ESN camps cannot be infiltrated or combed by the Nigeria security agents. They are only out for propaganda to deceive the gullible into thinking that ESN is vulnerable, they are not. The wicked Nigeria security agents attacked the home of a Sabatarian in Imo some time ago and tagged him the commander of ESN and his compound as ESN camp. “Those who claimed a native doctor preparing charms for ESN are not IPOB or ESN security operatives. It’s unfortunate that it’s only in Biafra land that the weak and hypocritical Nigeria security agents zealously destroy the houses of native doctors but they are unable to locate native doctors preparing charms for terrorists, bandits and Fulani herdsmen. “The public must disregard this junk news being dished out by the Nigeria police and Imo Supreme Court Administrator, Hope Uzodinma about the beheading of a native doctor from Imo state by IPOB and ESN.” IPOB, ESN not unknown gunmen – Nnamdi Kanu insists
