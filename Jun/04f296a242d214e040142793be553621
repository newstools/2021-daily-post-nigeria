The lawmaker had said the Nigerian Government will not bow to the demands of ‘insurgents’ in the Southeast. Biafra: Buhari declared war against S/East, we’ll defend ourselves – Nnamdi Kanu He said the Southeast had tried separating from Nigeria before which resulted in a civil war, hence should the region decide to take the same route, the Nigerian government will have no choice but to respond. According to him, the government will fight them and give them what they want. Reacting, Kanu in a tweet wrote: “Whenever Fulani Janjaweed threaten us with war, I laugh because Fulani never fought any war with us. Nnamdi Kanu orders total shut down of Abuja, Lagos, North, Southeast May 30 “The only tribe Fulani can threaten in Nigeria is the Hausa because they conquered them through Jihad. “The Biafran War was between Biafra and Britain(USSR, Egypt, etc) not Fulani.” Any army sent to Biafraland will die there – Nnamdi Kanu replies Buhari
