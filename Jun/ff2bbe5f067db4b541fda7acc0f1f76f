Honourable Chinedu Emeka Martins representing Ahiazu/Ezinihitte/Mbaise Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, on Wednesday, lamented the heavy casualties occasioning attacks in Imo State. He regretted that the unfortunate crisis could not be nipped in the bud before it got out of hand, particularly, so that when genuine citizens tried to intervene with a view to restoring peace, some forces were hell bent to make political capital out of it, thereby compounding the ongoing crisis. Reacting to the endless crisis going on in Imo State where an ex-aide to the former President Goodluck Jonathan on Political Matters, Ahmed Ali Gulak was assassinated last Saturday among other cases of wanton destruction of government and private properties by some criminal elements, the lawmaker in a statement which he signed and made available to DAILY POST in Abuja, called for restraint on side of government forces and the warring gunmen. Buhari, APC have failed Nigerians – PDP chieftain, Emeka Kalu He said Imo State is in a dilemma now that it needs to be rescued as the economy of the state was already collapsing for lack of peace and tranquility. “It must be expressly stated that the killings from both angles must be stopped forthwith; this is moreso, since our dear State must be rescued and recovered to its original state of peace and tranquility. “It is also deserving to remind our ebullient youths that they are the bona fide citizens of the State on whose shoulders the leadership will rest on in years to come, consequent upon which any violence that is targeted at individuals, State or private formations is not only condemnable, but a disservice to them and generations yet unborn.” The lawmaker appealed to well meaning individuals and clergies to speak out in condemnation of wanton killing that is going on in Imo State.
