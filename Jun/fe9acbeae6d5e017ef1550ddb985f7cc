Many of the aggrieved Igbos, particularly the Biafra secession agitators, have customized their T-shirts with the inscription ‘The Dot Nation’ in anticipation of Biafra. Reacting, Igbokwe described the senate Minority Leader as an “elder for nothing.” The Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Drainage and Water Resources, stated this on his Facebook page. He wrote: “A Senator and an ethnic bigot, an elder for nothing. “The blood of those policemen and the uninformed youths killed in the South-East will be accounted for in the fullness of time, We cannot be mad all the time.” South East insecurity: Don’t destroy Igboland – UN Mayor tells youths
