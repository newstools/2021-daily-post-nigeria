Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has reacted to England’s Euro 2020 1-0 victory against Croatia on Sunday. Ferdinand also singled out England star, Declan Rice, for his role in the Three Lions’ win over Croatia at Wembley Stadium. Gareth Southgate’s men defeated Croatia, thanks to Manchester City Raheem Sterling’s second-half goal. “It is about taking your moments like we did but also managing the game through difficult spells,’ Ferdinand told BBC Sport. “There were times when they were on the front foot, but then they took their foot off their pedal. “I was very impressed with the patience of this team from back to front. I thought Declan Rice in front of the back four was superb in his positions, cutting outcrosses, getting in great positions to cut the lines into the strikers. “There will be stiffer tests, but they did what they had to do today.” England’s next game is against Scotland on Friday.
