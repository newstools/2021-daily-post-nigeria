Ronald Koeman will continue as Barcelona manager in the 2021/2022 season, but he will have to play a 4-3-3 formation, according to SER Catalunya. The Dutchman’s position has remained in doubt, following a miserable end to the season. Barca finished seven points behind champions Atletico Madrid in LaLiga and was dumped out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage by PSG. However, Koeman will continue until his contract runs out in June 2022, after the Spanish giants failed to find a replacement. Real Madrid choose primary transfer target from Kane, Haaland, Mbappe Laporta has been in discussions with Koeman over his future in recent days, during which he made it clear that the manager must return to a 4-3-3 formation next season. Koeman favours a back three and used the tactical system in the run-in as Barcelona fell away in the title race. However, the 4-3-3 formation will be “non-negotiable” for Koeman, with Laporta desperately looking to restore the glory days and wanting Barcelona to play more offensive football again.
