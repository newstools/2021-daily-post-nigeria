A 45-year-old man has been arrested and arraigned in court for defiling his 15-year-old daughter and infecting her with HIV. It was gathered that the father who stays with his daughter at Muthara village in Tigania East, Meru County of Kenya, reportedly took her to the farm where he defiled her on several occasions. The victim fled home but was later found and taken to Muthara Police station. Upon her release, the girl refused to accompany her father home, telling officers that her father had repeatedly defiled her and her teachers, who she told about it, have refused to do anything about it. The investigating officer took the man’s clinic card and discovered that he had enrolled to collect anti-retroviral drugs. After conducting a test, both the father and his daughter tested positive for HIV. The convict admitted to defiling his daughter to ‘ease her sexual urge’, adding that he committed the offense because he did not want to die alone and leave the girl to suffer. Principal Magistrate of Tigania court Paul Wechuli said he was convinced that the 45-year old man had committed incest and knowingly infected the minor with HIV Mr Wechuli held that the man had betrayed his daughter’s trust and so deserved to serve the maximum sentence. He was, however, given 14 days to appeal. HIV self-testing, breaking stigma, discrimination barriers in Nigeria
