Chief Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for the 2020 Governorship Election in Edo State, has urged Governor Godwin Obaseki to intervene in the issue of the 14 lawmakers-elect who last year were suspended and removed from office. Ize-Iyamu said this in an open letter to Obaseki while congratulating him on his victory at the Supreme Court on Monday. He appealed to the Governor to consider an out-of-court settlement of the issue in the overall interest of the state. Ize-Iyamu said, “Though the matter is in court, you’re in a vantage position to consider an out-of-court settlement of the issue, in the overall interest of our state. “I also urge the Governor to intervene in the issue of elected Local Government Chairmen, Vice-chairmen, Councilors and Supervisory Councillors, who were sometimes suspended and removed from office. “Our appeal is that you consider paying them their entitlements since it is now late for them to return to their offices. This can also be through an out of court settlement. “Last Friday’s judgement of the Supreme Court puts an end to the series of litigations we had over last year’s governorship elections. “We’re happy that all these cases have come to an end. Now that it’s all over, please accept my congratulations.” FCTA demolishes Fulani settlement in Abuja
