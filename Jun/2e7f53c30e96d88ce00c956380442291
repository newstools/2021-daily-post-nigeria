Former Super Eagles head coach, Sunday Oliseh, has said he wants to revive his managerial career in Belgium, because of his family. Oliseh last managed a team three years, when he was in charge of Fortuna Sittard in the Dutch second-tier. He led them to promotion to the Eredivisie in the 2017/2018 season, but did not finish the campaign with the team. Oliseh was suspended by Fortuna Sittard on February 14, 2018.
