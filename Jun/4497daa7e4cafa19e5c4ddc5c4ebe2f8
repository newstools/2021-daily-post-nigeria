The statement titled: ‘How Fulani Repel, Send Suspected Bandits Out of Iwoland’ reads: “Bororo men with their cattle encroached Iwo. The Seriki Fulani with his men stormed the forest to chase the Bororo whose attitude is to eat crops at night and attack farmers. “It could be recalled that I invited the Fulanis to my palace, gave them orientation and charged them to identify the bad eggs among them. “Since that time the leadership of the Fulanis, Seriki, has been keeping up to the responsibility of ensuring culprits are identified, arrested and prosecuted. “In Iwoland, Fulanis are our security, not our enemies. The three local governments of Iwoland comprising Iwo, Ayedire and Ola Oluwa, enjoy a peaceful coexistence with Fulanis.” The Southwest has been under the attack by armed herders believed to be of the Fulani extraction.
