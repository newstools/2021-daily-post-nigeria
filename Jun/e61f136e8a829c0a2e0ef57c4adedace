The Progressive Youth Network, PYN, has enjoined the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige to congratulate the winner of the just concluded All Progressives Congress, APC, primary election in Anambra State, Dr. Andy Uba or remain silent. Ekene Chukwuma, the Publicity Secretary of the group in a statement to newsmen, noted that it was a grave concern to the group of alleged anti-party activities of the minister since the emergence of Dr. Uba as the party’s flagbearer. According to the group, the members were at a loss as to why Ngige is calling for the cancellation of an election in which he was not even a contestant.

The statement explained that the sustained campaign by Dr. Chris Ngige to torpedo the candidacy of Dr. Andy Uba would be resisted by the youths of Anambra State, stressing that they viewed with grave concern his machination to thwart a primary election in which he was not even a contestant. They advised him to desist from fishing in troubled waters. The group noted that as far as they were concerned, Ngige is a just rabble-rouser who had no real political influence in Anambra State. The statement recalled that with all the noise Ngige was making now moving from pillar to post, he (Ngige) could only deliver 33,298 votes for President Buhari in 2019 as against 524,738 votes scored by the PDP Presidential Candidate. The group said Ngige would want to pull down the roof simply because he cannot withstand the influence of Andy Uba in Anambra State. They appealed to INEC and the APC National Working Committee to disregard Ngige’s tantrums and focus more on strategizing on how to takeover Anambra State from APGA.
