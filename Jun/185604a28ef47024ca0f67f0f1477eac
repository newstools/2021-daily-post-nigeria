The Osun State Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode, has advised parents and guidance to warn their wards against any unnecessary protest. This is as the command beefed up security to ensure that 2021 Democracy Day is celebrated peacefully without any hitch. The police boss appealed to the people of the state to cooperate and collaborate with the security personnel detailed on the special assignment and other vehicles on patrol duties put in place to curb any act of crime and criminality. Olokode assured that his officers and other sister security agents will guarantee safety of lives and properties in all parts of the State during this period and beyond. Assuring the people of the state of adequate visibility policing and constant vehicular patrols, the CP urged the members of the public to conduct and comport themselves within the ambit of the law and jettison all forms of rumours of insecurity being peddled. “The police in synergy with other security agents are ready and capable to deal decisively with any act of criminality that might arise. “The Command will not tolerate any act of lawlessness. More so, citizens are enjoined to be vigilant and promptly report any suspicious movement or infraction of the law to the Police for immediate action through these numbers: 08039537995 & 08123823981,” the CP said.
