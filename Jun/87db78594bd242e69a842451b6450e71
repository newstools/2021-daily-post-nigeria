The Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to hand the Southeast Biafra as a means of ending the current unrest in the region and other parts of the country. The group made the remark in a statement by its spokesman, Abdul-Azeez Sulaiman, while reacting to the recent ‘civil war’ threat by President Buhari. DAILY POST reports that the president has been under verbal attacks over his comment threatening to clamp down on some elements in the Southeast for allegedly attacking security operatives and destroying government facilities in the region. Following the outrage by some Nigerians, who took to their social media handles to tackle the president over his ‘disturbing’ comment, Twitter on Wednesday deleted the controversial tweet. Arewa groups lambast FG over comment on coup While most Nigerians were pleased with the deletion, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed slammed Twitter over the move, alleging that the management has double standards. Reacting, CNG noted that the only option to restore peace in the nation is to ensure that the age-long agitation becomes reality. “It is time for the Nigerian state and all stakeholders to wake to the reality that the only remaining option to avoid a civil war is for the Igbo to be allowed to have the Biafra they have used intermittently for decades to destabilize the nation and deny peace to other components of the country,” Sulaiman said in the statement.
