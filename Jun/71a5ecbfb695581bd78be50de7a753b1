The Federal High Court, Abuja, on Tuesday, ordered that the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, be remanded to a Department of State Service (DSS) facility, pending the determination of his trial. Justice Binta Nyako gave the order after counsel to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Shuaibu Labaran, told the court that the defendant (Kanu), who jumped bail, had been arrested and produced in court. Labaran urged the court for an order detaining the arrested IPOB leader at the DSS facility pending the hearing and determination of the matter. Justice Nyako, who granted the plea, adjourned the matter until July 26 for trial continuation. DAILY POST had earlier reported that the DSS on Tuesday produced Kanu before Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja. Kanu was arrested by a combined team of Nigerian and foreign security agents in a coordinated interception. The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, on Tuesday, at an emergency media briefing in his office, confirmed the arrest of Kanu.
