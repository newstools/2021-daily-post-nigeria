Yoruba freedom fighter, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly know as Igboho, has said elections would not hold across the Southwest in 2023. Igboho said elections would not hold because Yorubas will break out of Nigeria. He spoke in a video anchored by his spokesman, Oluyomi Koiki. Speaking in Yoruba, Igboho said: “Marriage is not by force. We can’t live with you again. The Yoruba nation is a vehicle of salvation and I want all Yoruba to board the vehicle and have their seats. He also vowed that there is no going back on the agitation struggle. “How can we go back when we are almost at our destination? Those who have not joined us should do so now because there’s no election come 2023. Yoruba will go,” he said. Lately, Igboho has been agitating for Oduduwa Republic following the attacks on the Southwest by armed herders. Oduduwa Republic: Nothing can stop Yoruba from breaking out of Nigeria – Pastor Giwa
