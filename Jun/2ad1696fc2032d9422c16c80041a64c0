 BBNaija reunion on Thursday night ended with a lot of drama with two female housemates, Kaisha and Lucy engaging in a physical fight. It all started after Kaisha revealed that Ka3na disrespected her mother during a party they all attended. According to Kaisha, her mother at a party liked Ka3na and wanted a picture with her but she asked her mother to come to her table.

Kaisha disapproved Ka3na’s attitude, describing it as disrespectful to her mother. However, Ka3na in defence said she thought it was Kaisha’s manager that wanted a picture with her not her mother. Lucy backed Ka3na on this and kept talking about the situation despite Kaisha’s demand that they stop talking about her mother on the show. This angered Kaisha who then threw a pillow at Lucy, leading to a physical fight. Although some scenes were cut out, viewers could see Lucy walking out without her wig and shoes on.
