Nnamdi Kanu of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has vowed never to allow the Fulani to conquer Biafra land. The IPOB leader reiterated that it was for this purpose the Eastern Security Network, ESN was created. The ESN has recently been accused of carrying out attacks on Government assets and killing security agents in the South East and South-South regions. But Nnamdi Kanu and his group have constantly denied having hands in the atrocities, insisting that their target is the killer herdsmen terrorising the states across the country. “IPOB remains the only constant obstacle on the path of the Fulani conquest of the rest of Nigeria,” Kanu tweeted. “Now, the duty of Safeguarding Biafraland remains our sole focus & responsibility. This Is why ESN was created to put an end to the unchecked atrocities against innocent Biafrans.” Herdsmen attacks: Buhari part of Fulani agenda to conquer Nigeria – Tiv youths allege
