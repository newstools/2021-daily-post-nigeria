Barcelona midfielder, Miralem Pjanic, wants a return to Juventus this summer transfer window. Pjanic has been linked to a transfer to Chelsea this summer. The Bosnian international joined Barcelona last summer from Juventus in a move that saw Brazilian midfielder Arthur Melo move the other way. The 31-year-old has since endured a torrid ten-month period, having struggled to establish himself in the plans of Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, in the recently-concluded 2020/2021 campaign. But according to Sport, Pjanic has the preference to return to Juventus, where he would link up with the new manager, Massimiliano Allegri, at Allianz despite the interest from Chelsea. Pjanic made just 30 appearances for Barcelona in his debut season, with only 13 of those coming from the start. The player failed to contribute with a single goal or assist and has fallen behind the likes of Frenkie de Jong, Sergio Busquets, Pedri, Riqui Puig and Ilaix Moriba in Koeman’s pecking order of midfielders at Barcelona. When asked about his future at Barcelona in March, Pjanic said: “I did not sign for Barca to leave the following year. “I signed to make history at a club that had been on my path for many years.” Barcelona offer Miralem Pjanic in exchange deal for Chelsea star
