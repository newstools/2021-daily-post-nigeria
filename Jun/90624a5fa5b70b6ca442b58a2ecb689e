Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, will sign a new contract with the club soon. Football transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, confirmed this, saying Messi will sign a new two-year contract with Barcelona that will see him remain at Camp Nou until 2023. According to him, Barcelona president, Joan Laporta, is optimistic the Argentine captain will sign a new contract, adding that the player’s agent has met with the LaLiga giants. Messi’s current contract with Barcelona will expire June 30, with a final decision yet to be made over his future. Romano, who disclosed this on The Here We Go Podcast, said: “Barcelona has always been confident. I have said many times on the podcast, President Laporta has always been convinced that Leo is going to sign the new contract, so it is just a matter of days. “[On Thursday], the agent of Leo Messi, his brother and his father, they will both be in Barcelona together with Leo for his birthday. They will be negotiating about the last things to be completed. It is a complicated contract with many clauses and many details to be fixed, so they are working on these details with Barcelona. “From what I am told, the announcement is not scheduled yet, so we need to wait to see when it will be announced. It will be a two-year contract with Leo Messi.” LaLiga: Iniesta explains what will happen to Barcelona if Messi leaves
