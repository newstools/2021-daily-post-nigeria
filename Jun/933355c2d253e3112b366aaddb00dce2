Gareth Southgate has been promised a new contract until 2024 no matter how England perform at the ongoing Euros or next World Cup. Football Association chief executive, Mark Bullingham, has made it clear they want Southgate to continue beyond his current deal which expires after the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Bullingham said: “We would love him to carry on, for sure, beyond this contract. “Gareth knows exactly how we feel about him. He knows that we think he’s doing a great job and we’d like him to carry on.” Southgate would have been in charge of the Three Lions for six-and-a-half years by the end of Qatar. Although he has admitted he would love to go back to club football, the FA will fight off any approaches.
