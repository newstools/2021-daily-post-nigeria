AS Monaco midfielder, Cesc Fabregas, has reacted to Spain’s Euro 2020 goalless draw against Sweden on Monday. Spain got their campaign off to a disappointing start after failing to find the breakthrough despite a dominant display against Sweden in Seville. Strikers, Alvaro Morata and Gerard Moreno, missed Spain’s best chances as they played a 0-0 draw against Sweden.

We had enough chances to win the game. “But the big question mark is how we end up defending and how we end up attacking. Today we were just not at it.” Spain’s next game is against Poland on Saturday. Messi deserves a happy ending – Fabregas
