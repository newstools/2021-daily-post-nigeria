The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested Kess Theophilus and Sunday Eshiebor Isaiah for alleged conspiracy, impersonation and cryptocurrency-related fraud. Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC spokesman in a statement said the duo were apprehended after a petition by one Nalim Sharma. Sharma met the suspects through a LinkedIn account, Sophia Gomez and was lured into a phony bitcoin business. From January 2021 until June, she allegedly invested a sum of $12,000 in ‘cryptocurrency’. The suspects, who claimed to be bitcoin experts, used a platform Life Trade Option. Uwujaren noted that the complainant sensed fraud when the suspects suddenly severed communication. Theophilus and Isaiah will be charged to court at the end of investigations.
