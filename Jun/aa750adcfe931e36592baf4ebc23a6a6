At about 5 am, the suspects arrived at the scene with an Hiab truck with which they lifted the generator, unknown to them that they were being monitored. “As soon as they lifted the generator into the truck, the policemen swooped on them and apprehended three of the suspects,” Abimbola Oyeyemi, Ogun police spokesman confirmed to DAILY POST on Monday. During interrogation, Oyeyemi said the police discovered that “the site engineer, Clement Idenyi, was the mastermind of the crime.” “Further investigation revealed that Tunde Adewale had already been contacted, and had agreed to buy the generator from them if they succeeded in stealing it, he also provided them with logistics to make the stealing easier, hence he was equally apprehended,” Oyeyemi stated. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, while commending his men, ordered a thorough investigation of the case with the view of arraigning the suspects.
