Controversial Nigerian cross dresser, Idris Okunneye, popularly known as Bobrisky, has attacked former BBNaija, housemate, Ka3na for boasting about having sex with Praise while in the house. In a post on Instagram, Bobrisky said the self acclaimed ‘Boss Lady’ was classless for hurling insults at Praise. Recall that Ka3na, who boasted that she used Praise, revealed that she had sex with him because he claimed he can never have anything to do with her. The mother of one also mocked Praise for poor performance in bed. “Nobody does that to me. Don’t speak low of me. Remember what happened? I called you to my bed and had sex with you. “He didn’t last for five seconds. After all the rubbish you said, you didn’t even last 5 seconds,” she said. But reacting, Bobrisky said the reunion was trash because the housemates acted immature. He wrote, “How can you be a Boss lady by bringing Praise to have sex with you for free on a live tv show and still have the guts to open your mouth and say he is a five seconds man? Only if Praise knows your well don too deep. Rubbish. “I’m personally coming for you because you are classless. Remove the boss lady shit from you Bio, it’s the audacity for me. “This BBNaija reunion is trash. How can mature boys and girls’ mouths be leaking? You see why I said ladies must never run anything with a boy? Because he will kiss and tell.” I want my life back – Bobrisky cries out after plastic surgery
