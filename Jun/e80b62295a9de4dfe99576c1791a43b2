Former England striker, Michael Owen, has handed manager, Gareth Southgate, a list of players he should field in the Three Lions’ upcoming Euro 2020 last 16 fixture against Germany. England will face Germany in the round of 16 fixture on Tuesday evening at Wembley Stadium. Southgate’s side head to the game after beating Cezch Republic 1-0 in their final Group tie on Tuesday, while Germany played a 2-2 draw with Hungary on Wednesday to qualify. According to Owen, Southgate should play Bukayo Saka, as well as captain Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling, who has scored both of England’s goals so far at the tournament.

Stick with the system we have played throughout the tournament so far or revert to a back 3, which many shrewd judges believe will be better suited to the way Germany plays.” “I would go 4-2-3-1,” he added before selecting his starting XI that comprises Kane, Grealish, Sterling, Foden, Rice, Henderson/Phillips, Shaw, Maguire, Stones, Walker and Pickford.
