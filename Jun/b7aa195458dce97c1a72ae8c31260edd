Security personnel and State Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC) ad-hoc staff have secured their freedom after the announcement of local government election results in Jigawa State. DAILY POST reported that voters held hostage security personnel and election officials at Kiyako ward in Birnin-Kudu Local Government Area of Jigawa State over an alleged attempt to change the outcome of the results. The SIEC officials were locked in a classroom for over 12 hours over the disappearance of the ward returning officer to announce the results of the Ward. Announcing the results on behalf of the returning officer in Kiyako ward, Birnin Kudu local Government Electoral officer Balabare Umar said Yunusa Abdul of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) scored 3,952 votes while his opponent of the All Progresive Congress (APC) scored 690 votes. “Therefore the candidate of the PDP having scored the highest votes he therefore emerged winner and was duly elected as councilor in Kiyako ward,” he said. Shortly after the announcement of the results, the victims were set free. A resident told DAILY POST that the ward is a stronghold of the PDP and the ward of former Governor Alh Sule Lamido. “We would rather die than to allow these people to steal our mandate,” he stated. However, jubilations rocked the area after the official announcement of the results. Confusion as Ogun, Lagos Local Govt polls clash with APC Ward Congresses
