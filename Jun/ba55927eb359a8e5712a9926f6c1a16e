Former Cameroon and Inter Milan striker, Samuel Eto’o, has admitted he was hurt by Jose Mourinho’s decision to join AS Roma. Mourinho was sacked by Tottenham Hotspur on April 19. The 58-year-old will however not be out of job for a long time, as he has agreed to take over the Italian club. However, his move to Inter’s rivals, has hurt Eto’o, with both men working together at the San Siro in the past. “It hurt me, I am not going to lie, to see the one who gave me the chance to win titles in Italy to go to another [Italian] club,” Eto’o told AS . “But I know that he is happy and our friendship is above everything. I would have liked to see Mourinho at Inter again. But I will always wish him luck at Roma. But he has to understand that no matter how much I love him, for me Inter will always come before.”
