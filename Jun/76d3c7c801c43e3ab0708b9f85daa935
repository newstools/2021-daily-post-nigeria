The National President of the Nigeria Union Journalists, Chief Chris Isiguzo, has advised the Federal Government to rise to the challenges which insecurity poses to “our national integrity”. Isiguzo gave the advice in his address at the opening ceremony of the 2021 NUJ National Conference taking place in Port, the Rivers state capital. The NUJ President said the government whose primary responsibility is to protect lives and property appears to have been overwhelmed by the security challenges in the country.
