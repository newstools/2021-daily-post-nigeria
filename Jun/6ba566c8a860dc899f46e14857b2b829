Eriksen collapsed on the pitch before the closing stages of the first half of Denmark’s Euro 2020 game against Finland on Saturday. The 28-year-old playmaker was resuscitated on the pitch, with players and fans watching on in distress before he was taken to hospital.

Speaking on the development, Mourinho, who was Eriksen’s manager at Tottenham Hotspur for two months, said it is a day to celebrate after the positive news about the player’s condition. “Today I cannot stop thinking about what happened yesterday,” Mourinho told talkSPORT. “I think it’s a day to celebrate, not to be sad. “Hopefully, football went in a direction where the organisation, the protocols, the level of the doctors and the specialists, and I also believe God was looking at football at that moment. “Everything together made Christian to be with us, to be with his family, to be alive. “It was much more important than football but at the same time, I believe that it also showed the good values of football. “The love, the solidarity, family spirit. It was not just about his family, it was about the football family. Football brings people together. “I prayed yesterday, I cried yesterday, but how many millions did it around the world? I believe many because football can bring people together. “Yesterday, for the wrong reasons, football brought people together. At the end, we can celebrate that Christian is alive. “Of course, I didn’t speak with him, but I spoke with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg [Eriksen’s teammate] this morning and Pierre is very positive about Christian. “The news is good, so I think it’s a moment to celebrate.” Christian Eriksen breaks silence after cardiac arrest at Euro 2021
