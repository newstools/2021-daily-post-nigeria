Local hunters in Osun State have urged the state government to maximize the potency of the local security outfit known as ‘Ogoje Ilu’ as a complementary form of security approach for contingent reasons in the state. Also, they have called on the state government to synergize with them more on the use of orthodox policing system to complement the security system. This call was made by the head of the local hunters in Ijesa land, Chief Ogunbiyi Akamo, during the Governor’s Family Meeting organised by the Office of the Special Adviser on Civic Engagement in Ilesa.

He expressed hope that the relationship between the two security outfits would reinforce a bottom-up approach to the security network and bridge the disconnect between the local community and the centre in the policing system. The head hunter charged the Adegboyega Oyetola administration to strive more in order to come up with a robust arrangement for internal security that will make a difference and reflect community participation through the use of local security outfits. The hybridised security framework he hinted will be more driven by local intelligence systems due to their domiciliation among the people. In his response, the Special Adviser on Civic Engagement, Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, who represented the governor assured the hunters that their aspirations and demands would be given adequate consideration. He also explained that the meeting was meant to be a forum where the people’s interests and opinions could be represented in the state policy circle which would also serve as a vehicle for strengthening democratic ideals through participatory and inclusive governance.
