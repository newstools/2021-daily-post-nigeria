Former Deputy National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olabode George, has said that the silence of President Muhammadu Buhari on the killing of over 40 people by suspected Fulani herdsmen in Igangan, Ibarapa Local Government Area of Oyo State was suspicious. George said that it was disappointing that Buhari’s aide, who always react swiftly to incidents such as this, have remained silent. According to the PDP chieftain, it was dangerous that Buhari, being a Fulani man, has refused to speak. George spoke in Lagos on Wednesday, in his State of the Nation’s address, pointing out that Buhari being a Fulani man was enough for him to come out and condemn the dastardly act. “President Muhammadu Buhari’s silence on the killings of people of Igangan community is dangerous and the fact that he is a Fulani man makes the matter worse. Group describes shoot-at-sight order as massacre against Igbos “I know his media aids to be very fast in reacting to issues but their silence on this particular incident is very suspicious,” he said. This was just as he pointed out that the killings by the Fulani herdsmen “in the wee hours of last Sunday has brought the seething malady right to our doorsteps. No one is safe anymore. “The senseless killings, the cruel inhuman massacre of the Igangan natives in the Yoruba heartland by suspected herdsmen in the wee hours of last Sunday has brought the seething malady right to our doorsteps. No one is safe anymore. “I wonder, what hate, what evil, what madness will propel anyone of sane mind to plunge into the night with weapons of war, seeking out fellow citizens for pillage and murder? It puzzles rationality. It benumbs the senses. “The Igangan massacre is now a watershed in these ceaseless psychopathic killings that now pester our country without let. It will continue to haunt us all.”
