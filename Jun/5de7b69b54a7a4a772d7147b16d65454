Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has tackled proponents of the Yoruba and Biafra nations, saying it is “almost idiotic” to push for Nigeria’s disintegration at a period that Africa gears towards political, social and economic reintegration.” Obasanjo, spoke Wednesday at the luncheon and investiture of Kehinde Isijola as the new Ogun State Chairman of the Nigerian Institution of Surveyor (NIS), held at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta. The former Nigerian leader conceded that the situation remains unpalatable in Nigeria; he, however, said disintegration of the country is never the solution. Obasanjo opined that Nigerians should blame themselves for the worst of the country instead of blaming God. The Balogun Owu said everybody in Nigeria is apprehensive over the state of the nation, saying anyone who is not apprehensive is a human being without being human.

Obasanjo posited that citizens of Biafra and Yoruba nations will be diminished compared being citizens of Nigeria, stressing that “our strength is in our diversity,” “In this age and time that we are talking about the reintegration of Africa for economic development, disintegration of any country will be almost idiotic,” he added.
