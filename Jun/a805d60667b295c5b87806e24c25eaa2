The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has accused the Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of allegedly making moves to “procure” the forthcoming Supreme Court judgment in his favour. The party which lost at the Appeal Court to Akeredolu in the October 10, 2020 governorship election in the state alleged that the governor was using the monthly allocation of the state to curry favour from authorities of the Supreme Court ahead of the judgment. PDP in a statement signed by its South-West Publicity Secretary, Chief Sanya Atofarati, urged labour unions in the state to be on the watch out. “It has come to our notice that the Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu Odunayo has been negotiating the forthcoming Supreme Court judgement with the State allocations just for favouritism.” The party disclosed that there was a similar ploy by the governor to frustrate the Appeal Court judgement. “Even after the judgement, the appeal court reluctantly refused to release the certified true copies of the judgement to our party.” Reacting to the development, the governor who spoke through his Commissioner for Information, Donald Ojogo described the claim of PDP as baseless, stressing that PDP was on the rough path to depression. “The PDP is, therefore, admonished to focus on its appeal at the Supreme Court and pursue same with the desired legal industry and zeal rather than this voyage of self-denial and blackmail,” he said.
