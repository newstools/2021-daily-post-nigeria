The Delta State Police Command has claimed one Louis Okandeji who defiled a young child is still in prison following his alleged release from custody. The CP Ari Muhammad Ali in a statement signed by the Acting Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe said the suspect’s victim is four years and not three years as widely reported by the media. He also clarified that the suspect is thirty-four and not thirty-nine years as earlier reported. CP Ali said, “Louis Okandeji ‘m’ 34yrs was arrested for the offence of defilement on 1st June 2021, after the mother of the victim reported at ‘A’ Division Warri that her Daughter who is 4yrs old was allegedly defiled on the 1st of May 2021 by the said suspect.” He said, “At no time did the Police release the alleged suspect as he is still in custody. The case is currently under investigation.” CP Ali urged members of the public to ignore any report contrary to the fact stated above, as such a post is only aimed at discrediting the image of the Command by some disgruntled elements who are only bent on sabotaging the effort of the Delta State Police Command. DAILY POST had reported that the Delta State Secretary-General of the Committee for the Defence of Human Right, CDHR, Comrade Israel Joe told our reporter that the Divisional Police Officer, DPO of “A” Division in Warri allegedly released the suspect.
