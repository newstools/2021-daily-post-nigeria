The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) on Wednesday staged a protest at the National Assembly against the nomination of an aide of President Muhammadu Buhari, Lauretta Onochie, as a Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Recall that shortly after President Muhammadu Buhari nominated Onochie as an INEC Commissioner, Senate President Ahmad Lawan asked the Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)  nominees as INEC commissioners. The nomination was received with heavy criticisms as some Nigerians said a partisan individual like Onochie should not be an electoral umpire. However, on Wednesday, the National Chairman of PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, who led the protest said Onochie is a manipulator and will pollute INEC. Also in attendance was the Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe and other PDP lawmakers.  Secondus said, ”We are here to make a final point of total rejection of Lauretta Onochie. She is partisan, we don’t need INEC to be polluted. ”If she is cleared she will be representing one party, APC and that can cause a lot of problems for our country. ”We urge the NASS to reject her. It is important that the country must know that in a crisis situation like this what we need from Mr President is free and fair elections. ”This woman is APC and is a card carrying member. She will pollute the atmosphere at INEC and will rig elections. ”We don’t want the Anambra election and that of 2023 to be rigged. She is a specialist in manipulation.” Also speaking, Abaribe, who calmed the protesters, assured that justice will be done. ”I have come here with all my colleagues from the PDP in the Senate and as the minority leader this letter will be presented to the Senate President immediately. ”I can reassure you that justice will be done,” he said.
