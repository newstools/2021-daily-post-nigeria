Apostle Johnson Suleman of the Omega Fire Ministries, has spoken on the death of Prophet T.B Joshua. T.B Joshua of the Synagogue, Church Of All Nations, SCOAN, died a week ago 24 hours after he finished a church programme. Apostle Suleman, who is one of the few frontline pastors who are yet to react to the death, said it came to him as a rude shock. According to him, people saying all sorts of things about the man of God even after his death are devilish and evil people. “A man of God just passed on and people are saying all sorts of things and even abusing him at his death. How devilish, evil, wicked people are” he told his congregants during one of his church meetings. “He was not fine for two days and he was still ministering to people. Now those people are going to move on with their lives. “I haven’t said anything about the death of the man of God because I’m still in shock. And I have now discovered that you can’t cheat nature”.
