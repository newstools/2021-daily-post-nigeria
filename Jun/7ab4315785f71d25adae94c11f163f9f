The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has thrown aside a suit challenging the legality of the three-month tenure extension of Inspector General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu by President Muhammadu Buhari. Abuja-based legal practitioner, Maxwell Okpara, filed the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/106/20. The presiding Judge, Justice Ahmed Mohammed in his ruling, held that the President is vested with the constitutional powers to appoint an IGP, in consultation with the Police Council. He said the President also has the powers to extend the tenure pending the appointment of a substantial IGP to prevent the existence of a vacuum. According to Mohammed, that plaintiff failed woefully to prove that Buhari has no power to extend the tenure of the former IGP, Adamu for three months. “The suit of the Plaintiff failed and it is accordingly dismissed,” the court held. Lawyer to the Plaintiff, Ugochukwu Ezikiel told reporters after the ruling that the judgment of the trial court will be tested at the Court of Appeal. Others named as defendants in the suit include Adamu, Abubakar Malami, (SAN), and the Nigeria Police Council.
