Former Adamawa Commissioner for Information, Ahmad Sajoh has opposed calls for the break up of Nigeria, stressing that God joined the people. Sajoh accused some citizens of perpetrating treason with their violent style of struggle. He advised those calling for secession to channel their energy to making Nigeria a better country. Sajoh said separation is not the solution and urged the citizens to join hands to fix the current challenges. “We must appreciate God’s purpose in putting us together. Nigeria is better together,” he told NAN. Sajoh observed the belief in certain quarters that the only way to assume power is agitation. According to him, it worked for the South West in 1999, the South South in 2011, and the North in 2015. “There has been this pattern and it’s nothing new. However, what is happening today is a culmination of our slide towards anarchy. “The agitations are not just forceful but somehow treasonable in some cases. “Non-state actors having a hold of instruments of violence openly, it’s becoming a worrisome phenomena,” Sajoh said.
