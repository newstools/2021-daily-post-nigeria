Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), on Wednesday accused security agents of secretly abducting and killing Igbo youths in the Southeast. Kanu alleged that security agents justify the abduction and killing of these youths by tagging them unknown gunmen. Speaking through IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful, Kanu alleged that security agents abduct their victims from their houses. A statement by Powerful reads: “The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ably led by our indomitable leader ,Mazi Nnamdi Kanu wishes to place the world on notice, of the ongoing abductions and secret killings of Biafrans especially Igbo youths by the Nigeria security agents, and tagging them unknown gunmen. “These compromised and Fulani-controlled security operatives move from house to house and abduct Igbo youths, whisk them away to their slaughter houses and later dump their corpses at mortuaries as unknown gunmen.” Nigerian military bombing, secretly killing Igbos – Nnamdi Kanu alleges Kanu claimed that the secret abduction and killing of Igbo youths is a move by the Federal Government to depopulate the region. “This is a secret genocide orchastrated by the Fulani-controlled Federal Government to depopulate Ndigbo before the coming of Biafra. “Despite the daily slaughter of security agents mainly of Southern origin in the North by bandits and terrorists, the Nigeria military or police has never embarked on mass arrest and secret killing of youths and residents of the crime scene. It’s unfortunate that the treacherous political class has kept mute over this atrocity. But IPOB cannot keep quiet. “The intention of the masterminds of this crime against humanity is to weaken the South East, and pave the way for its long-planned invasion by jihadists. But they will not succeed,” he added. Security agents plotting to attack Southeast starting with Anambra – IPOB
