Borussia Dortmund striker, Erling Haaland, has agreed personal terms with Chelsea to move to Stamford Bridge in this summer’s transfer window. This claim was made by respected football expert, Ian McGarry. Erling Haaland’s preferred move revealed Speaking on The Transfer Window Podcast, McGarry said: “Personal terms for Haaland are signed off. “It’s just a case of Chelsea agreeing a fee with Dortmund.” Haaland had drawn the interest of Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City and other top European clubs in the past few weeks. The 20-year-old will reportedly be available for £68.9million next summer due to a release clause in his contract. The Norway international finished the 2020/2021 season as the highest goal scorer in the Champions League with 10 goals.
