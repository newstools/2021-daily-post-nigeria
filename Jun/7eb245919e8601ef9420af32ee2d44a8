The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kebbi State has removed its caretaker Chairman, Bala Sani Kangiwa. Kangiwa is accused of misappropriating funds earmarked for the inauguration of party executives in wards and local government areas. The state chapter has since presented the acting Chairman, Abubakar Kana, to Governor Atiku Bagudu. The officials explained that stakeholders agreed to replace Kangiwa after investigation of the allegations against him. The caretaker Assistant Secretary, Zayyanu Aliero, narrated what led to the suspension of Kangiwa; the Treasurer, Garba Musa; and Financial Secretary, Aliyu Bature. Aliero confirmed that former Public Relations Officer, Sani Dododo, willingly tendered his resignation. “Based on legal advice and in consonance with the APC constitution, 51 out of the 57 executive members at the state and local government levels approved the suspension of the caretaker chairman, treasurer and financial secretary as a disciplinary measure,” he said.
