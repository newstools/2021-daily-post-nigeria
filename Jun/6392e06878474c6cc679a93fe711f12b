Real Madrid goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, has claimed that Eden Hazard will “100 per cent” remain at the club next season. Hazard has failed to impress in his first two seasons in Spain, following his €100million move from Chelsea. The Belgium captain has been linked to Paris Saint-Germain and a return to Chelsea in recent weeks. But amid speculation Madrid could look to move him this summer, Hazard’s team-mate for club and country has insisted he will remain at the Bernabeu.
