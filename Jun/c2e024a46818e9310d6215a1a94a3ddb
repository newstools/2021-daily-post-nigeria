Nigerian Singer, Seyi Shay has decried being pressured by her fans to get married and have kids. The 35-year-old singer, speaking in a recent interview with HipTV, revealed her fans also pressure her to release more raunchy photos on social media. Recall Seyi Shay months ago set the Internet on fire with a nude picture of herself on a bed. The singer said, “I feel pressure from my fans to get married, have babies, have a boyfriend; that is all before the pressure to release a new single sometimes which is really crazy. “I also get pressure to show some more butt pictures.” She, however, said the pressure is good and part of what motivates her. “The pressure is high from fans but it is good. It is part of what keeps me gingered as well. I don’t burn myself out and I do not overdo things,” Seyi Shay added. Tiwa Savage, Seyi Shay fight dirty inside Lagos salon [VIDEO]
