Inter Milan right wing-back, Achraf Hakimi, has ruled out any possibility of leaving the club for Chelsea this summer. According to the Express, Hakimi would instead prefer to seal a move to Paris Saint-Germain ahead of Chelsea this summer. The 22-year-old is keen to work with PSG manager, Mauricio Pochettino, in turn snubbing a move to Chelsea. Hakimi had drawn the interest of Chelsea in the past few days. He scored seven goals and registered eight assists for Inter Milan last season. The Morocco international joined Inter Milan from Real Madrid last year. Inter Milan are expected to demand around Â£66million in order to sell Hakimi. EPL: Tuchel ready to sell Hudson-Odoi
