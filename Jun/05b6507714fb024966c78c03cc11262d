The Oyo State Government has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of playing politics with the death of Rahmon Azeez. Taiwo Adisa, Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde lambasted the opposition on Thursday. Azeez, 36, was killed last week in the violence that erupted in Iwo Road. The deceased just got a visa to travel to the United States to see his wife and newborn twins. Azzez had arranged for his spouse to travel to America where she put to bed. Adisa, during a programme on Agidigbo FM, Oyo Updates, said rather than seeking to gain undue attention, politicians should allow the law to take its course. The CPS stated that the attempt to use unfortunate incidents like Rahmon’s demise to launch political ambitions is ungodly and evil. “When an issue like this happens, what one should do is to allow the law takes its course. The opposition politicians are supposed to support the law or operators of the law to make sure justice is served. “They can even support the family with a lawyer but not to attempt to take political advantage of such gruesome incident, and be making meaningless political statements. “Some of them have gone as far as saying that the late Rahmon was an astute APC member but there is no evidence to show that the deceased or his mother belong to the APC. “This matter is not even about partisanship; it is about getting justice for the deceased and Governor Makinde has made that commitment”, Adisa said.
