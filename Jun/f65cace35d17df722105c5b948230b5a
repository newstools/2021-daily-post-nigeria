Obateru said the corporation identified at least six refinery projects it intends to seek equity participation, “five of them are at the development stage with the Dangote Refinery being the largest of them”.

Ologbondiyan noted that the transaction must be made open, in terms of conditions for crude barter trade, duration, equity sharing, signatories among others, The spokesman urged the National Assembly to take advantage of its oversight power on the NNPC to ensure that the deal followed due process. “The PDP insists that any process involving diversification of our nation’s economic interest by the government must be made open, transparent and not be used as a conduit pipe for misappropriation”, he said.
