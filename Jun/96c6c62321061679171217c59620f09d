She said, “ I and Praise became very close, he gave me a massage. I told him that I was drawn to him because I felt we were in the same circle. “I am separated from my husband, you have a fiancée and we don’t need much from each other. “He had a conversation with Lucy and Dorathy that he is in the house for the game. Praise said he knows I like him but he can never have anything to do with me. “Nobody does that to me. Don’t speak low of me. Remember what happened? I called you to my bed and had sex with you. “He didn’t last for five seconds. After all the rubbish you said, you didn’t even last 5 seconds. “He also came to my hotel room again, maybe to redeem himself.
