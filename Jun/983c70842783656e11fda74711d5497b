The Ondo State House of Assembly has congratulated Governor Rotimi Akeredolu on his victory at the Court of Appeal. This was contained in a statement signed by Olugbenga Omole, the Chairman, House Committee on Information, Youth and Sports Development, on Thursday in Akure, the state capital. The Speaker, Bamidele Oleyelogun, on behalf of 26 lawmakers, said the victory was well deserved. He said, ”The people of the state unanimously renewed the mandate freely given to Governor Akeredolu during his first tenure in the 2020 polls. ”The governor’s achievement cuts across every sector of the state including infrastructure development, education, health, industrial revolution among others. “We as members of the state assembly pledge to continue to work with the Governor towards making his dream to redeem Ondo State a reality.” DAILY POST had earlier reported that the Court of Appeal sitting in Akure on Wednesday discharged the appeal filed by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last gubernatorial election in the state, Mr Eyitayo Jegede, against Akeredolu, who was the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the election. The appellate court said, in a unanimous judgment, that the petition by the PDP and its candidate lacked merit. In concluding her lead judgement, Justice Theresa Orji-Abadua disclosed that the appeal was partially discharged and allowed.
