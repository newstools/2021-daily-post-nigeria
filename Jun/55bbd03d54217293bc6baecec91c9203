UEFA has postponed the game between Denmark and Finland at a ongoing European Championship. The decision was taken after Danish midfielder, Christian Eriksen, collapsed on the pitch. “The UEFA EURO 2020 match in Copenhagen has been suspended due to a medical emergency,” a terse statement read. An update then read: “Following the request made by players of both teams, UEFA has agreed to restart the match between Denmark and Finland tonight at 8.30pm CET.” It also confirmed tonight’s match between Belgium and Russia will still go ahead. Eriksen, meanwhile, has been confirmed to be in stable condition in hospital. The playmaker collapsed as a throw-in was taken towards him towards the end of the first half at the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen, with medical staff being called onto the pitch immediately to apply CPR.
