The Adamawa State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has asked that steps be taken to avoid the killing of another northerner in the Southeast as such a repeat killing could spiral against Southeastern people in the North. The party articulated its position to newsmen in Yola against the backdrop of the killing in the Southeast of an Adamawa indigene and member of the party, Barr Ahmed Gulak. Chairman of the APC in Adamawa State, Ibrahim Bill, said the killing of Gulak was premeditated by those who had repeatedly targeted northerners in their region. He insisted that Gulak’s killing was not political as Governor Hope Uzodinma inputted but the handiwork of IPOB, “judging from the video from the scene which shows some persons cheering and waving IPOB banner.” Gunmen murder Jonathan’s ex-adviser Ahmed Gulak in Imo “We, therefore, call on President, Muhammadu Buhari the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, to use the full might of the Federal Government to rein in the activities of IPOB and bring the killers of Gulak to book,” Advising security agencies to decisively address the threat posed by IPOB to the security and unity of the country, the APC stressed the importance of bringing Gulak’s killers to justice. They claimed nobody can predict what may result from the killing of Northerners in the South-East after now. He asked stakeholders in the Southeast to seize the initiative by not giving up their space and voices to IPOB. “We do not buy the idea that all stakeholders from South East have yielded their space and voice following the compliance by many in the region to the sit at home order issued by IPOB,” Bilal said, urging those who realize the danger that IPOB poses to the country, including people of the Southeast, to be courageous enough to speak up.
