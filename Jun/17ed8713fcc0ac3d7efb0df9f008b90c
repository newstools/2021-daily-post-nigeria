Lionel Messi will end speculation about his future with Barcelona, by signing a stunning 10-year contract, the UK Mirror reports. Messi will see his current deal expire on June 30, 2021, one year after he tried to force his way out of the Nou Camp. With his contract expiring, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain have been linked with a move for the Argentine captain. But following the signing of his close friend and compatriot Sergio Aguero, Messi is ready to put pen-to-paper on a long-term deal. Messi ‘offered 10-year Barcelona contract’ for half salary The 33-year-old will be given a contract until 2031 in order to afford his staggering salary. Barca’s current financial situation means spreading Messi’s wages over a longer period of time could make a deal more viable in the short-term. Messi will earn around £206million over the next four years, with the first two of those seeing him remain on the playing staff at Barca. From 2023, it is then proposed he would join David Beckham’s MLS franchise, Inter Miami, where he will play for a further two seasons before hanging up his boots in 2025. After that point, it is suggested Messi will take on a position behind the scenes, with a job as a Strategic Partner and Ambassador of the club. Messi informs Barcelona of his future plan
