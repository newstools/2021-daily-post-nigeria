The family of Prophet Samuel Kayode Abiara says speculations about his death are completely false. Abiara is the General Evangelist, Worldwide of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC). Pastor Isaac Abiara of the CAC Agbala Itura Worldwide issued a rebuttal in reaction to circulating news. “Prophet (Dr) S. K. Abiara, Planter of Christ Apostolic Church Agbala Itura is healthy and alive”, the statement read. The church expressed appreciation for the love and concern shown to the family from people across the world. Abiara implored the public to disregard the rumour “and keep praying for Papa to do more than he is doing for the propagation of the gospel”. Two popular clerics in Nigeria died in recent weeks. General Superintendent of Redemption Ministries Worldwide, Rev. Stephen Akinola passed away early June. Akinola gave up the ghost hours after the death of Prophet T. B. Joshua, founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN).
