The Police in Lagos State have heightened raids on identified black spots across the state. The Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu gave the order at a meeting with Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers and Tactical Heads on Monday. He vowed to flush criminals out of their hideouts and instructed senior officers to take charge of the operations. Odumosu said the strategy is to be proactive on security matters rather than being reactive. The Police boss directed that the raids be repeated and urged operatives to constantly monitor human conducts within their respective areas of responsibility. Odumosu charged the Area Commanders and Divisional Police Officers to enforce the order of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, against tint permits, siren and SPY number plates. The CP reiterated that existing tint permits remain valid; only new vehicles with factory fitted tints are exempted. Vehicles with other forms of tints are to be impounded while the owners will be charged to court accordingly. Unauthorised users of siren and SPY plates will be arrested and their vehicles seized ahead of prosecution. Odumosu further warned that approved SPY plates must be fixed on registered trucks/pick ups, not on private SUVs or cars.
