A Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha jet conducted airstrikes around Genu town in Niger State at the weekend. The aerial bombardments eliminated many bandits fleeing in a convoy. Herds of rustled cows were also killed. The fighter aircraft was scrambled from a military base in Katsina State. One of the bombs allegedly strayed towards a wedding party in an adjoining community. An eyewitness said they saw a jet dropping bombs on bandits and one hit a wedding event in Argida village. “Two villagers were killed unfortunately. We gathered that several others who were guests at the wedding feast, sustain injuries. ” NAF Director of Information, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet told PRNigeria that the airstrikes at the axis were very successful. “We have no information on any civilian casualty. Our mission is against armed bandits in that Genu axis, after we got intelligence on bad elements planning to terrorise the people”, he said.
