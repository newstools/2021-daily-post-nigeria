He maintained that most of the teenage girls were found in the company of different men who had deceived and brainwashed them with fake marriage proposals. Attributing the rise in such cases to poverty, illiteracy and negligence, Ibn Sina said the board would arrest and prosecute anyone found guilty of trafficking underaged children, involved in child molestation and drug abuse among others. The Commander General reiterated the agency’s commitment to eradicating all forms of child labour and molestation, domestic violence, drug abuse among others.
