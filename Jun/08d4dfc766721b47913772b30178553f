The pain na die and some of you girls are going two times. Haa make una fear God. Bobrisky reveals why he underwent plastic surgery
“Who send me message. Yansh is already three weeks plus and is still strong. “All my back is still paining me. I hope my own lipo is going through same process like yours because I’m not understanding (sic)”. Bobrisky said he nearly died after the anesthesia wore out, disclosing that the anesthesia is injected inside the spinal cord to ease pain. “The moment the anesthesia worn out from my body after the surgery I nearly died. The whole hospital no sleep, even pain killer no reach me. I don commot my hand for anything called lipo. I never wan die now. I want my life back – Bobrisky cries out after plastic surgery
“See listen if you do lipo you will be off social media for like one month because you have to take care of yourself to avoid infection and all. “Do you know where they will inject the anesthesia? Inside your spinal cord. My spinal cord still hurts so bad till now. Nobody should hurry me to post please. I need to be okay first,” his post read.
