Nigerian singer, David Adeleke, popularly known as “Davido” has reacted to a prophecy claiming that he will be poisoned by someone very close to him. A yet-to-be identified Nigerian pastor in a viral video revealed that he has seen a vision that the popular hip hop singer will be poisoned and consequently rushed to hospital. The cleric also claimed in his message that someone residing with the popular musician was plotting to harm him. According to him, the person will put the poison in Davido’s drink. He further disclosed that he has prayed to God on behalf of Davido so that the vision could be averted but unfortunately the vision will come to pass. The cleric, however, said the poison will not kill Davido but that it is capable of making him unconscious until he loses a part of his body and becomes handicapped. “I told you about one singer called Davido,They will poison him. I don’t know him and I haven’t seen him in my life. “He will be rushed to hospital and will be admitted. “I’ve been dealing with it in prayer but the lord said it will happen. And the person that will poison him is sleeping in his house,” the acclaimed prophet said. Reacting, the singer in a post via his Twitter account declared that no weapon fashioned against him will prosper. He also noted that he is blessed and God will expose and deal with any wickedness around him. “God will expose and deal with any wickedness around me near or far;AMEN . I’m blessed,” he wrote. Meanwhile, this is the second time such prophecy is coming up about the singer. A Ghanaian pastor had earlier revealed that the singer would face an attack from his enemies and may not survive it.
