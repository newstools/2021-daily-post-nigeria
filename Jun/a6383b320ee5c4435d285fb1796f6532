BBNaija star, Prince has reacted to Brighto’s comments on his financial capability to have a relationship with Nengi. Brighto had on Tuesday night, during the BBNaija Reunion show, said Prince is not financially capable to have a relationship with Nengi. This did not go down well with Prince who said he does not need to prove his financial capabilities to anyone. According to him, “I don’t show people look at your pocket and think it’s like theirs and think you’re financially incapable like them. “I don’t bother myself with questions about other people’s pocket or financial status.I don’t bother myself with trying to tell you how much I make or how much im worth “The poorer you think I am benefits me because that means I don’t have to prove anything and you’ll think I’m just as financially incapable as you are and you wouldn’t have to come to me for help.” BBNaija Reunion: Prince not financially capable to date Nengi – Brighto
