The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, has raised an alarm over the activities of scammers taking advantage of the recent employment screening exercise to demand payments from shortlisted candidates for narcotic officers and narcotic assistants. NDLEA alleged that these scammers are demanding payment from shortlisted candidates before they are employed. The Director of NDLEA’s Media Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, urged Nigerians to be wary of these scammers and blackmailers. Babafemi, while disclosing that an investigation was ongoing, said candidates should report those behind the racketeering for prosecution. Babafemi also disclosed that NDLEA is currently not recruiting. A statement by Babafemi, some phone numbers and bank accounts are currently being probed by the agency. The statement reads: “The Agency had on 12th May and 6th June, 2021 notified the public and job seekers to be wary of messages from persons claiming to be acting on behalf of NDLEA and/or its officials demanding payments for employment. “While the NDLEA is currently investigating at least three telephone/bank account numbers linked to members of the job scam syndicate, intelligence gathered by the Agency shows that some criminal elements at the receiving end of the ongoing offensive action by the NDLEA are in the process of using the activities of the job scam syndicate as an instrument of blackmail against the Agency and/or its officials using pliable online platforms. “For the umpteenth time, we reiterate that the Agency is not recruiting into any cadre of its workforce. We have just recently concluded the screening exercise for those whose employment process started in 2019. “Any pretence by professional scammers to extort money from anyone especially those who recently participated in the screening exercise should be ignored and their details reported through our social media handles direct messages.” NDLEA arrests 10 alleged drug traffickers in Abuja
