Unknown gunmen have continued to unleash attacks on communities in Benue State despite efforts by stakeholders from the Taraba South to mend fences with their Tiv and Fulani neighbours The latest of such attacks which took place in the earlier hours of Wednesday occurred in Jauro Gantang village of Gassol council. The incident as gathered by DAILY POST led to the killings of a man and two of his children. A resident of the attacked community who spoke with our correspondent on the telephone said the attackers stormed the village at about 1am on Wednesday. “The attackers killed a man and his two sons. A woman who sustained a gunshot wound in the attack is receiving treatment at the First Referral Hospital in Mutum Biyu, the administrative headquarters of the council,” he said. The attack is coming few days after a directive issued by the state governor to all internally displaced persons to return to their homes. Though the Police Public Relation Officer, David Misal, denied knowledge of the attack, the Public Relations Officer of Nigerian Immigration Service in the state, Ayuba Tijos confirmed it. The Police through its spokesperson had claimed it received no report of the attack from the community. The Immigration PRO, Tijos said the incident took place in Jauro Gantang Lomudo under Sarkin Dutse District in Mutum Biyu Chiefdom of Gassol Local Government Area. He confirmed that a man was killed by unknown gunmen alongside his two children while his wife sustained a gunshot injury in the night attack. As at the time of filing this report, fear has again enveloped community members, some of who have already concluded plans to flee for fear of another attack.
