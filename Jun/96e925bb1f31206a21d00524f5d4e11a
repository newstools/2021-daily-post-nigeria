The Minister of Labour, Chris Ngige has said President Muhammadu Buhari has accepted the adoption of dialogue to address agitations in the South-East. Ngige revealed this on Sunday, while speaking with State House correspondents, after meeting with Buhari in Abuja. There have been agitations from parts of the South-east for secession, with the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) well in the forefront of the fight. However, Ngige claims the federal government is working out some modalities to ensure that the people of the region do not “feel unwanted” in Nigeria. Biafra agitation: Shehu Sani hails Ngige over support for united Nigeria “We also looked at the security situation, especially in my zone, the south-east, and we made some proposals to him based on the yearnings of the people, and what the government also wants. “We are following up with dialogue, which at the end of the day, is what will happen. We have to talk; we have to discuss. Part of the discussion starts tomorrow. The minister of defence, minister of interior, and service chiefs were in Enugu last Saturday and we’re going to do follow-up meetings on that. “We briefed him and he accepted that dialogue is the way to go in all this,” Ngige said.
