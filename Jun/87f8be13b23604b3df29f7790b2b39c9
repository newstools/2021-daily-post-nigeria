Bashir El-Rufai, one of the sons of the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to block the self-acclaimed leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in cell with a cow. The governor’s son stated this in a tweet on his Twitter handle while mocking the fugitive over his arrest on Tuesday. Recall that after over two years of man-hunting, the Federal Government on Tuesday, disclosed that it has rearrested the self-acclaimed Biafran leader. The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, who confirmed the development, said he was arrested by a combined team of Nigerian and foreign security agents in a coordinated interception. Reacting, Bashir El-Rufai described those upset over the arrest as cowards stating that the development was a victory for Nigeria. “There are those that will be upset this hooligan was arrested but will be too cowardly to express it. Victory for the country. “May we all continue to progress in unison. He should be locked in a cell with a cow, please, President Buhari.” Reactions trail arrest of IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu
