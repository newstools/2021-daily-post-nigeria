The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has accused the Taraba State Government of not properly funding the National Blood Transfusion Service Centre in the state. The group, which made the observation when they joined the rest of the world to mark World Blood Donor Day 2021, said the state government was not doing enough to fund the centre for better performance. Led by its state chairman. Dr. Edet Nkanta, the poor funding, according to them, has led to dwindling infrastructure, equipment and service production in the centre. NMA debunks reports linking member to banditry in Zamfara Citing other parts of the country where the centres have been functioning well, the reverse, according to them, has been the case in Taraba State. He added that “here in Taraba State, we have a lot of issues, the state government is not taking adequate care of this place.” More to that, they unanimously agreed that “It is a worrisome development because, if the state government cannot fund the blood donation centre that is expected to save lives of thousands of her citizens, then what exactly are we doing? On his part, the acting State Coordinator, National Blood Transfusion Service, Dr. Yohanna Samaila, also expressed dismay that the centre has been confronting different forms of challenges. He added that the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has as well aggravated their challenges and the need for individuals to voluntarily come out and donate blood to save the lives of people, he said has become necessary.
