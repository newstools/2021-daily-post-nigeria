Nigerian troops have apprehended Wida Kachalla, a boy that ran errands for Modu Sulum, a late commander of the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP). Sulum, who took charge of the sect’s logistics, was recently killed by a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) strike. Sulum played a role in the elimination of Boko Haram factional leader, Abubakar Shekau. He supervised the destruction of power transmission towers in Borno highways as well as attacks on travellers. His young ally was arrested by troops from FOB Ngamdi, led by acting Commander 154 Taskforce Battalion, Major DY Chiwar, The soldiers, assisted by local vigilantes, traced Wida to Benisheikh Market. Wida Kachalla is a native of Murguba settlement in Borno, an ISWAP-Boko Haram enclave. At the point of arrest, he chewed SIM cards, but his two phones were recovered. A military source told PRNigeria that communication and couriers of terrorists have been intercepted at various routes in recent weeks. “While the suspect chewed and swallowed his sim cards, we already had the major data for intelligence gathering”, the officer said. Items seized from Wida included a bag of flour, cartons of biscuits, crates of evaporated milk, crates of soft drinks, cartons of anti-grass chemicals, among others.
