The Lagos State Police Command has assured residents of adequate security of lives and property on Saturday June 12. There are fears that Lagos will be shut down for the June 12 Democracy Day Celebration. Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, said that commercial and social activities will go on as normal. A statement he signed noted that the command is not aware of any planned protest nor curfew. The spokesman warned those might want to foment troubles to steer clear.
