The House of Representatives has confirmed Major Gen Farouk Yahaya as the Chief of Army Staff. The committee of the whole, on Tuesday, considered the report of the committee on defense which screened the nominee. Babajimi Benson, the Chairman of the committee, presented the report for consideration. Major General Yahaya was nominated by President Buhari to replace the late Chief of Army Staff, Ibrahim Attahiru, who died on the 21st of April, alongside 10 others. Benson said the nominee was able to address some of the issues raised at the screening. He said: “Mr Chairman, the COAS came to the committee, and he was grilled on local content, funding of the military, the relationship with civil authorities, and he gave apt answers to the questions raised. He battle-tested.” When the question was put to vote, it was voted unanimously.
