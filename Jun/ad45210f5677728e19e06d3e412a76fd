Roma manager, Jose Mourinho, has named Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish as the player England need to start against Czech Republic when both teams clash in tonight’s Euro 2020 final Group D tie at Wembley Stadium. Mourinho believes England manager, Gareth Southgate, must start Grealish against Czech Republic because the midfielder plays like Portugal legend, Luis Figo. Grealish is yet to start for England at the Euro 2020 so far. England head to the game following a 0-0 draw against Scotland, while Czech Republic played a 1-1 draw with Croatia.

“England look like a shy team, so they need Jack Grealish against the Czech Republic tonight,” Mourinho told the UK Sun. “He looks like he has always been on that stage. “The guy is brave. The guy never played a European match for his club, but he arrives in the national team and is fearless. “He risks. He gambles. He loses the ball. He creates. He kicks people. People kick him. He creates instability in opponents. “And he wins free-kicks. “You win free-kicks in wide areas, then you go with Harry Maguire or Tyrone Mings or John Stones and Harry Kane — and England are powerful on set-pieces. Europa League semi-final fixtures confirmed“England looked a shy team against Scotland because they were a team without that thing that Grealish has. “I don’t like comparing players — and Luis Figo was at a different level — but Grealish is like Figo in that he’ll demand the ball. “He says, ‘Give me the ball and I will resolve this!” “Grealish didn’t play amazingly when he came on against Scotland, but how many times did he have the ball? How many fouls did they commit on him? How many one-against-ones did he create? England needs these qualities.”
