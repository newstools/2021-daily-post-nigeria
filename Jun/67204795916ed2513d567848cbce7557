UEFA have announced that a new handball rule will be used at the Euro 2020, Mirror UK reports. The new rule has been designed to not penalise attackers if they accidentally commit a handball in the build-up to a goal. The rule was introduced by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) back in March and will start to be used around the world next month. There was an opportunity to bring the new law in sooner if UEFA wanted to.
