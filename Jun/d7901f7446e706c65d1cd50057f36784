After over two years of man-hunting, the federal government has at last rearrested self-acclaimed Biafran leader, Nnamdi Kanu. He was arrested by a combined team of Nigerian and foreign security agents in a coordinated interception. The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, on Tuesday, at an emergency media briefing in his office confirmed the arrest of Kanu. Kanu who was put on trial on charges bothering on terrorism, treasonable felony and sponsoring unlawful organization had escaped from Nigeria shortly after his arraignment before the federal high court in Abuja and admission on bail. Justice Binta Nyako who granted him bail on the ground of his ill-health had revoked the bail on march 28 , 2019 and issued a bench warrant for his arrest in any part of Nigeria. He, however, confirmed that Kanu will appear before the federal high court today, for continuation of his trial.
