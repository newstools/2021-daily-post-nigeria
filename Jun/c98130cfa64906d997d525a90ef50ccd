Lanre Gentry, estranged husband to Mercy Aigbe has reacted to a Father’ Djay post by the actress on her Instagram page. Mercy Aigbe had in her post wished herself a happy Father’s Day, revealing she plays the dual role in the lives of her kids while throwing a shade at Lanre Gentry. Her post read, “Happy Father’s Day to me and all the responsible fathers out there! 2 Kids ( 1 international student) changing naira to dollars with this dollar rate! Please it’s not easy but God has been gracious. “Please no one should come and tell me how I shouldn’t take the shine off Fathers oh! (Fatherhood is beyond just impregnating a woman, if you are a man and you do not perform your responsibilities towards your kids, Biko you ain’t fit to be called a Father and that’s period! So, Since I am playing the dual role in my children’s lives, allow me celebrate myself everyday! Because it’s not easy! This got a reaction from Gentry who took to his Instagram page denying that he’s a ‘deadbeat’ father. According to him, he is a father and has been responsible to his kids. He wrote, “If you like take your children to the moon, it’s nobody’s business. If you like, pay in dollar or yen , it’s nobody’s palava. I have helped you pay for the school fees of another man’s daughter before, so. “Some women over there will say happy fathers day to themselves when they are not good to be a mother or housewife to their children. You can’t blame them, they have no good background and dont have their parents together, that is why they don’t know what Father’s Day is. “I am a father to all my children. I pray for all fathers in Jesus name.”
