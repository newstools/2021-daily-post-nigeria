Micro blogging platform, Twitter, has finally shut down in Nigeria. DAILY POST reported on Friday that the Nigerian Government announced the suspension of Twitter from operating in Nigeria. The suspension was indefinite as the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed explained that Nigerians were using Twitter to perpetuate activities inimical to the corporate existence of Nigeria. This happened a few days after Nigerians pleaded with the Chief Executive Officer, CEO, of Twitter, Jack Dorsey to suspend the account of President Muhammadu Buhari. The call was as a result of Buhari’s tweet on Tuesday whereas the Nigerian President stated that his government will get “harder” on those trying to destroy his government. Buhari’s tweet: Adamu Garba asks FG to block Twitter from Nigerian internet space Buhari had vowed that those wanting to destroy his government will receive the shock of their lives, a threat directed against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its military wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN). Buhari’s Twitter account was being reported by Nigerians who believe the last part of the thread of his tweet is a threat to IPOB and ESN. Consequently, Twitter deleted the offensive tweet. This, however, angered the Nigerian government. The nation’s information minister, Lai Mohammad had described Twitter’s action as double standard. However, the government on Friday announced the ban of the social media platform. Following the announcement, activities continued on the platform for a few hours before it was finally shut down. DAILY POST observes that new tweets no longer pop up as the platform does not refresh anymore. Twitter ban in Nigeria: Buhari’s aides still tweet despite suspension by FG
