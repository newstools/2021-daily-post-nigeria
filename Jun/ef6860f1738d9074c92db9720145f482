Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, has disclosed that more chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC) soon. Fani-Kayode disclosed this while lamenting over the wave of defections from the PDP. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, the PDP chieftain pointed out that the party must do some soul-searching. He wrote: “In the last few months PDP has lost 3 Governors and a handful of Senators and House Members. I can confirm that more surprises are coming soon. “This should lead to a lot of soul-searching and introspection on the part of the PDP and not insults and threats of litigation.” The former minister urged the opposition party to reach out to aggrieved members. Lately, the PDP has lost three governors to the APC. Over the weekend, the Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle dumped PDP for APC. Also, the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi and his Cross River State counterpart, Prof. Ben Ayade, defected to the APC.
