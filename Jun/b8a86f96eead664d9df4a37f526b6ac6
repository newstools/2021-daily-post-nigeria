Terrorists operating in Borno State have finally freed a number of people held in captivity for months. They include a staff of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Abubakar Garba Idris (a.k.a. Alooma). Alooma, a Senior Protection Assistant with the UNHCR, was abducted along Damaturu-Maiduguri highway on January 2, 2021. Others released were security personnel, a pastor, a businessman, civil servants and other civilians. Like Alooma, the rest were seized during attacks on towns and Internally Displaced Persons camps along Damaturu-Maiduguri road. It is still unclear which of the sects carried out the abduction. Boko Haram and breakaway faction Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) have terrorized the North-East for over a decade. An intelligence source told PRNigeria that freed hostages are undergoing medical checks by the military in Maiduguri and would be released to their families within a short period.
