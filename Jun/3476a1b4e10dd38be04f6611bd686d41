The Federal Government says it has taken steps to disengage defaulters of all the SIP program which it initiated to alleviate poverty in the country. Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, disaster management and social development Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq disclosed this at the flag-off of the Social Investment Management Information System (SIMIS) and provision of engagement letters to trained independent monitors in Dutse the state capital of the state. The move to disengage some persons may not be unconnected with series of misconduct and abuse of office perpetrated by some beneficiaries and supervisors of the program across the country. President Muhammadu Buhari in 2016 introduced the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) aimed at lifting citizens out of poverty through a number of Social Interventions which include N-POWER, National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP), Conditional Cash Transfer Programme (CCT), and the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP). Representing the minister, an Assistant Director of the ministry on ICT, Aminu Tukur Bello said 5000 Independent Monitors were recruited and trained on an evidence-based report of findings in the field. Bello said tablets have been distributed to the Trained Independent Monitors to equip the ministry with information on happenings at their various local Governments. The Minister said the program reserves the right to disengage any Independent Monitor or beneficiary for misconduct or noncompliance with set guidelines and directives of the programs. “We at the Ministry will not accept anything short of the set standards, we will therefore not hesitate to disengage any Independent Monitor or beneficiary for misconduct” “Under the National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme, we can see where feeding has not taken place or under N-POWER where some beneficiaries abscond from their duty” she stated. The minister urged independent monitors to carry out the assignment with the utmost sense of patriotism, diligence, and sincerity.
