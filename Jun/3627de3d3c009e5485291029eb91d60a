Serena Williams has been sent packing from this year’s French Open by Elena Rybakina. Rybakina won the three-time champion in straight sets 6-3 7-5 on Sunday. This means Williams’ quest for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam singles title continues. The American superstar was one of just three top-10 players left in the women’s draw but has now been denied a first quarter-final since 2015. The 21-year-old Rybakina’s victory guarantees a new Grand Slam finalist from the bottom half of the draw. Rybakina will now play Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who advanced to the French Open quarter-finals for the first time in a decade after coming from behind to defeat 15th seed Victoria Azarenka.
