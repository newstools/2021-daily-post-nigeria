Wenger said that Xhaka was exceptional for Switzerland, adding that the Arsenal midfielder rallied his teammates before the penalties. Switzerland defeated France 5-4 on penalties after Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe saw his spot-kick saved. The match ended in a 3-3 draw after 120 minutes at the National Arena in Bucharest, Romania. Speaking after the game, Wenger told BeIN Sports: “He [Granit Xhaka] was exceptional, all his choices were good. “He was the one who rallied the troops before the penalties.”
