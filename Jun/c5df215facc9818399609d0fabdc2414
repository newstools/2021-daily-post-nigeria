The Independent National Electoral Commission,INEC, has declared Alhaji Usman Baba of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, winner of the bye-election for Sabon Gari Constituency in the Kaduna State House of Assembly. Recall that the seat initially occupied by Aminu Shagali, a former Speaker of the assembly, was declared vacant in April, after he was accused of absconding from activities of the assembly for more than 360 days. Following the development, INEC had announced June 19 as the date for the by-election to fill the vacant seat. However, the Returning Officer, Dr Mohammed-Nuruddin Musa, on Saturday while announcing the winner of the election in Zaria, said Baba won the election with 9,113 votes. NAN reports that Musa said Baba defeated his closest contender, Malam Musa Musa of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who got 7, 404 votes. He further revealed that Malam Anas Abdullahi of the ADC had 62 votes; Chindo Ibrahim of ADP, 61 votes while Musa Halilu of PRP secured 305 votes.
