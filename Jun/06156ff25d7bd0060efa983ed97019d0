France midfielder, Paul Pogba reportedly clashed with his teammates during their Euro 2020 round of 16 tie against Switzerland on Monday night. The Manchester United star was at the centre of tension between France players during their Euro 2020 5-4 penalties defeat to Switzerland. Pogba’s gleaming long-range strike had put France 3-1 ahead. But two late goals from Switzerland forced the game to extra time and then penalties, while PSG’s Kylian Mbappe missed the decisive spot-kick to send France out of the European championship. According to L’Equipe, Pogba was involved in an ‘altercation’ with Adrien Rabiot during the match. Pogba was also criticized by right-back Benjamin Pavard for his lack of defensive work as France attempted to close out the game. The report added that there was tension between Pogba and France coach, Didier Deschamps, with the Les Bleus boss keen for his team to see the game out with a 3-1 lead.
