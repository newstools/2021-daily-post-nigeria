Borussia Dortmund striker, Erling Haaland, wants a move to Chelsea. Haaland had drawn the interest of Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City and several top European clubs in the past few weeks. But according to The Telegraph, Haaland is ‘interested in a switch to Chelsea and is ‘attracted by the prospect’ of joining Thomas Tuchel’s side. The report added that Chelsea is fully aware of the difficulty of signing Haaland this summer transfer window and are considering the option of securing an agreement that would see the youngster delay his Dortmund exit until next year. The cost to sign the 20-year-old this summer transfer is expected to be in excess of £150 million. The Norway international will reportedly be available for £68.9m next summer due to a release clause in his contract. Haaland finished the 2020/2021 season as the highest goal scorer in the Champions League with ten goals. Meanwhile, speaking about Haaland’s future at Dortmund, the club’s Sporting Director, Michael Zorc, ruled out the possibility of the forward leaving the Bundesliga giants this summer. “We are still planning with him,” Zorc told Sky Germany. “He will play with us in the new season.”
