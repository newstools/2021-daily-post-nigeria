At least, twenty travellers on their way to Enugu State have reportedly been kidnapped by suspected Fulani herdsmen. DAILY POST gathered that the kidnappers were operating along the Okigwe-Onuimo axis in Okigwe LGA of Imo State. One of the passengers who allegedly witnessed the incident said the herdsmen, disguised as police officers, intercepted the 18 seater bus they were travelling to Enugu in and ordered three passengers into a nearby bush. He said the herdsmen also commandeered a sienna bus fully loaded with passengers, including the driver.

Meanwhile, efforts to reach the Imo State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, proved abortive as his number was not reachable.
