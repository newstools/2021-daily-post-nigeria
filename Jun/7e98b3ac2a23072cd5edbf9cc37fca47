France midfielder, Paul Pogba, on Tuesday night removed a bottle of Heineken beer that had been placed in front of him at a Euro 2020 press conference following his side’s 1-0 victory over Germany. Pogba removed the bottle when he sat down to speak to the media after he was named ‘Man of the Match’ in France’s win against Germany. While the Manchester United star offered no explanation for removing the bottle, it is likely because his religion considers alcohol ‘haram’ or ‘forbidden’. Pogba also left a bottle of water and two bottles of Coke on the table untouched. The 28-year-old grew up with a Muslim mother and says many of his friends are Muslim, but he did not begin practising the religion himself until 2019. Meanwhile, Heineken, which is one of the official sponsors of Euro 2020, are yet to react to Pogba’s action. This is coming less than two days after Portugal captain, Cristiano Ronaldo, moved aside Coca-Cola bottles in a similar set-up. The Juventus star, while addressing the press ahead of Portugal’s Euro 2020 group-stage clash against Hungary, spotted the two bottles of carbonated drinks and immediately pushed them away from his vicinity. The former Real Madrid forward then picked out a bottle of water and said to the cameras: “Agua! (Water!)”.
