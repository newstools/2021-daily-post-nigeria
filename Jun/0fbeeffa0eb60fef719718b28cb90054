Although the 35-year-old refused to confirm his next destination, he emphatically ruled out the notion of him ever playing for Real’s great rivals Barcelona. “Since January I’ve been on the market, so there have been some calls, interested clubs. “But we never had in mind leaving Real Madrid. From now, we will look for a good option “Sevilla is the other club of my heart, had a marvellous time there. But today I am not thinking about that option. Barca would be a resounding no, impossible to see Ramos in a Barca shirt,” Ramos said. LaLiga: Messi made sure Real Madrid did not win more titles – Sergio Ramos
