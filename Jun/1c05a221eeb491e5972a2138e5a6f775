A husband, Christopher, beat his 39-year-old wife, Isoken, to death over N2,000 in Benin, the Edo capital. The incident occurred Saturday night at No.1, Agbontaen street, beside Ebvareke Secondary School in Uselu, NAN reports. The eldest child, Augustine Christopher, 13, said the father, a worker with a waste manager in Benin, usually beat his mother. He recalled that earlier in the day, Christopher, 45, called the deceased on phone and requested N2,000. The son said the father returned home at about 9 pm and attacked Isoken, accusing her of embarrassing him each time he requested for money. Augustine disclosed that after the assault, he tried to give the mother paracetamol and water but Christopher seized both and threw it away. “She went out to pour water on her body and later lay down outside. My father locked us inside the room and went outside to pounce on my mother where she was lying down. “That was when neighbours came and rushed her to two different hospitals, where she was both pronounced dead on arrival,” he narrated. The boy said that his father was a smoker and was always drunk. A neighbour, Mrs Florence Obahiagbon, corroborated Augustine’s recount. She said after Isoken died, residents invited vigilantes who apprehended Christopher as he attempted to escape. Edo Police Command spokesman, SP Bello Kontongs, confirmed the incident. He said investigation has commenced.
