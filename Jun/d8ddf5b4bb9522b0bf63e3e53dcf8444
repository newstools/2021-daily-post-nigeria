Sunday Dare, the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, has slammed Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, over his unfair treatment of players from the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) ahead of Nigeria’s international friendly tie with Mexico on July 4 in the United States. Since he took his role as the head coach of Super Eagles, Rohr has come under criticism for not inviting more NPFL players to the senior national team. The German tactician said last week that Nigeria couldn’t beat Mexico in the upcoming friendly using home-based players from NPFL. Augustine Eguavoen will be in charge of the team when they face the Mexicans in the friendly, a development which has annoyed Dare. Dare expressed his disappointment when he visited the home-based players at their Abuja camp ahead of the trip to the United States for the Mexico clash. He urged the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to have a talk with Rohr on his behaviour towards NPFL players, adding that the Super Eagles manager should shut up and do his work. “Rohr’s attitude towards home-based players is unacceptable, it’s negative to our football development and I call on the NFF to call him (Rohr) to order. “Rohr needs to shut up and do the work of his contract, he talks too much,” Dare was quoted by Soccernet as saying.
