Argentina captain, Lionel Messi, has admitted he is worried about contracting COVID-19. This comes as they kick off their Copa America tournament on Monday, amid an outbreak of infections among rival teams. Players and officials from Bolivia, Colombia and Venezuela have already tested positive for Coronavirus even before the tournament kicked off on Sunday in Brazil. Messi says the fear of contracting the virus was widespread in the squad. Copa America in doubt after CONMEBOL confirms Argentina will no longer host tournament “It worries us because it is a risk for everyone catching COVID-19,” he told reporters. “We try to be careful but it’s not easy. These things happen. “We’ll try to do all we can so no one gets it but sometimes it doesn’t depend solely on ourselves.” Messi has reportedly not been vaccinated, even though the South American Football Confederation confirmed it had received vaccinations in April and would administer it to players before the Copa America kicked off.
