Nigerian Idol judge, Sheyi Shay has opened up on her recent fight with Tiwa Savage in a Lagos salon. The popular singer explained the drama that ensued between herself and Tiwa on Tuesday. Seyi Shay told the Pulse that she’s still surprised at her colleague’s reaction and cannot believe Tiwa’s action stemmed from Kizz Daniel’s ‘Fvck you’ challenge song that went viral and which she (Shay) took part in. Sheyi Shay explained that she had greeted Tiwa when she (Shay) entered the salon and to which Tiwa responded warmly until the drama began 20 minutes later. “I walked into the salon, I saw Tiwa and I could feel the tension and I decided to get up because I could see people looking at her and looking at me and I won’t allow people to feed on what is not.

I was so confused and I just said okay and she kept shouting calling me a bitch and talking about the Fvck you challenge. “We had met before and even taken pictures and she didn’t for once act like that, so I don’t want to believe it was the Fvck you challenge.” As DAILY POST earlier reported, Tiwa had during the incident hurled obscenities at Sheyi Shay. She said she had not forgotten what Sheyi and Victoria Kimani had done to her in the past. Recall that two years ago, Sheyi Shay and Victoria released their covers of Kizz Daniel’s hit song, ‘F**k You’, where they had both dissed Tiwa. In her lyrics, Seyi Shay said, “You know I’m not Savage, I pay my bills.” Victoria Kimani, on her part, accused Tiwa of prostitution and blocking her from a show.
