The All Progressive Congress (APC) Chairman, Publicity Sub-Committee and Zamfara Commissioner for Information, Alhaji Ibrahim Dosara, on Monday said no fewer than 18 governors of the party are expected to receive Gov. Bello Matawalle of Zamfara on Tuesday. Dosara, who made this known during an interview with newsmen, said the Progressive governors will be led by the APC Chairman Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Gov. Mai Mala-Buni of Yobe State. “We are also expecting all our national assembly members as well as state legislators to declare their defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the APC during the occasion. “Similarly, all the 14 local government caretaker committee chairmen who just finished their tenure, council members and teeming supporters will join the hundreds of thousands of the Matawalle loyalists, friends and supporters in our movement to our new party, the APC,” he said. He further noted that the event, which is considered a historic one in the state, will further unite politicians and strengthen the APC in the state. DAILY POST reported Matawalle’s defection to the APC from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Personal Assistant to Nigeria’s President, Muhammadu Buhari on Digital and New Media, Bashir Ahmed disclosed this on his verified Facebook page on Sunday morning.
