Juliana Bitrus, Borno State Commissioner of Health has issued a query to the Provost, College of Nursing and Midwifery, Rukaiya Mustapha, for suspending some students who failed to welcome President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari paid an official visit to Maiduguri on June 17. Bitrus described the provostâ€™s action as mischievous and against Borno State Government. The commissioner lamented Mustapha acted without recourse to any official at her supervising ministry. The query with reference number MOH/PER/752 V.I is dated June 25, 2021. Bitrus demanded that the provost responds within 48 hours. The commissioner said while Borno has about eight state owned tertiary institutions, it was curious that only the students of one were punished. Bitus added that though it is a normal practice that students join in welcoming visiting Presidents, such acts are voluntary.
