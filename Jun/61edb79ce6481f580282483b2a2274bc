Juventus manager, Max Allegri, turned down Chelsea twice in the space of fifteen days, his mentor, Giovanni Galeone, has said. According to him, Allegri also ‘rejected a proposal’ from Manchester United before he decided to return to Juventus. Recall that Allegri returned to Juventus last month, two years after he was sacked by the Italian giants in May 2019. “Last year when he was at Juventus, Allegri said no to five big offers. Chelsea tried twice in the space of fifteen days and he always rejected every proposal,” Galeone told Il Bianconero. “Then Real Madrid contacted him more than once, while Arsenal, PSG and Manchester United also tried. This was all in the space of a year, but he always said no. “I do think that if Juve hadn’t called, he would be in Madrid now, even though he was not entirely convinced by the organisation there. Nobody is, really.” Allegri tells Juventus chief, Agnelli to sell Cristiano Ronaldo
