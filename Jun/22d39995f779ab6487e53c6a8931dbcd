Chelsea attacking midfielder, Kai Havertz, has named teammate, Antonio Rudiger, as the outstanding Blues player since their manager Thomas Tuchel’s arrival at Stamford Bridge last January. Rudiger looked to be on the verge of leaving Chelsea last January under former manager Frank Lampard. But after Lampard’s departure and Tuchel’s appointment, Rudiger’s form has been exceptional for the reigning Champions League winners. Champions League: Tuchel explains why he substituted Havertz, Werner against Porto “He [Rudiger] has given us so much stability over the last few months. After Tuchel’s arrival, he played outstandingly,” Havertz was quoted by Goal as telling reporters ahead of the Euro 2020. “As a mentality player, he is also important. On the pitch, he is a warrior. A bit like Kante – you want him in your team. “Playing against him in training is not as much fun either. The last few months have been top. It was very hard for him at first and now he is fighting his way out of it.” Chelsea: I’ll give my best – Kai Havertz makes fresh promise on new role
