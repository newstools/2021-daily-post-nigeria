The Rivers State Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka, has waded into the controversy between students and Management of the Rivers State College of a Sciences and Technology. This comes as students of the college were locked inside the school premises on Monday in what appeared to be a move to stop the them from continuing their protest against lack of basic amenities in the college. In a bid to prevent the breakdown of law and order, the commissioner of police invited the students for a meeting at the police headquarters in Port Harcourt. The management had on Saturday ordered all students of the college to go home after the students refused to listen to several appeals to sheath their sword. The students were, however, not happy about the directive of the school management whom they said did not consider the security implication of the order. While some students were able to make it home on Saturday, others who could not were left stranded outside the college gate at night but were later made to sign an undertaking not to embark on further protests before being allowed access into the college. The student, however, attempted to continue their protest on Monday before the invitation from the state police commissioner. Speaking at the protest ground, the Senate President of National Union of Rivers State Students, Lenebari Miracle assured that they will honor the police invitation but threatened to continue the protest if their demands are not addressed. He said “They sent an assistant commissioner of police down to this place because since this agitation started on Tuesday there is need for dialogue”. “The students have been looking forward to dialogue so today the commissioner of police has called us to his office and we are looking forward to a positive change after today”.
