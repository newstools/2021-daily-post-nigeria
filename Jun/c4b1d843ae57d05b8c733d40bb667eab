Two of the suspects were caught by the CRRUTECH security officials while one absconded. Following the tension generated by the death, the management of the university shut down the Calabar campus of the university. When contacted on Friday, the State Commissioner of Police, CP Sikiru Akande said, “Please, if you have an issue, to protest is not the solution because unfortunately, for us, for every protest that you want to do, now will spill into the streets. “The moment you give them that space they will take advantage of it and unleash mayhem, so please until further notice we don’t want any street protest in any part of Cross River State until we are sure we are able to clean the state of all elements that are likely to cause a problem, “Just like what happened this morning the student they are protesting for is not even a student of the University, he is a community boy that was attacked by some cultists and some of the cultists have been arrested, still some idiots gathered themselves under the guise of protesting the death of the student/ “And want to go and burn the administrative building of the school, who is at loss, if some people don’t want to go to school, let them let us know, they should go back to the farm and stop disturbing others, any attempt by any group of persons under any guise to disturb the relative peace, will be matched with force” he stated.
