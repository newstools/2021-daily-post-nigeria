The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo State has again accused Governor Hope Uzodinma of impoverishing the people of the State. The Imo PDP Director-General of New Media, Collins Opuruzor made the accusation on his Facebook page. He said the State where the Governor had superintended for more than one year was now the most deteriorated environment for business and investors in the country, according to the statistics of Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC).

The party spokesman said, “out of the 52.3 million dollars that came to the Southeast as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), in the last thirteen months, Abia and Anambra states got about 88percent of the total sum, while Enugu took the rest. Imo got zero! “The regime of Uzodinma has squandered a whooping 1.2billion naira to run for a Ministry of Foreign affairs in a state that has no business climate for investors. “There is a deliberate policy to cripple the entire system and bring the people down, so as to ensure they remain dependent on the government to survive. This is most dehumanizing!” He observed that the majority of his party members were now crawling around the Governor for crumbs. We know those behind Imo attacks – Gov Uzodinma
The Governor, according to him, had succeeded in impoverishing the people, and now invites them for a town hall meeting at the Government House in order to give them feeding money.
