France striker, Karim Benzema, has finally reacted to his country’s elimination from Euro 2020. France was knocked out of the European Championship on Monday by Switzerland.

Reacting, Benzema, in a post via his Instagram account, said: “Sad and disappointed after yesterday’s match. The disappointment is immense, I would have liked to continue to make you vibrate for a long time. Thank you for your unwavering support since the start of this Euro. “Thank you for the strength you have given me daily. “Nothing is ever easy, we continue to fight to prepare for the future and come back even stronger.”
