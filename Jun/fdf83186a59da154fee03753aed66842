President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday turned down a question on the suspension of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria. Recall that the Minister of information and Tourism, Lai Mohammed, had last Friday announced the indefinite suspension of Twitter’s operations in the country. Mohammed said the government was forced to act because of “the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence.” The suspension of Twitter has continued to spark widespread outrage, with many Nigerians condemning the move. However, when asked on Arise TV when the Twitter ban would be lifted, Buhari declined to comment, saying he would “keep” the answer to himself. “I will keep that to myself,” the president said.
