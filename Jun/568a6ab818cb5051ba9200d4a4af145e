The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, has said that the Federal Government would soon take a decision to recall civil servants working from home back to work. Mustapha said this in Abuja on Wednesday at the 2021 commemoration of Public Service Day, organised by the Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR), with the theme ”Building the Africa we want through the impact and value of Public Service Organisations to the Society.” Represented by the Permanent Secretary, General Services in the Office of the SGF, Maurice Mbaeri, Mustapha stressed that all issues that necessitated the work from home order have been addressed. ”You will all agree with me that the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged everyone, including governance and its operation. ”Nevertheless, the federal government is committed to building a public service that is capable, efficient, open, inclusive, and accountable institutions, which are critical for sustainable growth and inclusive national development after COVID-19. ”The federal government’s e–government master plan currently being implemented, is innovation and technology pooled to deliver services. ”The e–government master plan is intended to equip public servants with skills necessary to be effective, responsive and relevant in the digital age. ”Therefore, I wish to use this medium to encourage all civil and public servants to carry out their roles with dedication and a commitment to the civil service and its core values of integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality. ”I am glad to salute all public servants across the globe, especially our Nigerian patriotic public and civil servants whose contributions to the growth and development of our dear nation cannot be over emphasised,” NAN quoted him as saying.
