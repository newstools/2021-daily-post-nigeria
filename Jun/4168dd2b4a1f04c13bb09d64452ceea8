Nollywood actress, Eucharia Anunobi has recounted the hardships she experienced while growing up, adding that her father refused to send her to school. The actress narrated her experience in a post she shared via her Instagram account on Tuesday while celebrating her recently acquired Ph.D degree. According to her, her father, even though he was rich, refused to cater for her education because he felt it was useless sending a girl child to school. She, however, noted that regardless of what her situation was, she worked hard to ensure that she engraved her father’s name on the map of the world adding, that God’s grace saw her through. ”I’m still in awe of God. He changes destinies in a twinkling of an eye, he is a rule-breaker and he doesn’t need anyone’s permission to bless another. ”Just look at the girl, whose rich father refused to train after high school, that he had no need for a girl child. That he rather concentrate and train the male children to any level of education that they desire. ”This girl child struggled all by herself and is a model, a former beauty queen, a famous superstar actress, a preacher. Right now, that girl child is a Ph.D. holder in Christian education and Ministerial Arts. ”Today she has engraved her father’s name on the map of the world and still craves it and will keep craving it until the return of Jesus Christ. ‘I’m that girl child and my name is Apostle Dr. Eucharia Akuwa Anunobi. I celebrate God on my behalf,” she wrote.
