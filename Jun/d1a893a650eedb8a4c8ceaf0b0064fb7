David Maiyaki, a lawmaker representing Karu/ Gitata at the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, has defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress ( APC). Ibrahim Abdullahi, the speaker of the House, announced this while reading the defection letter during plenary in Lafia on Monday. Abdullahi, while congratulating the lawmaker for joining APC, assured him of equal treatment as other members of the party. The speaker said the APC remains a party to beat in 2023 in the state. “You have taken a wise decision. I congratulate you on the step taken, you have taken the best step. I want to assure you of equal rights with other members of the party. “We have caught another big fish, I want to assure you of our cooperation and support to enable you to succeed. “With the defection, we have completed ten members from the Western zone as APC lawmakers,” he said. Earlier, Maiyaki said he decided to join APC in the best interest of the people of his constituency and the state at large. The lawmaker who was the Chairman, House Committee on Land and Survey, said he consulted widely with his people on his decision to move from PDP to APC. With the defection of the lawmaker, APC now has 20 members, leaving PDP with three members, while the Zenith labour party (ZLP) has one at the House.
