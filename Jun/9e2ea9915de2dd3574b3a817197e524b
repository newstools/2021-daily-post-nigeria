Ajayi, in a statement said: “It is quite gladdening that a lawmaker, a Senator will tell us what the position of the law is. For him to say that there is no such law is quite gladdening but our position in Afenifere is that if there were such a law, we will want to know when it was promulgated and to what extent it should cover. “In any case, such a law will be obsolete and it will not be binding. For the senator to tell us that there is no such law, it is in tandem with our position. “The Federal Government should forget the idea about reopening any grazing route.”
