A family member of embattled Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju Omiyinka, popularly known as Baba Ijesha, has disclosed why Damilola Adekoya, popularly known as Princess, wants to tarnish the actor’s image. Ewatomilola Ayeni, a self-acclaimed niece of Baba Ijesha, said Princess wants to tarnish the actor’s image due to his rising fame. Ayeni disclosed this at the Yaba Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State while addressing journalists. She insisted that the actor is not a pedophile because she lived with him and he never abused her sexually. Princess seduced Baba Ijesha, went naked before him severally – Niece Ayeni urged the government to carry out a proper investigation on the allegation against Baba Ijesha. “I have lived with him all my life and he never abused me. They want to tarnish his image because of his fame. “The government should ensure that the innocent does not die in the place of the guilty because anyone who hears one side of the matter without hearing the other side is evil, because he (Baba Ijesha) knows nothing about this case,” she said. The Lagos State Police Command had arrested Baba Ijesha, a comic actor, on April 22, 2021 for alleged rape. The actor was picked up after Princess accused him of defiling a 14-year-old girl in her custody. Comedian Princess reacts as Police grants Baba Ijesha bail
