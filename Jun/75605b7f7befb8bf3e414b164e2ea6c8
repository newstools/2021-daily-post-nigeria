Your just announced planned trip to London to see your doctors next week is one trip too many. “You have refused to build hospitals for Nigerians, and if by July 10, you are still in London, then prepare for the Mother of All #HarassBuhariOutofLondon. “You have had six years to develop the health sector. If you can spend $1.9 billion of Nigeria’s money to build a railway in Niger Republic, then you could have built hospitals to cater to your health and the health of Nigerians”.
