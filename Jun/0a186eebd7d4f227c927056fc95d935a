Member representing Kabba-Bunu/Ijumu Federal Constituency of Kogi state, Honourable Teejay Yusuf has revealed that Zamfara State Governor, Alhaji Bello Matawalle, had been in secret alliance with the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the past one year and four months before his defection. He said his antics was known by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), hence they were not surprised. In a statement he made a available to DAILY POST on Wednesday in Abuja, the lawmaker described the Zamfara Governor as a pawn who has made himself available on APC’s 2023 chessboard. He asserted that it was in the PDP’s interest that highly-placed members with suspicious loyalty should take their exit and enable PDP to sort out itself before the next election. “Water will always find its level; it is sad that after being elevated into governorship, Mutawalle is now a mere pawn running helter-skelter in desperate pursuit of a return ticket he’s hardly qualified for with his very dim performance and the outrageous explosion of insecurity under his watch,” he said. He wondered how such an unserious politician like Matawalle would be celebrated, noting that he has failed woefully as governor of the state in the last two years. According to him, PDP is not a desperate party looking for desperate politicians, adding that the likes of Bello Matawalle should exit to allow serious politicians come on board ahead of 2023 general election. “After all the utopian promises of 2014, APC has foisted decadence in all sectors yet, you can see the number of governors and Federal officials who dropped their statutory responsibilities for a frivolous trip to welcome a thoroughly underwhelming performer”, he stated. Hon. Yusuf believed that the governor has bitten the hand that fed him, stating that he would be a political orphan in his newly found party. Defection: Why our Governors are joining APC – PDP
