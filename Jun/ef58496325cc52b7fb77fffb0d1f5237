A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP and a former governorship aspirant, Barr Ike Oligbo has called on the 16 aspirants of the party to negotiate among themselves and reduce the number of aspirants in the party for ease of management. Oligbo who spoke to journalists in Awka said it would be fair if the party goes to the primary election on Saturday with fewer aspirants, saying it would be easier for the party to manage. The politician said he is aware of peace accords and various meetings that the aspirants have held, which he said include plans to help them make negotiations and prune their numbers. “Politics is politics and people will disagree. What the party can do is to appeal for some of them to step down for others. “If an agreement can be reached, we may have just four aspirants, and that will be easy to manage. Let them talk among themselves and get who they feel is capable of winning the November 6 election for the party. “Let’s choose someone who has the tenacity and the acceptability to win. I am sure there is a process to prune down the number of aspirants. They have been holding meetings and when we go for the election tomorrow, we may just hear that some have stepped down for the others,” Oligbo said. 16 aspirants are expected to slug it out in the governorship primary which holds in Awka on Saturday. They include Hon Chuma Nzeribe, Mrs Chidi Onyemelukwe, Engr Chris Azubogu, Val Ozigbo, Dr Obiora Okonkwo, Mrs Genevieve Ekwochi, Godwin Maduka, Mr Godwin Ezeemo, Senator Uche Ekwunife and Senator Ugochukwu Uba. Others are; Johnny Maduafokwa, Tony Nwoye, Barr Winston Udeh, Barr Emeka Etiaba, Walter Okeke and Ifedi Okwenna.
