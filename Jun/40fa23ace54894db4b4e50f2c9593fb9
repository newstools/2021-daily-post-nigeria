Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday struck out a suit seeking to stop the appointment of 18 new Justices for the Court of Appeal. Justice Ekwo threw out the case on the grounds that it lacked merit in law and in substance. Delivering judgment in the public interest suit, the Judge held that the body that instituted the case has no power under the law to file a public interest case. Justice Ekwo said the plaintiff having been registered as a non-governmental body to raise funds for charity only in law cannot go outside its mandate to dabble into issues of public interest litigation.
