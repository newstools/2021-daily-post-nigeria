An FCT High Court, Kubwa, has fixed July 5 for the definite hearing in a case against five friends. Justus Alex, Victor Alex, Marcus Eze, Asogwa Johnson and John Ofor face four counts of armed robbery and abduction filed by the police. Justice Kezziah Ogbonnaya fixed the date after prosecution counsel, Sadiq Haruna announced he had made rearrangements with the court registrar to serve the defendantsâ€™ sureties. The sureties could not be served due to the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) strike. The defendants are accused of robbing one Theophilus Kelechi and three others of five phones, one digital camera and N50,000 cash at Nandu Plaza, Wuse Zone 5, Abuja on October 15, 2019. They also allegedly abducted Chief Benard Nwora from his office at Suite 52 of the same plaza and took him to Ado village in Nasarawa. According to the prosecution, they demanded N50 million ransom from his wife, Bethel. The police recovered two pistols, six live cartridges without licence from the friends in Ado on October 16, 2019. Their offences contravened the provisions of Section 2(3) of the Robbery & Firearms Special Provision Act Cap 398 LFN 1990 and Section 273 of the Penal Code. All the suspects have pleaded not guilty.
