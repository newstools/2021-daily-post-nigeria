The House of Representatives has rejected a motion calling for the opening of land borders. The motion to open land borders was moved by Kolawole Lawal from Ogun State, however, the lawmakers opposed the bill. Lawal had called for the opening of the Idiroko border in Ogun State and other borders. The lawmaker argued that the closure is affecting the people living around the border. Speaking in support of the prayers of the motion, Sergious Ogun from Edo State argued that the policy of the government has not worked to prevent smuggling. Isiaka Ibrahim said the government needs to change its strategy on preventing smuggling instead of closing borders. “We have tested the closure, the government should know that it is not working, they need to change strategy,” he said. Speaking against the motion, Beni Lar from Plateau State argued that the closure of the border has helped the agricultural sector. The Deputy Speaker, Idris Wase, also from Plateau State, argued that the government is still committed to the ECOWAS protocol. When the motion was put to question by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, it was negatived.
