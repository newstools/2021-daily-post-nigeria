Liverpool forward, Mohamed Salah, has been named winner of the 2020/2021 Premier League PFA Fans’ Player of the Year award. The 28-year-old Egyptian scored 22 times and provided five assists, even as the Reds failed to hold onto their title. Jurgen Klopp’s men finished third behind Manchester United and champions Manchester City. Fans have, however, appreciated Salah’s impressive displays and overwhelmingly voted him as their best-performing player of the campaign. Salah bagged 31 goals across all competitions last season and provided six assists in 50 appearances. He has won the Premier League Golden Boot twice and the Player of the Season, among other individual accolades, since arriving at Anfield in 2017.
