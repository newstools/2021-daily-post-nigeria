The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council in Enugu West Senatorial Zone has lauded the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Enugu State, Hon. Augustine Nnamani, for “standing by the truth” in the contentious issues of zoning in the State. DAILY POST had reported that Nnamani, at a rally organized by the Enugu East Senatorial zone on Thursday, said the PDP was yet to zone the governorship position. Reacting, the youth group said the stand of the PDP chairman had vindicated its age long declaration that there was no zoning arrangement in the State. A statement issued by the group was signed by the Youth Leader, Ohanaeze Oji River, and the coordinating Chairman of the five local government youth leaders in Enugu West, Hon Chuks Oneh. The youth group equally hailed Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of the state who said at the rally that he stands for justice. “We received with delight the open declaration of the PDP Chairman in Enugu State that the party had not zoned the governorship position to any zone. We thank him for standing by the truth. “It is a clear vindication of our earlier stand that at no time did the people of Enugu State put up any zoning arrangement. “With this, all proponents of zoning should go and rest, the deciding factor now should be justice. “It is on this note that we thank His Excellency, the peace loving Governor of Enugu State for saying at the same rally that he stands for justice. “The justice that should be done in 2023 is to allow Enugu West produce the next Governor considering that Enugu East has gone three times, Enugu North two times, whereas West has had only one occupied of that office,” it said. “We plead with the Governor to ensure that the people of Enugu West get justice in this regard.” It also condemned the closure of major markets in the State, stressing that “the organizers of that rally ought to know that some people feed through their daily earnings. So, we didn’t deem it appropriate.”
