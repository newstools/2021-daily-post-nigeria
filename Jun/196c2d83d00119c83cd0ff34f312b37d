The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State has described Saturday’s killings in Igangan, Ibarapa North Local Government Area, as one too many, and urged Governor Seyi Makinde to promptly convoke a security summit. The APC said the summit would seek to find a lasting solution to the security challenges facing the state. This was contained in a statement signed by its Publicity Secretary, Dr AbdulAzeez Olatunde and made available to newsmen on Sunday in Ibadan. Recall that several people were killed in Igangan, Ibarapa area of Oyo State on Saturday night when unknown gunmen invaded the community. The APC appealed to Makinde to forget the rhetoric of having Àmotekun and Operation Burst, adding that both had shown to be ineffective. The party added that it wouldn’t stop advising the governor to be proactive and stop playing lip service or politics with the security issues in the state. Makinde reacts as gunmen invade Igangan, kill scores “Obviously and certainly, the current situation of Oyo State was not what Makinde and PDP took over from the immediate past APC government in the state under Gov. Abiola Ajimobi in 2019. “The excuse of general security issues has been with us in Nigeria since 2009 even before Ajimobi took over the mantle of governance in 2011. In spite of the issues, Ajimobi secured Oyo State,” it said. The APC said that it was obvious that there were security lapses all over the state, saying Makinde also admitted the carnage which occurred in Eruwa area of Ibarapa East during the May 22 local government election.
