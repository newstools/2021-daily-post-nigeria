The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, has broken his silence on the suspension of micro blogging and social network platform, Twitter, in Nigeria. Recall that the Minister of information and Tourism, Lai Mohammed, had last Friday announced the indefinite suspension of Twitter’s operations in the country. Mohammed stated that the government was forced to act because of “the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence.” The suspension of Twitter has continued to spark widespread outrage, with many Nigerians condemning the move. Reacting to the development, Lawan said that Nigeria and Twitter need each other. He spoke at a briefing in Abuja to mark the second anniversary of the 9th Senate on Friday. “Our belief is that Nigeria needs Twitter just as Twitter needs Nigeria,“ Lawan said. “Our expectation is that we will be able to resolve this issue. ”But beyond that, I am optimistic and I believe that all of us would have learnt our lessons.” He added: “I believe this is the worst level we could get to. We cannot go beyond this level, it could only be better. “I believe we are going to have a reversal of this situation very soon. We shouldn’t despair, we shouldn’t be despondent. We should have hope and optimism that our situation will be better.” Buhari’s tweet: Twitter finally shut down in Nigeria
