The Osun State Command of Federal Road Safety Corps has launched operation ‘Lights For Life’ specifically targeting vehicle light sign violations. The command would from Tuesday, clamp down on vehicles with defective lighting systems, such as bad rear lights and fixing of beacon lights in place of headlamps. In a statement by the command’s Public Education Officer, Agnes Ogungbemi, the Sector Commander, Paul Okpe, attributed most Road Traffic Crashes occurring at night to motorists that evade arrests during the day, with most of their vehicles having defective lighting systems.
