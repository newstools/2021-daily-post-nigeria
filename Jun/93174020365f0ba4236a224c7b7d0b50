The Senior Pastor and General Overseer of Omega Fire Ministries International, Apostle Johnson Suleman, has slammed the Federal Government for hosting a press conference after Twitter deleted President Buhari’s threat tweet against the South East. President Muhammadu Buhari’s had threatened to shock Nigerians who are out to destroy his Government. His tweet caused an outrage on social media which led to Nigerians calling for the suspension of his account for making such insensitive comment and issuing threats to a particular region. However, on Wednesday Twitter deleted the comment, saying it violated its rules. Following the development, Minister of information and Culture, Lai Mohammed during a press conference after Twitter deleted Buhari’s tweet said the president has the right to express his idea on the current security challenges. According to him, “If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views.” Reacting, Suleman on his Twitter handle on Thursday, slammed the Minister who decided to hold a press conference to tackle Twitter for deleting Buhari’s tweet in which he made a reference to the civil war. He also wondered why the minister failed to hold such conferences after school children were kidnapped and news of bandits butchering innocent citizens everyday emerged. “School children were kidnapped, no federal press conference addressed it. “People are killed daily, no word of stern threat to the bandits. “A tweet was deleted and you had a press conference? Define joblessness!! Many are mad, few are roaming,” he wrote. Daddy Freeze challenged to heal mad man in Lucifer’s name
