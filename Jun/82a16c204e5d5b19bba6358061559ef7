Joe Joyce’s manager, Sam Jones, has said that the boxer could fight Anthony Joshua in Nigeria. Joyce could become the mandatory challenger to heavyweight king Joshua and enforce a world title fight. On July 24, the undefeated Joyce will face Carlos Takam, while Joshua will defend his IBF, WBA and WBO titles against Oleksandr Usyk in September. “There is a possibility Joe and Joshua could fight in Nigeria. “They are both of Nigerian descent, so that could be huge. “If AJ needs a dance partner in Nigeria, look no further. That fight would be something very, very special,” Jones told Sky Sports.
