“I believe we have all aired our grievances, discussed it and move on. “ According to her, everyone acted mature and had the opportunity to trash every issue and throw tantrums; hence, such attitude should continue because she believes that everyone has aired the grievances, discussed, and moved on. “Please whatever you couldn’t or didn’t say to me should remain unsaid and buried. Don’t t be a push. We all did put a great show. Now let the viewers and the fans of the show get entertained,” her post read.
