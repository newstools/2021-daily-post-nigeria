Ahead of the June 28 commencement of the nationwide INEC Voterâ€™s Registration/Revalidation exercise, several sociopolitical groups in Nigeria have advised Igbos and Nigerians to take the exercise very serious as it will give credence to the Equity and Justice project in 2023. Among the groups include the Pan Nigeria Presidency of Igbo Extraction Coalition (PANPIEC), World Igbo Peoples Assembly (WIPAS), Coalition of Civil Society Organization of Nigeria (COCSON), and Nigeria Peoples Parliament (NPP). DAILY POST recalls that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had announced June 28 the commencement of a nationwide continuous Voter Registration to deepen the use of technology in the electoral process. The registration exercise is aimed at shoring up the number of voters across the country and to discourage voter apathy.

However, the Nigerian sociopolitical groups in a statement on Thursday called on civil society groups, traditional and religious leaders to take the programme seriously and mobilise their people to participate, especially younger people that have turned 18 years and above. They advised Igbos to come out in large numbers and prove to Nigerians that they are ready to lead them in 2023. The sociopolitical organizations noted that they would be visiting stakeholders all over the country to conscientize Nigerians on the project but advised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure the programme is not muddled for any reason.
