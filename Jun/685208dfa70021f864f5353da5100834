The youth wing of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Ohanaeze Youth Council, OYC, has slammed the Southeast Governors for disowning the secessionist group, Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. DAILY POST recalls that the five governors under the umbrella of South-East Governors’ Forum, on June 19 declared their stance against IPOB, stating that the group does not speak for Igbos. Governor Dave Umahi, Chairman of the forum, stated this while addressing newsmen shortly after their meeting in Enugu State. Reacting, in a statement issues by the Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to OYC National President, Chukwuemeka Chimerue, the group accused the governors of being blind to the reality of Igbos. According to the statement, the OYC national president, Comrade Igboayaka O. Igboayaka stated this while addressing press conference. He noted that “It’s obvious that Southeast governors and stakeholders have lost sense of reality on ground as regards the quest for self-determination by many pro-Biafra groups.

“Let the world understand and know the truth that Southeast governors and stakeholders are the remote cause of any perceived violence by self-determination groups in Igbo land, that is why all the self-determination groups are headed by Ndigbo, this implies that Ndigbo are in lack of credible leaders and denied of justice in Nigeria. “The groups agitating for independence in Igbo land are not just the wind but a ‘tsunami wind’ that will blow and cause Southeast governors and all the stakeholders in Igbo land to summersault beyond recognition.”
