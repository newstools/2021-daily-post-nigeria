Vice President Yemi Osinbajo says the recent supplementary budget sent to the National Assembly will help the federal government end insecurity in Nigeria. Osinbajo spoke when he received the Oluyin of Iyin Ekiti, Oba Adeola Adeniyi Ajakaiye at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. At the meeting was the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo and Senator Opeyemi Bamidele. The VP appealed urged traditional rulers, local and state governments to collaborate with the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to tackle current challenges. Osinbajo recalled that Buhari recently constituted a committee to look at the security infrastructure of the country. “The result of that is a bill before the National Assembly, a supplementary bill. The purpose is to present some of the needs of the military and other security agencies to beef up our response. “I can assure you that soon, the issue of insecurity will be a thing of the past. We will all live in peace and prosperity in this country.” The VP advocated vigilance at the local level, noting that most of the troubling issues occur in communities.
