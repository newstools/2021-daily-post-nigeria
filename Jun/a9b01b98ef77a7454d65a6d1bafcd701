Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has praised the courage and desire of the Nigerian citizenry to allow democracy thrive after two decades of it. The governor, in a statement to newsmen by his Press Secretary, Humwashi Wonosikou, said that 22 years of uninterrupted democracy is indeed something to thank God for. He stressed that democracy is at the heart of addressing the defining challenges of the times with rising regional agitations, insecurity, poverty and the COVID-19 pandemic. “Today, we celebrate the return to civil rule, the restoration of our dignity and the democratic resilience we have built over the last two decades,” Fintiri stated. He commended the Adamawa electorate for trusting him with their mandate and assured them of his best not to let them down. He said, “Our desire to strengthen democracy and give it its true meaning informed the investment we are making in the social reengineering of the state through the provision of infrastructure and human capital development. “The projects spread across the state represents the value and meaning of Democracy Day.” Nigerians losing money to fraudulent investment schemes – EFCC
