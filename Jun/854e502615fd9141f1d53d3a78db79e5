England boss, Gareth Southgate, has explained why he omitted Phil Foden from his side’s squad to face Czech Republic at Wembley Stadium on Tuesday night at the Euro 2020. Southgate said he didn’t include Foden for England’s final Group D match against the Czech Republic at Euro 2020 because he doesn’t want to risk the Manchester City star having another yellow card that would have seen him suspended for the last 16. The Three Lions boss made four changes to his starting XI that was held to a goalless draw by Scotland last Friday, with Kyle Walker, Bukayo Saka, Harry Maguire and Jack Grealish coming into the squad. “He [Foden] is on a yellow card and given that we look like we are missing two players already for the next round, I don’t want to take a risk on a third,” Southgate told ITV Sport ahead of kick-off. “It’s a shame for Phil, but I think it is a sensible decision.” He added, “But you have got a game where there is a prize because we want to stay at Wembley and it is a good opportunity for people. “We want to play winning football, but the consequences of not doing so well is less fatal, so it’s a great night for our attacking players to go and express themselves.”
