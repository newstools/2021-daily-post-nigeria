The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, on Tuesday, distanced itself from Saturday’s outcome of its primary election currently circulating on some social media platforms. The APC described the results as fake and urged the general public, especially party members, to disregard them. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that some unverified results of the APC primary election are circulating in some sections of social media. Reacting to the development, the APC Spokesman, Seye Oladejo, told NAN who sought authenticity of the results presently circulating on the social media, that the results were fictitious and misleading. Outcome of Southwest congress will determine future of PDP – Gov Makinde Oladejo said, “The publication of fake and unverified results can heat up the polity unnecessarily. It is unprofessional and unethical. Patience remains a virtue. “Please, disregard these results. They are not authentic,” he said. NAN reports that the ruling party on Saturday conducted an open secret ballot primary across wards in the 20 Local Governments and 37 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs). The election was aimed at selecting its chairmanship and councillorship flag-bearers, ahead of the July 24 council poll. The primary election was, however, not without some hitches, as there were reported cases of disruption, violence and ballot box snatches in some wards. The results of the primaries are still being expected to be announced at the APC state secretariat, 48 hours after the exercise. $1BN arms deal allegation: Group advocates immediate probe of Nigerian army, others
