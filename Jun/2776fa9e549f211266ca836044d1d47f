The party can only field one candidate despite the fact that as the foremost political platform in the state, all its aspirants are qualified and capable. “Now that the primary process has been completed, we have to move round to talk to all our stakeholders, make necessary reconciliation and give more assurance. Anambra State is naturally a PDP State. We need to use the November election to re-affirm this. “This election is important for us to re-assure the people that PDP and its candidate will work tirelessly to ensure that Anambra claims its rightful position as a leading state in Nigeria, the one that can create a prosperous, developed and conducive atmosphere for all residents”, he stated.
