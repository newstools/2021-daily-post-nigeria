Deji Adeyanju, an Abuja-based activist, on Wednesday hinted on candidates the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stakeholders are considering to field as presidential candidate in 2023. Adeyanju, convener of Concerned Nigerians claimed that PDP stakeholders are considering either Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State or Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State. In a series of tweets, the former PDP member claimed that the party’s stakeholders are tired of fielding Atiku Abubakar as its presidential candidate. PDP will return to power in 2023 – Tambuwal
The activist claimed that PDP stakeholders are angry with Atiku for allegedly abandoning the party in the 2015 elections. According to Adeyanju: “PDP stakeholders want to present Tambuwal or Bala Mohammed both serving Governors as presidential candidates and someone from South as VP in 2023. “They say everybody is tired of the Dubai man with dollars. Why won’t you guys present him now? I want to see you guys in opposition for 16yrs. Tambuwal doing well in office – Obasanjo
“Many of them are so pained that the man abandoned their party after the election and relocated to Dubai for two years but is now back to start campaigning for another ticket. “The only way PDP can get real sense is if they spend 16yrs in opposition. APC should present an acceptable candidate in 2023.”
