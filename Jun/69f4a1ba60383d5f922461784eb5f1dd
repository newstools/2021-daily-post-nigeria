Another policeman has been killed in Ogun State, DAILY POST reports. The policeman, a sergeant was murdered at Igbeba, Ijebu-Igbo area of the state. The murder of the police sergeant is coming barely four days after an Inspector of police was killed by kidnappers, who abducted four Chinese expatriates at a village in Odeda. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST on Sunday. According to Oyeyemi, the police sergeant, whose identity was not disclosed, was targeted and attacked around 11pm on Saturday. The police spokesman told our correspondent that the cop was not on duty when he was killed by those he identified as suspected cultists. “It is true a policeman was killed by suspected cultists. But that policeman was not on duty, he was off duty at that time. I think he was going somewhere around 10:30/11pm on Saturday night when he was killed. He was no longer on duty at the time of the incident. “A suspect has been arrested. The suspect happens to be a member of the Eiye confraternity,” Oyeyemi said, adding that other members of the gang are still being hunted.
