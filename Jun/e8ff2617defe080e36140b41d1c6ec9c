Barcelona president, Joan Laporta, has confirmed Ronald Koeman will continue as manager next season. This comes after weeks of uncertainty surrounding the Dutchman’s future. On Thursday, Laporta had said a “period of reflection” was needed after two wins in their last six fixtures saw Barca miss out on the LaLiga title. The Catalans finished outside the top two for the first time since 2008, although they did landed the Copa del Rey.
