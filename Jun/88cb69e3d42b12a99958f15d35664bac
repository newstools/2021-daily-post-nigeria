The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in Imo seized 646kg of hard drugs and arrested 60 suspected drug traffickers from January to June, 2021. NDLEA Commander, Nse Inam, made the disclosure in Owerri, the state capital, on the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking. The seized drugs include cannabis sativa, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and Tramadol. Inam said the Federal Government’s Special Boarder Task Force transferred 4,784kg of cannabis sativa to the command. The official confirmed eight convictions were secured, 47 drug users counselled, and 15 drug addicts admitted, two of whom were rehabilitated and discharged. Inam assured that the NDLEA will ensure Imo is not a safe haven for illicit drug activities. “We will beam our searchlight on patent medicine dealers so that they do not continue as active channels for sale. “We will go after assets of illicit drug users and those who allow their property to be used for the business”, he vowed.
