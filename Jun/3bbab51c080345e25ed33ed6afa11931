Festus Keyamo, the Minister of Labour and Employment, has disclosed that some members of the All Progressives Congress, APC, attempted to hijack the 774,000 Special Works Scheme under this dispensation. Keyamo disclosed that President Muhammadu Buhari, however, saved the scheme from being hijacked by the members. He disclosed this during the weekly Ministerial Media Chat at the State House yesterday. Tinubu, reason APC is in govt today – Keyamo, Sani
According to Keyamo: “Before the election of 2019, many of our APC members were mad. They were mad that this programme should be for APC so that we can use it to run elections. “But the President said no, the President would laugh despite all that; they were threatening that we are going to lose the election. PDP members were using this programme to empower their people in this state. “APC had nothing to empower. Didn’t the President win? He won; he won more people to his side by that.” The Special Public Works Programme was launched in 2021 by the Federal Government and aimed to employ 1000 youths across the 774 local government areas for three months.
