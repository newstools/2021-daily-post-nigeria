Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila has reminded the All Progressives Congress (APC) that the platform will give account for its leadership of Nigeria. The Lagos federal lawmaker spoke on Monday in Abuja at the 2021 Progressives Youth Conference. Gbajabiamila stressed that the party needed to identify competent people both at home and in the diaspora and bring them on board. The speaker said translating good manifestos into policies by political parties remained the foundation for achievements. Political party manifestos, he noted, are a statement of vision, the foundation of all achievements. “For a nation such as ours to succeed, we must first define a common vision that will inspire us, bring us together, and provide the focus that allows us to persevere through the inevitable difficult times. “Political parties exist to mobilise public support to form a government and to superintend over the affairs of the state. “To be successful in this regard, political parties must reflect in their membership, the broad spectrum of the society it seeks to govern. “The commitments contained in the party manifesto are the basis upon which the party’s record in government will be measured and its leaders will be assessed both in real-time and in the judgment of history. “As it has been throughout history, so also will it be for us in the All Progressives Congress as we too will answer for what we have done with our time in government.” Gbajabiamila insisted that the APC has accomplished much despite “the many obstacles”. He added that there is still more to do in the two years left in the tenure of the present administration.
