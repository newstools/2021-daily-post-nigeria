The Premier League and the ‘Big Six’ clubs are close to reaching an agreement on punishment they would face for attempting to join the European Super Eagle, according to Daily Mail. Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham all pulled out of the controversial breakaway plans within days of them being announced, Their decision came after outrage from across the football world. The six English clubs would have joined Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan, AC Milan and Juventus in a rebel European league. They will now face punishment for their involvement in the plans. But it will be in the form of fines rather than points deductions. It is understood the Big Six want a punishment similar to that given by UEFA last month, which saw each fined around £1.5million. The money would be donated to children’s and grassroots football across the continent.
