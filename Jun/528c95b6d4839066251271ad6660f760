Manchester United legend, Wayne Rooney, has named Chelsea midfielder, N’Golo Kante, as the best midfielder in the world. Rooney said this ahead of Kante’s participation in this summer’s Euro 2020, which kicks off on June 11. The former England striker believes Kante has the characteristics of both former Manchester City midfielder, Yaya Toure, and former Chelsea star, Claude Makelele. Kante played a key role for Chelsea in their Champions League victory over Manchester City last month as Thomas Tuchel and his men secured the title a second time in the club’s history. EPL: Wayne Rooney blasts Tottenham for sacking Mourinho “Kante does everything: breaks up play but then plays in tight areas and starts off the attack,” Rooney told The Times. “You used to see it with Yaya Toure, how he would get the ball and burst forward with it and it’s so hard to defend against. Kante does all that but also protects his defence like Claude Makelele once did – only better. “It’s unbelievable to have a footballer who is Toure and Makelele rolled into one — and then there is Kante’s energy. At Chelsea, you see his energy bringing a lot out of the other players.” EPL: Wayne Rooney names Premier league greatest ever foreign player
