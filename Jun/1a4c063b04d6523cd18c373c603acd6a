George Moghalu, an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, says the party would record a landslide victory at the election due to its followership. On Sunday, the former National Auditor of the suspended APC National Working Committee (NWC) said that contrary to assumption, the APC was a popular party in the state. “In the 2017 election in Anambra, we came second, we beat the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in that election. “The same Anambra people are there. When you marry two husbands, ask women, they will tell you. Anambra people have married two husbands and the third one is waiting which is APC. “And we are asking them to marry us this time so that they will be in a position to compare the first, second and this husband that is coming,” he said. Moghalu, who is the Managing Director of the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), added that the APC was taking over governance in Anambra with a commitment and determination to change the narrative and to ensure real development.
