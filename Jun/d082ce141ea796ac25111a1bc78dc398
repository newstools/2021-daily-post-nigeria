President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the Revised National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) and the National Climate Change Programmes for Nigeria. The president gave his assent to the new policy at the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting on Wednesday. The Revised National Climate Change Policy is expected to implement mitigation procedures already put in place in the country and promote the low-carbon, high-growth economic development plan for a sustainable climate. The Minister of Environment, Dr Muhammad Mohammed Abubakar who disclosed the President’s approval said it captures emerging issues in the country’s climate change mitigation programme. Climate Change: Buhari hails Biden for rejoining Paris Agreement Issues such as “the inclusion of the 2015 Paris Agreement and Gender mainstreaming, which are very relevant to the national response to climate change”. The plan of action for the new National Policy on Climate Change is expected to run through 2021-2030 says Dr Abubakar. The National Climate Change programmes document complements the National Policy by identifying measures and actions that will be implemented in a programmatic manner to address most, if not all, of the challenges posed by climate change and climate vulnerability in the country.
