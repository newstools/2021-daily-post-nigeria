A month later, another Buhari is threatening the Southeast with Nigerian Civil War 2 “How can one man have strikingly different reactions to similar events?” The Southeast had been witnessing serious insecurity challenges. Several government facilities like police stations and offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, have been burnt down by arsonists in the region. Following the increasing rate of insecurity in the Southeast, Buhari had vowed to deal with those he claimed were trying to destroy the country by promoting insurrection and burning down critical national assets. Buhari had threatened to clamp down on them very soon. According to his spokesman, Femi Adesina, Buhari spoke after he received a briefing from the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu, on the series of attacks on facilities of the electoral body around the country.
