A former presidential aide, Reno Omokri, has said he was not a supporter of the founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, late Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua popularly known as TB Joshua, saying the clergy’s source of power was unknown to him.
Recall that TB Joshua was confirmed dead on Sunday morning after hosting a programme in his church on Saturday night. DAILY POST reports that while millions of followers were despondent over the sudden demise, some Nigerians including top gospel preachers were celebrating his death saying he was ‘evil’. T.B Joshua confirmed dead Reno, in a post on his official Facebook page on Tuesday, said while the renowned prophet was alive, he (Reno) was mute over his activities when others were criticizing the man of God. He, however, slammed those celebrating the death saying it was wrong to attack someone who is dead. The post reads, “Whilst he lived, I never said anything about him. Neither good nor bad. Not because I did not like him, but because I do not know where his powers came from. Senate mourns TB Joshua “So, rather than say what I do not know, I kept mute. But now that he is dead, let him be. It is unChristlike to celebrate death, or mock the departed. “But beyond being unChristlike, it is also ungentlemanly to wait until someone is dead before you attack him. If you must attack, do so while he yet lives, that he may have a chance to defend himself. “Scripture asks us to “rejoice with those who rejoice, mourn with those who mourn”-Romans 12:15′.
