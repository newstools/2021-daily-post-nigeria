Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, a leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has vowed that the alleged attacks on his loyalists in the Southeast aiming at halting the the current agitation would not stop Biafra nation from emerging as a sovereign state. Kanu had severally accused the Nigerian Army and police operatives of killing IPOB members as a means of quelling the agitation. Meanwhile, the security agencies in the region had also accused the IPOB members and its security outfit, the Eastern Security Network, ESN of killing personnel and destroying government facilities. Nnamdi Kanu who is calling for a referendum to allow the secessionists decide whether to be part of Nigeria or a separate nation, said killings would not solve the problem. According to him, the actualization of Biafra would still take place despite the alleged killings. He made the remark on Thursday in a tweet via his official Twitter handle. The tweet reads, “At the end of this tortuous journey, history will record that referendum, NOT bullets, determined their fate. “It matters not how many they kill; one outcome is inevitable, Biafra MUST emerge a FREE nation. The sooner the Caliphate understand this inevitability, the better for all”.
