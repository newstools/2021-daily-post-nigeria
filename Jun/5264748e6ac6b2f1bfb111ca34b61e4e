Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, has said the Nigerian Army, police cannot withstand Boko Haram, bandits in the Northeast. Kanu made the remark while accusing Nigerian security operatives of killing Igbo youths while failing to curb terrorists in the Northeast. The IPOB leader lamented that DCP Abba Kyari and his team are killing imnocent youths in the Southeast. Speaking through the spokesman of IPOB, Emma Powerful, Kanu insisted that Kyari wrongly tagged innocent Igbo youths as unknown gunmen. Kanu’s remark was contained in a statement signed and issued by Powerful, on Monday. The statement reads: “It is unfortunate that super con cop DCP Abba Kyari and his team are killing Igbo youths and labeling them ESN and unknown gunmen. While, the Igbo efulefu elders and politicians has remain mute over the issue of killings, abductions and bribery practices for the release of their innocent victims. Super con cop DCP Abba Kyari’s home town, Gujba in Yobe State and his place of birth Maiduguri in Borno State are among the worst hit in terms of insecurity. “If truly DCP Abba Kyari is a super cop, he should have used his widely claimed tactics in intelligence field to help dislodge Boko Haram, ISWAP, and Bandits having field day in Northeast of Nigeria which is the region he came from (both Yobe & Borno are in northeast of Nigeria). After all, they say “charity begins at home.” “Time has proven that Nigerian soldiers and police, including DCP Abba Kyari and his IRT team cannot withstand Boko Haram, ISWAP and bandits operating in the North east where insurgency and insecurity is at large, why be zealous in killing innocent Biafrans, mainly of Igbo extraction?” IPOB: We promise you hell, ESN not cultists – Nnamdi Kanu dares Abba Kyari
