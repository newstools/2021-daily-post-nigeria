Mozzart Bet is offering the world’s highest odds in two friendlies – Russia vs Bulgaria and Wales vs Albania – this Saturday. Russia win over Bulgaria, odds 1.55 Russia have an imperious record at home, losing just twice in their last 13 fixtures, winning eight and drawing three in the process. Stanislav Cherchesov’s men will be looking to end their preparations for Euro 2020 with a win over Bulgaria to boost the morale of his charges. On the flip side, Bulgaria’s away record remains poor after winning just twice across their last 26 international matches. Kickoff: 6 PM (EAT) Wales win over Albania, odds 1.82 Wales are unbeaten on home soil since the start of 2020 after staging an impressive record of six games without a defeat and drawing only once. Albania have found it hard to keep clean sheets against top sides as their 1-0 friendly win vs Wales in November 2018 remains their last clean sheet overall vs a nation currently in FIFA’s top 20. Wales have won nine of their last 14 matches in all competitions and will be confident that they can go and get another victory this Saturday. Kickoff: 7 PM (EAT) MOZZART BET, be a Winner! Make a decision!
