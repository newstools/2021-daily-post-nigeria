The Senate on Wednesday passed the Firearms Act 2004 (Amendment) Bill 2021 raising the fine for illegal importation and sale of firearms from N1,000 to N1 million. The Bill was presented by the Chairman of the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters. Sen. Michael Bamidele. Bamidele held that the fine was initially at N1,000 in the extant Act which was not effective enough to curb illegal importation and sale of firearms. According to him, Section 35 of the Bill was amended to impose a fine of N3 million or three years jail term or both on anyone who failed to surrender illegal firearms to relevant authorities when directed to do so. He further noted that the Bill had become important due to the rapid increase in the illegal importation of firearms and the security challenges the country is currently facing. “Clause 39 of the Bill, which deals with power to seize and destroy confiscated illegal firearms, was also amended. “This is necessary because the power to seize illegal firearms should not be limited to a particular arm of force or law enforcement agency,’’ he said.
