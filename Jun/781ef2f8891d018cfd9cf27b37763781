Microblogging platform, Twitter has blocked India’s IT minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad for allegedly criticising the United States firm. Ravi Shankar Prasad who made the disclosure via a tweet on Friday after his account was restored, said in a “gross violation” of Indian regulations, the platform blocked his account without prior notice. He blasted the medium for blocking the account without warning him, alleging that Twitter does not practice the freedom of speech it claims to have been working for. “It is apparent that my statements calling out the high handedness and arbitrary actions of Twitter, particularly sharing the clips of my interviews to TV channels and its powerful impact, have clearly ruffled its feathers. “Twitter’s actions indicate that they are not the harbinger of free speech that they claim to be but are only interested in running their own agenda, with the threat that if you do not toe the line they draw, they will arbitrarily remove you from their platform,” he added.
