Former Big Brother Naija housemate, Lucy Edet, has taken a swipe at those slamming her over her demeanor during the reunion show. Lucy in a post via her Instagram account on Wednesday evening, recounted how people were quick to make jest of her for crying on different occasions while she was still in the house. According to her, these same set of people are the ones who also have a problem with her laughing so much while the reunion show was being aired. Lucy further told those attacking her to leave her alone because she is not the cause of their “mental unrest”. “In the house, I cried and a lot of people talked about it, now at the reunion I am laughing because I’m happy yet a lot of you are still complaining. “Is there anything I can do right in your eyes? Frankly, I don’t think so, leave me alone! I’m not the cause of your mental unrest,” she wrote. Recall that BBNaija reunion on Thursday night ended with a lot of drama with Kaisha and Lucy engaging in a physical fight.
