A farmer, Ibrahim Enboma, (26), has been arrested for inflicting injuries on a Fulani herder, Nasiru Sule, whom he accused of stealing guinea fowl eggs in his farm. The incident happened in Gwanara district of Kwara North Senatorial District on Tuesday. The spokesman of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps NSCDC, Kwara Command, Babawale Zaid Afolabi, disclosed this in a statement in Ilorin on Wednesday. He said trouble started when the farmer met the Fulani herder aged 17, on his farm on Tuesday, roasting some guinea fowl eggs which the farmer suspected were stolen from his farm. An altercation ensued between the two leading to a bloody encounter which resulted in the Fulani herder sustaining bodily injuries from machete cuts. “Argument reportedly ensued between the duo as Sule insisted that he did not steal the guinea fowl eggs from Ibrahim’s farm. ” The farmer was not satisfied with the Fulani’s claim of innocence and attacked him with a cutlass, leaving him in a pool of his blood,” the spokesman said. He said a passerby alerted NSCDC operatives who went to the scene of the incident, rescued the injured Fulani boy and rushed him to an undisclosed hospital where he is responding to treatment. The suspected farmer has been taken into NSCDC custody at Gwanara Division for interrogation and further investigation. Open grazing ban will prevent clashes between farmers, herders – Obaseki
