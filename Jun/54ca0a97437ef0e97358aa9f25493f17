Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has tasked journalists within and outside the state to improve on their reportage of the plight of displaced farmers in Benue from herdsmen attacks. Governor Ortom gave the charge on Wednesday after receiving ‘Culture Ambassador’ and ‘A Pillar of Club Football in Nigeria’ awards presented to him by the National Commission for Museums and Monuments as well as Nigeria Premier Football League Club Secretaries Forum respectively. While dedicating the awards to Benue people, the governor lamented that the state enjoys the appellation of Food Basket of the Nation due to the contributions of peasant farmers, thousands of whom are displaced and staying in Internally Displaced Persons camps. He noted that it portends danger to food security if the major actors in food production could not access their farms for years, stressing that sustained reportage on the matter would also go a long way in finding lasting solution. Governor Ortom acknowledged the support of the State Executive Council and people of the State to his administration, pointing out that the awards would spur his commitment and service to Benue people. The awards were presented to the Governor in recognition of his support for cultural development and advancement of the people of Benue State and his huge support Lobi Stars Football Club of Makurdi since the inception of his administration.
