Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka has taken a swipe at his team-mates, insisting he can “only be as good as the team”. The Switzerland international has agreed personal terms with Roma, where he will work under Jose Mourinho next season. Xhaka has been a favourite under Gunners manager, Mikel Arteta, with the Spaniard convincing him to stay in January 2020. Arsenal won the FA Cup and Community Shield last year but failed to build on that success and did not qualify for next season’s European football. Xhaka says he has been happy with his personal displays in the middle of the pitch and felt as if he had performed consistently. He told Blick: “Football is a team sport and you’re only as good as your team. Of course, it was a good year for me personally. “I’ve always played and performed, but the place at the end of the season is, of course, really bitter and disappointing for us”.
