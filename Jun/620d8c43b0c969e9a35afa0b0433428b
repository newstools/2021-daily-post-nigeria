Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger, has spoken about the alleged biting of Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, following France’s Euro 2020 1-0 victory over Germany on Tuesday night. France defeated Germany at the Allianz Arena, thanks to Mats Hummel’s first-half own goal. But Rudiger caused controversy before the half-time after he was caught allegedly biting Pogba when they were together off the ball. Pogba complained to the match referee, Carlos del Cerro Grande, who took no action, while VAR didn’t appear to review the incident. Reacting to the development, Rudiger admitted that he shouldn’t have come close with his mouth to Pogba’s back, adding that he spoke with the France international after the game. “I should not come close with my mouth to his back, no doubt about it,” Rudiger said at his post-match press conference. “It looks unfortunate. Paul and I have talked about it as friends after the final whistle.” Meanwhile, Pogba has since called on UEFA not to suspend Rudiger over the incident.
