Borno Governor, Babagana Zulum has suspended ACTED, a French non-governmental organization in the state. The directive followed Saturday’s discovery that the humanitarian body was using a hotel in the state capital for shooting training. Zulum’s spokesman, Isa Gusau announced the order in a statement. He said ACTED used toy guns and simulators in the exercises conducted at the location off Circular Road in Maiduguri. Residents had complained to the authorities that they were hearing gunshots. The matter was reported at the GRA Divisional Police headquarters and operatives found three toy pistols in the hotel during a search. Two trainers, both Nigerians are being detained and an investigation ongoing. Gusau noted that pending the outcome, the hotel will remain sealed. Additionally, ACTED has been barred from charitable activities in Borno. “Governor Zulum acknowledges and deeply appreciates the roles credible NGOs have been playing in different parts”, he added.
