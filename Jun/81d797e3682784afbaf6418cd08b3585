Cross River State has been hit by the scarcity of brooms. An investigation by DAILY POST around various markers found that brooms are now sold between N500 and N1000 respectively. A trip to Marian maker, Watt market, Mbukpa market and others in the state indicated a shortage of brooms as traders said they ”had no brooms in stock” The scarcity of brooms in the state may not be unconnected to the massive wave of defections to the APC which just hit the state. A sources from APC told our correspondent that the scarcity could be as a result of thousands of brooms taken to the central senatorial district for those defecting from the PDP to APC A broom dealer in the Marian market said, “This is the first time our business is moving. I have ordered for a thousand from Aiwa Ibom State for this weekend “If it continues, I have no regret doing this business, everything has time according to the scriptures and this is our time to smile. May God help us” he stated Confirming the scarcity, the Publicity Secretary of APC, Basset Ita said, “That scarcity of broom, which is APC’s symbol, has hit Cross River as millions of enthusiastic Cross Riverians continue to join the party in solidarity with the visionary and people-oriented governor. “To address the challenge, the party ordered three million bundles of brooms from local suppliers to meet the growing demand. “It is no longer news that the broom revolution has since hit our dear state following the defection of our amiable governor to our party, but what is now the news is that broom scarcity has hit Cross River following growing demand for it as millions of our people continue to identify with the party,” he told DAILY POST via phone on Monday
