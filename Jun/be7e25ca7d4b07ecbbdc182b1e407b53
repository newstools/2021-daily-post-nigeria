Real Madrid captain, Sergio Ramos, has made a u-turn and now wants to stay at Santiago Bernabeu, according to AS. Ramos had turned down several Real Madrid’s contract extensions this year, but the defender is now willing to remain at the club with a 10 per cent pay cut. Ramos’s future has been a talking point for much of the season. The 35-year-old has less than a month until he is a free agent.

The Spain international’s current contract expires June 30 and a breakdown in his relationship with club president, Florentino Perez, means that he will not extend his stay with the LaLiga giants. Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City have been linked with a move for the centre-back. Ramos is believed to earn an eye-watering £312,000-per-week, making him the top earner at Real Madrid. LaLiga: Messi made sure Real Madrid did not win more titles – Sergio Ramos
