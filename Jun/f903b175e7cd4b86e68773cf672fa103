Apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, on Thursday, said it has rejected calls from well-meaning Igbos to take over the Southeast Security Outfit, Ebubeagu. DAILY POST had reported that the chairman of the security network resigned from his position, alleging that the outfit was denied funding. In a statement made available to DAILY POST, signed by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, Secretary-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, he said there were no consultative meetings and the people’s approval of the outfit before its formation.
“The Southeast governors should be encouraged to sufficiently provide necessary logistics and reinstate the chairman of the Security Committee who resigned based on logistics’ deficiencies. Ebubeagu vs ESN: ‘Focus on the enemy, don’t be rivals’ – Ohanaeze calls for calm “Unlike the Amotekun, where the Southwest Governors provided adequate facilities and logistics, Ebubeage was built on emotional ground and sentiments,” he stated. The scribe added that Ohanaeze Ndigbo was not saddled with the Constitutional rights of protection of lives and properties in the Southeast. “We are independently funded through communal support of Ndigbo without any government consent, it will be horrible to heap the responsibility of Ebubeagu on us. “Southeast Governors are capable of providing logistics and we are in full support of them,” he noted.
