Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, on Saturday, insisted that the agreement reached by the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) with the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) was not binding on the Rivers government. Wike said it was regrettable that the NGF signed an agreement with the striking members of JUSUN, on behalf of State governments without discussing with the Rivers government on the competing subjects. According to him, the NGF was on its own, adding that the forum was not a government. The governor spoke at the inauguration of the Senate Building of the Rivers State University and the groundbreaking for the construction of the Faculty of College of Medical Sciences. Tell Buhari to take steps in stopping Nigeria from going to war – HURIWA tells govs Wike said: “Rivers State Government has implemented financial autonomy for the legislature and Judiciary. The Judiciary has collected the first and second quarters of their capital fund. “We still use our money to do infrastructure for them in spite of the fact that we gave them their capital expenditure. “Governors’ Forum is not a Government. It is an association of Governors to share ideas and not to sign agreements on behalf of State governments. “Even when they say something, I will have to come back to the state and call the State Executive Council meeting, and we will take it as our resolution that this is what we are going to do. So, whatever they have signed with JUSUN, let me tell you, people, it is not binding on the Rivers State government.” Imo: Nigerian Governors react to razing of Uzodinma’s home
