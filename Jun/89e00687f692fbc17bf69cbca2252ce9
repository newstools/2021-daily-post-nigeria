The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has expressed its worries about insecurity as it prepares for Anambra State governorship election slated for November 6, 2021. INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, expressed the concerns during a lecture at the 2021 annual Abubakar Momoh Memorial Lecture organised by The Election Institute (TEI). Yakubu said INEC was also worried about the on-going security challenges nationwide as there have been numerous attacks on the Commission’s offices and properties all over the country. “We are seriously concerned at the impact of this challenge when the physical registrations begin at the 2,673 Registration Centres soon. “We are also deeply concerned about the safety of electoral officers even more than we are about the security of our property and materials. “Also, we’ve expressed concerns about the Anambra governorship election that is scheduled for Nov. 6, especially following the attack on the head office in Anambra. “However, the Commission, in collaboration with all stakeholders is determined to tackle this challenge. “The Nigerian public must own the desire for democracy and peaceful conduct of elections,’’ he said. 42 INEC offices destroyed in two years – Presidency
