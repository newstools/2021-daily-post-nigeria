The Deputy Inspector General of Police, in charge of Operation Restore Peace in the South-South region, DIG Moses Jitoboh, on Wednesday, raised the alarm over the gathering of some members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Edo State with the intent of spreading secessionist messages across the state. He listed the areas they are currently holding their secret meetings in the State as Igbanke, Ubiaja, Iguelaba, Igueben, Okhiahe and Ologbo. Jitoboh disclosed this during a stakeholders meeting and the launching of Operation Restore Peace in the South-South region held in Benin City. DIG Jitoboh said Edo and Bayelsa are the states currently enjoying relative peace in the country and that they must not allow anybody to come in and scuttle it with secessionist messages. CAN hails Usman Alkali Baba’s appointment as acting IGP Jitoboh asked the people in the communities where the harbingers of secessionist are holding their various meetings to report same to the police for urgent attention, noting that it is better to nip them in the bud than allowing it to grow into something else in the state. He said his mission in the region was to restore peace, noting that President Muhammadu Buhari inaugurated what is called Operation Restore Peace in the troubled region (South-South and South-East) and that he is in charge of the South-South region.
