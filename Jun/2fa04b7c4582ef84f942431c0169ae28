The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo has accused the State Governor, Hope Uzodinma of allegedly being responsible for the series of extrajudicial killings in the state. The opposition party asked the governor to account for the killing of innocent civilians in the state. The Imo state PDP Chairman, Charles Ugwu made the allegations while briefing newsmen on Thursday. He alleged that the governor failed to address the security issues in the state because he was masterminding them. He regretted that prominent sons and daughters of Imo had been killed within a space of one month and the governor has done nothing about it.
