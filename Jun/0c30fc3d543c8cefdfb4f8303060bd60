UEFA has insisted it has no plans to replace Wembley as the stadium that will host the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020. This comes after Italian Prime Minister, Mario Draghi, called for the matches to be moved from the UK due to rising COVID-19 cases. There have also been rumours that UEFA could opt for Budapest, the capital of Hungary, if the UK government refuses to allow quarantine exemptions for visiting supporters and UEFA guests to attend the games. However, a UEFA spokesman said on Tuesday: “UEFA, the English FA and the English authorities are working closely together successfully to stage the semifinals and final of EURO in Wembley and there are no plans to change the venue for those games.” Wembley is scheduled to host the semi-finals on July 6 and 7 before the July 11 final.
