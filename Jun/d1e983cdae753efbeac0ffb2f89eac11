A former Governor of Kano State, Ibrahim Shekarau, has advised the All Progressives Congress (APC) to pick someone from the South as its presidential candidate in 2023. Shekarau made the call during an interview with the BBC Hausa Service in Kano on Wednesday. According to the serving Senator, political power shift is important for all Nigerians to have a sense of belonging. He said, “It is also the same with rotating the presidency between the North and South. “If we ignore power shifts, we’re not being fair to ourselves and we are not fair to history. “In my opinion, a power shift is necessary for all Nigerians to have a sense of belonging.” Shekarau however noted that although rotational presidency is not written in the APC’s constitution, it is desirable for justice and fairness. “For instance, the present six geopolitical zones are not reflected in Nigeria’s constitution, but it is a good arrangement. “You cannot implement any policy in Nigeria without taking geopolitical zones into consideration,” Shekarau added.
