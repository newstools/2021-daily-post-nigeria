The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo State, has accused Governor Hope Uzodinma of creating confusion in Imo town union leadership. The opposition party said the Governor had balkanized the leadership of town unions in the state by handpicking the leaders of his choice. The party made the accusation through its Director-General of New Media, Collins Opuruzor, during a phone-in program on Darling FM yesterday. According to him, “the leadership of the town unions are decided by the people and not the Governor. “Hand picking members of the town union executives is a rape of the traditional institution. It is wrong. “The Governor should allow the people to make the best-informed choice of their leaders at the town union level, instead of interfering and appointing the leaders by himself. Confusion in Osun SDP as factional chairman, secretary, others emerge “You see what we have been saying. When a government has no agenda for the people. You will agree with me that the APC-led government has destroyed almost all the system in the state. “Look at what is happening in Imo NUJ and its female wing, National Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ). The Governor has divided the council into two factions. “Now, he is inviting all the 27 LGAs for a town hall meeting at the Government House. Let me ask you, since when have town hall meetings started holding at the Government House, instead of communities? “The Governor should allow these independent bodies to function on their own and stop influencing them. He should allow the autonomy which they enjoy to continue because it’s their right. “The Governor should change some of his policies which are not for the interest of the people,” he said.
