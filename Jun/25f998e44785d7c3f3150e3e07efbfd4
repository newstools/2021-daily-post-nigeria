The Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) has provided reasons for the leaking of water at the National Assembly. Head of Public Relations, Richard Nduul, issued a statement in reaction to the incident many had described as an embarrassment. The federal legislature came under condemnation after video showed a flooded lobby. The Senate wing of the National Assembly was mostly affected as water gushed from the roof during the week.

The spokesman recalled that the NASS management approached the FCDA in 2019 for upgrading of the building. He said the proposed contract for the complex rehabilitation is undergoing due process in line with the Procurement Act of 2007. FCDA assured the contract would be awarded once it conforms with requirements of the Act and other relevant parameters. Leaking roof: Another way for NASS to embezzle money – Nigerians allege
