Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has declared that he has never insulted President Muhammadu Buhari despite a face-off with the presidency. In a 24-second video posted on his official Facebook page on Sunday morning, the governor said his criticism of the president over the security reality in his state was misconstrued by some Nigerians. According to him, he criticizes the president to ensure that his administration succeeds. He said, “Sometimes I talk about the presidency and at one point some ignorant people said that I was castigating President Muhammadu Buhari. “Some were so ridiculous to the extent of saying that I insult Mr President, I did not insult him. It is true that as a leader, I want him to succeed so I criticize”. DAILY POST reports that the Benue State Government and the presidency have several times engaged in face-off over alleged inability of President Buhari to tackle insecurity in the state.
