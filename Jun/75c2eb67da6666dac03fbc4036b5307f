The Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) has claimed their late founder, Prophet Temitope Balogun, prophesied his own death. Following the shock death of the 57-year-old six days to his birthday, SCOAN released a statement via their Facebook page. Joshua had earlier in the day participated in a church programme before his shocking death. The cause of his death is not yet official, but his remains have been deposited in the morgue. The statement released by SCOAN began with a citation from Amos 3:7, which reads: “Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets”. It then added that: “On Saturday 5th June 2021, Prophet TB Joshua spoke during the Emmanuel TV Partners Meeting: “Time for everything – time to come here for prayer and time to return home after the service.” “God has taken His servant Prophet TB Joshua home – as it should be by divine will. During his lifetime, Joshua earned a reputation for always predicting events in Nigeria and abroad. Earlier this week, the cleric had even called for Nigerians to fast and pray on June 12, his birthday.
