Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to President Mohammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, has said that some people were disappointed to have seen his principal ‘real life’ in interviews and broadcast last weekend. Shehu said this when he when asked during an interview with Nigerian Television Authority, NTA, whether Buhari’s interviews and speeches last week allayed the doubt of many people on whether he is in control of the government or not. After many months of confining himself to the Presidential Villa, Buhari featured in interviews aired on Arise TV and NTA and also visited Lagos State where he inaugurated some projects. The President also delivered a Democracy Day Speech on June 12. “Yes, he has always been (in control) but there has been misperception and propaganda “By his own personal style, President Buhari is not too forward and he has not been frontal on many aspects. It is certainly not a sign of lack of effectiveness or that one is not in charge. “People had yearned for him to speak to Nigerians and they have advocated for this including the national parliament, passing resolutions and there he was speaking as President Buhari, nothing artificial about him. According to Shehu, most Nigerians are satisfied and happy to having seen the president animated, real life, capable and exuding that confidence and capability to govern well. He added that the President’s last week’s activities “obviously would have disappointed some people, who in their view, nothing good can come out of an administration in which they are not a part of.”
