Coach of the France national team, Didier Deschamps, has hit back at Jose Mourinho after the Portuguese claimed it would be a failure if Les Bleus don’t win the European Championship this summer. France are looking to become the first side since Spain (2008-2012) to win back-to-back tournaments. Deschamps’ men can also replicate the France team who achieved it from 1998-2000. Mourinho said: “They have to win it. If not, it is an unsuccessful Euros.” Euro 2020: Wenger snubs England, predicts country to win tournament When Deschamps was asked to respond to Mourinho’s comments on Telefoot, he replied: “I thought the same thing about his Tottenham team, but it did not end up happening like that. “Yes, we are favourites due to the status of world champions. It is not a pressure, it is the reality, we will not flee the debate on the presence of France among the favourites of this Euro.” Mourinho was fired by Spurs in April after 17 months in charge, but has signed a three-year deal with Roma to begin the 2020/2021 season.
