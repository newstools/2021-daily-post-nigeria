Twitter has deleted the video of President Muhammadu Buhari, threatening to deal with those who want to destroy his government. Recall that Twitter had on Wednesday deleted the tweet for violating its rules. Nigerians had called for the suspension of Buhariâ€™s account for saying individuals or groups who want to destroy his government will receive the shock of their lives. He had said they will be treated in a language they will understand. However, barely 24-hours after Lai Mohamed accused Twitter of meddling in the political affairs of the country, Twitter has now taken down the video of the threat. The Minister had accused Twitter of conveniently ignoring inciting tweets by the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, and the ENDSARS protest, where government and private properties were looted and set on fire, all in the name of right to protest. He maintained that Buhari has the right to express himself. The video was initially posted on the official handle of the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, @NGRPresident, but a check by DAILY POST shows that the video has been taken down. It was taken down for violating Twitter rules.
