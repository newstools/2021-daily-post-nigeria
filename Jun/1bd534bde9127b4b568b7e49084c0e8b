Roma manager, Jose Mourinho, has said England will defeat Scotland in their Euro 2020 group game on Friday. According to the former Chelsea and Manchester United boss, it would take a “miracle” for Steve Clarke’s team to win. The two rivals clash in a Group D match and if the Three Lions are victorious, they will qualify for the last 16 with a game to spare, following their 1-0 victory over Croatia in the group opener.

Mourinho wrote for The Sun: “They [Scotland] are super-motivated and they have that Braveheart spirit but in football it’s very, very rare that miracles happen. “When I say miracles, I mean a team overcoming a huge difference in quality. “Can Scotland go to Wembley and win? Yes, because it’s one football match — but no, because England are a much better team with much better players.” Euro 2020: England suffers major setback as key player pulls out of squad
