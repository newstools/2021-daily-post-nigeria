President Muhammadu Buhari has hailed the election of Iran’s new president Ebrahim Raisi. The President said it reinforces the centrality of the will of the people to the success of democracy anywhere in the world. Buhari, in a statement on Monday, said Raisi deserved his victory in the presidential election. The Nigerian leader stressed that democracy affords voters the opportunity to change or re-elect their representatives by peaceful means. He described Raisi as “a consummate politician with experience to lead his country to greater heights and a better future”. Buhari urged Iranians to shun political differences and support the winner to succeed in efforts to overcome the impact of COVID-19 and crippling sanctions. He advised the President-elect to unite Iran for the sake of protecting the common interests of Iranians that transcend party lines. Buhari prayed that God guides and grants Raisi wisdom in the discharge of his responsibilities.
