The Ogun State Police Command on Friday gunned down a herdsman while reportedly kidnapping a tipper driver at Mologede in Abeokuta, Odeda Local Government Area of the state. DAILY POST learnt that DSP Durojaiye Rotimi, the DPO of Bode Olude Divisional Headquarters, had received a distress call at noon that the tipper driver was being “kidnapped by a group of people suspected to be herdsmen.” Consequently, he was said to have mobilized his men, local hunters, men of the Ogun So-Safe Corps and officers from adjoining divisions to the area. As they were combing the bush, the team sighted the kidnappers, who engaged them in a gun duel. “In the process, one of the kidnappers was shot in the leg, while others escaped with various degrees of gunshot injuries, while the victim was rescued unhurt,” Ogun police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST on Saturday. Oyeyemi said a single-barrelled gun was recovered, adding that the shot suspect died on the way to the hospital. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, has ordered a manhunt for the fleeing members of the gang. Two gunned to death in rival cult clash in Awka
