Senator Shehu Sani, who represented Kaduna Central at the 8th National Assembly, has slammed the Northern groups who placed a bounty on Kanu’s whereabouts. DAILY POST had reported that 17 Northern groups under the aegis of Northern Consensus Movement (NCM) on Thursday declared Kanu wanted over the killings and destruction of properties owned by Northerners in the Southeast. The President of the group, Dr Auwal Abdullahi, while addressing a press conference, also placed a N100m bounty on Kanu. Reacting, Senator Sani faulted the move, stating that the group should have channeled their efforts towards ending the terrorism and banditry currently ravaging their region. The former lawmaker made the remark on Friday in a post on his official Facebook page. “We have terrorists and bandits here up north, killing and kidnapping our people; why not the Northern groups place a price tag on the heads of their leaders instead of placing them on someone far abroad,” he said.
