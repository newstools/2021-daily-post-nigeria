Today, this is another display of our exploits within the month under review. “It’s all so loathsome, so degenerating that some criminally-minded individuals still perceive Ondo State as a place that they can conveniently trade in criminality without being apprehended. “I have tried to make criminals know that I am not in Ondo State for the comfort of its sunshine beauty but to decimate all awful acts of criminality in and around the state. “For those criminals who have refused to leave Ondo State while I supervise the security architecture of the state, I have this warning for them. “No criminal should hope that he can match the ardour or the professional ability of my men when it comes to fighting crimes and criminality,” Salami said.
