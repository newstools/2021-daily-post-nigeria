Deji Adeyanju, an Abuja-based rights activist, has hinted that two more governors on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) may defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Adeyanju alleged that the APC are currently in talks with the governors. In a tweet, the Convener of Concerned Nigerian said the talks are part of a move to get the governors into defecting to APC before the party’s state congresses. Adeyanju wrote: “Zamfara Governor has defected to APC like I said. APC is still talking to two PDP Governors to see if they can defect before their state congresses so they handover the party structures to them. I feel so much pity for Yari.” Recall that Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle had dumped the PDP for APC. Matawalle’s defection was disclosed over the weekend by President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad. Ahmad had made this public via his verified Facebook page on Sunday morning.
