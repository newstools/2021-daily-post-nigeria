Edo State Police Command, on Monday, said the advice from the State’s Director of Public Prosecution, DPP, would determine the fate of Abubakar, a 13-year-old boy, who hacked his father, 79-year-old Osariakhi Oronsaye, to death on Sunday. The Command Public Relations Officer, SP Bello Kontongs, disclosed this to newsmen in Benin city, the state capital. He said the septuagenarian was killed by his son at Egbon Estate in Evbuotubu axis on a day the entire world was celebrating Fathers Day. Kontongs noted that the minor status of the offenders had made it imperative for the Command to liaise with the DPP, noting that everything would be done to unravel the case. “I can confirm to you that the command is discussing the case with the DPP. It is an unfortunate case but we are also conducting our investigation to ensure that we unravel the case. The culprit is a minor so we must be sure of what we are doing. It was gathered that late Oronsaye had earlier reported his son to the Evbuotubu Police Station a week ago when the boy threatened to kill him, but upon arrest, the father had a change of mind and pleaded with the police to let the son go. The young boy carried out his threat as he allegedly axed his father to death in his sleep in the early hours of Sunday.
