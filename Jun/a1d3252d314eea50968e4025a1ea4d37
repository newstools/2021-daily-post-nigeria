The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, OYC, on Monday warned against what it called another onslaught against the Charismatic Enugu Priest, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka of the Adoration Ministry, Enugu Nigeria. DAILY POST had reported that the priest during his programme on Sunday at the Adoration ground raised the alarm over an invitation from the DSS, asking him to report to Abuja. Reacting through a statement from the OYC President-General, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, the Igbo group said it would not condone further harassment of the priest. “I condemn the invitation because it is a plan by the Federal Government to silence Fr. Mbaka; whoever speaks without supporting the government they now come for the person, just like it banned Twitter. “DSS has no reason to invite Mbaka. The same Mbaka prophesied the emergence of Buhari, he was not invited by DSS then, but now that he is talking about the state of the nation, hunger and killings in the land, DSS came to invite him. Mbaka: Don’t truncate peace in Enugu – Ohanaeze warns “But we warn that any plot against Mbaka must be resisted by Igbo youths, let nothing happen to him. This onslaught against a revered priest in Igbo land should stop forthwith” He also attacked the Catholic Bishop of the Enugu Diocese, Bishop Calistus Onaga. “The Bishop should cease from trying to silence Mbaka. Mbaka has been talking under two past Bishops- Eneja and Gbuji, they did not disturb him. We are in the know that the FG is on the neck of Onaga to silence Mbaka. “They want Mbaka banned and sent out of the Catholic Church. But they must know that the physical cannot control the spiritual. “Mbaka should continue to prophesy to the world, those who don’t have such a gift are just envious of him,” he added. Those after Fr. Mbaka have not given up – Ohanaeze youths claim
