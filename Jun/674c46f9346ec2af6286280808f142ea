Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho has been offered a £250,000-a-week contract by Manchester United, the UK Telegraph reports. Sancho is expected to join Man United in a deal that will be worth at least £77.4million. Man United are finally expected to ‘formally agree’ the transfer of Sancho from Dortmund this week. The report added that Dortmund are now eyeing Tottenham Hotspur academy graduate and PSV star, Noni Madueke, as one of their main targets to replace Sancho. Sancho is currently at the ongoing Euro 2020 with the England national team. The 21-year-old will hope to feature for England when they tackle Germany in the last-16 on Tuesday.
