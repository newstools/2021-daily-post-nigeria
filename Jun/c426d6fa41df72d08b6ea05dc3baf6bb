Nigeria is collaborating with the United Nations (UN) to improve food systems in the country. The federal government said the partnership is in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s agenda to lift 100 million Nigerians from poverty within a decade. The effort is to attack the menace of hunger, combat malnutrition, reduce poor diet-related diseases among others. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Tuesday made a presentation at a Consolidatory Dialogue for the UN Food Systems Summit held in Abuja. In attendance were Governors, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, cabinet members, Nigeria’s development partners, the academia, and private and public sector players. The VP said aside from the goal of realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and guaranteeing food security for a growing population, the sustainable food systems effort fits into the Buhari administration plan. Osinbajo noted that for government of Nigeria, the commitment to sustainable food systems is one of the key strategies for eliminating poverty. “We know that our target of lifting a hundred million Nigerians out of poverty within a decade is only achievable if we focus on substantially improving agriculture and food systems which assure us of not just good food, but also jobs”, he added.
