Former Chelsea manager, Jose Mourinho, believes ‘every’ position on the pitch is best for Mason Mount in manager Thomas Tuchel’s squad because he is a creative player. Mourinho said this prior to England’s Euro 2020 final warm-up game against Romania on Sunday evening. The Three Lions eventually won the game 1-0 against Romania, thanks to Marcus Rashford’s penalty. The Portuguese, who is now the manager of Roma, believes Mount was given ‘incredible conditions’ to thrive by former Chelsea coach, Frank Lampard. Chelsea’s Mason Mount names best team in the world When asked to name Mount’s best position in the Chelsea squad, Mourinho told The Times: “Everywhere. I’ve to be honest, I watched him two seasons ago in his first [Premier League] match, Manchester United against Chelsea at Old Trafford, and I saw the talent but I did not see maturity or consistency. “I put a little bit of a question mark over how long this boy would need to develop and become a complete player. He did not need long. “I think he has to thank Frank because even with results not being wonderful, he was always keeping faith in that kid. He gave him incredible conditions to develop. “I believe he’s an attack-minded player, a creative player, but he has the tactical discipline.

We see him now with Tuchel coming from the sides, when with Frank [Lampard], he was more of a number 10. When they play with a back five, he can be the third attacking player or the third midfield player. “I think he is very, very intelligent on the pitch. From what I see, he has a very good understanding of the game. “He has goals, which is an important thing for a midfield player. I like him very much.” Champions League: Mount makes history as Chelsea eliminates Real Madrid
