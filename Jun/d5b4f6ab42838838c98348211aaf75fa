Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation, has called on the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to unmask those that were involved in the death of former Head of State, Gen. Sani Abacha and M.K.O Abiola. The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP chieftain also said that such individuals, no matter how highly placed, must be brought to book. According to Fani-Kayode, as Nigerians are celebrating the immortalisation of M.K.O Abiola, the adjudged winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, they should also be demanding arrest and prosecution of his killers. “We are celebrating & immortalising MKO Abiola but we are not demanding for the unmasking, arrest & prosecution of those who murdered him,” the politician tweeted. “We know that Susan Rice, who was then @BillClinton’s Under-Sec. of State for Africa& later @BarackObama’s NSA served him the poisoned tea. “I hereby call on the Buhari administration to open a formal investigation into the murder of MKO Abiola &, no matter how highly placed, to prosecute & bring to justice ANYONE that was involved. “I also call on them to ummask & prosecute those who murdered Gen. Sani Abacha.”
