The Police Command in Oyo State, on Monday, paraded three men arrested in connection with Iwo Road clash between officials of state Park Management System (PMS) and phone traders in the area. Recall that the clash between the park managers and the phone sellers claimed two lives on Wednesday at Iwo road area of Ibadan. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Ngozi Onadeko, while briefing newsmen on Monday at the command’s Headquarters in Ibadan, said that the suspects were linked with the Iwo road crisis. “We are parading these suspects for their involvement in the crisis that happened in Iwo road last week Wednesday. “These three people were arrested and paraded due to their involvement in the crisis that happened on Wednesday at Iwo road. “Though, investigation is still ongoing, I will continue to update you about what we get from the investigation, and that is basically what is going on now,” Onadeko said. Speaking about the incessant killings in Ibadan and the command’s efforts in curbing it, Onadeko said that more tactical teams and policemen have been drafted to ensure safety of residents of the state. She pleaded for the support of the public in providing credible information that would assist the police in discharging its duty, saying the perpetrators lived with the citizens in the community. “We are still having these incessant attacks on Okada riders, and we have continued to put more policemen on the road. “We are doing more than enough for police visibility and intelligent gathering, we need the support of the public,” Onadeko said.
