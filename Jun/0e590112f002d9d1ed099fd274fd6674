The Biafra Nations League, BNL, has faulted Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State for threatening the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. BNL said Wike was a shameless talkative who would “run into the bush when situation gets out of hand in the state.” DAILY POST had reported that the governor had said IPOB members allegedly threatening the peace of the state would soon meet their “funeral”. Wike had issued the threat on Tuesday during the commissioning of construction work at the Ahoada Campus of the Rivers State University and the dualization of the Ahoada-Omoku Road in Ahoada Town. Reacting, BNL dismissed the threats by Wike to kill and bury anyone associated with Biafra, particularly IPOB members in the state. The group stated this in a statement jointly signed by its Deputy National Leader, and Head of Operations, Ebuta Takon and Chief Head of Operations of BNL, Henry Edet. Biafra: How Gov Wike forced Ben Ayade out of PDP – BNL BNL said the Governor himself is not safe, adding that “people above his calibre in Nigeria and outside Nigeria have been assassinated despite their security backup.” The group described the “Rivers State Governor as a shameless talkative who didn’t take action other than his frequent declaration of curfew in the state.” Takon urged their members and supporters in the State not to be frightened by the threat. “Any Governor who wants to kill his people over a cause will be haunted down no matter the kind of security men with him,” the statement added.
