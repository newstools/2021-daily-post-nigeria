Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) forward, Kylian Mbappe, is set to leave the club after losing faith in the project in Paris, RMC Sport reports. The France international wants to leave PSG as he prepares to enter the final year of his contract with the Paris club. The 22-year-old has lost belief in the project of PSG sporting director, Leonardo, and will depart the club on a free transfer next summer if he doesn’t go sooner. Mbappe scored 42 goals in 47 games in all competitions for PSG last season, but Mauricio Pochettino’s men surrendered the French Ligue 1 title to Lille. PSG were also knocked out by Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals. Meanwhile, Mbappe has drawn the interest of Real Madrid and Liverpool in the past. Speaking on Mbappe’s future, PSG president, Nasser El-Khelaifi, recently told L’Equipe: “I am going to be clear: Kylian [Mbappe] will stay in Paris, we are never going to sell him, and he will never leave on a free transfer.” Mbappe reveals why he snubbed Real Madrid move
