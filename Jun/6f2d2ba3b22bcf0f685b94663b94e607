The District Head of the ancient city of Zungeru in Wushishi Local Government area, of Niger State, Mallam Mustapha Madaki, (Madakin Zungeru), and his two wives have allegedly been abducted by armed bandits. It was learnt the community leader and his two wives were taken to an unknown location. DAILY POST gathered that gunmen numbering about 20, arrived Zungeru at about 1:40am on Sunday and headed to the house of the Madakin Zungeru which is located in the heart of the town. They were said to have captured him from the room of one of the wives, Habiba and carried him away alongside his two wives. A source from the area told our Reporter that the bandits arrived in the area and went straight to the Madaki’s house and carried only him and his wives. The source explained, “the attack from what we saw was carried out through an informant as it was only the district head and his wives that were abducted from the town in an operation that lasted only 30 minutes without any resistance from anywhere” “The gunmen parked their motorcycles about 500 meters away and walked on foot into Zungeru to attack the town.” It was also gathered that the bandits have not contacted the relations of the victims. DAILY POST gathered that before the attack on Sunday, all expatriates working on the 700 Megawatt Zungeru hydro dam, Messrs CNEEC-Sino hydro abandoned the site. They were allegedly escorted out of the state under heavy security on Saturday morning. Zungeru town is about 30 kilometres from Tegina, where the 136 pupils of Salihu Tanko Islamic school were abducted last Sunday. Efforts to get a reaction from the State Police Command failed as the Public Relations Officer, PRO, DSP Wasiu Abiodun could not be reached as of press time.
