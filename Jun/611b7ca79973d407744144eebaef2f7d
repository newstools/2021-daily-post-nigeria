Controversial crossdresser, Idris Okuneye, who is more popular as Bobrisky, has cried out over the side effects of the cosmetic surgery he allegedly underwent recently. The 28-year-old claimed he would be undergoing the procedure to help him have a more feminine body. However, Bobrisky has now said he “wants his life back”, as he has been sleeping in one position for days. According to him, “the pain is out of this world”. He wrote on Snapchat: “I’m sorry I have been off here lately!!! I’m in pain… 360 lipo is damn painful. I want my life back. My stomach is so hurt. My back is gone. I can’t hold the (sic) no more. “The worst of all is sleeping in one position all day… “Thanks to my house girl (Rita) for always rubbing my back at night. I love you for supporting me with this journey. I thought I was dying. The pain is out of this world.”
