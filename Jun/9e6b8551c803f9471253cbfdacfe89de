The presidency has accused some Nigerians of celebrating the insecurity currently ravaging many parts of the country. Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina in this week’s edition of Fridays With Adesina, slammed Nigerians for allegedly rejoicing whenever an attack is launched in any part of the country. Adesina, who likened Nigerians to a song by Michael Jackson about the man in the mirror, “I’m starting with the man in the mirror, I’m asking him to change his ways”, urged Nigerians to change their perception of the present government and mend their ways. Boko Haram: Shekau has many lives, stop rejoicing – Biafra group mocks Adamu Garba, others According to him, those celebrating the challenges of the country failed to talk about the achievement of the president’s administration. The presidential spokesman said, “You rejoice when Boko Haram kills our troops. You are the man in the mirror. You exult when bandits carry away students into captivity. You are the man in the mirror. You dance when bombs and explosives go off, killing innocent souls. You are the man in the mirror”. He called on Nigerians to emulate the Cross River Governor, Ben Ayade who, according to him, dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for the betterment of the entire nation.
