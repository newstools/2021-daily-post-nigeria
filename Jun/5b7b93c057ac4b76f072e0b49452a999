The All Progressives Congress (APC) has rejected the allegation of planned rigging in 2023 made by National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus. The party said its track record in implementing projects and programmes that meet the needs of Nigerians is attracting their trust, more members and supporters. John Akpan Udoedehe, the National Secretary in a statement said the APC observes strong internal democracy, transparency and fairness in the conduct of its affairs which PDP lacks. The scribe noted that the APC was a better option for Nigerians, including serving Governors, National and State Assembly members who are abandoning the PDP. “We want to remind Nigerians that while many APC members were victims of rigging when the PDP was in power, the APC has no record of rigging elections. “The Muhammadu Buhari-led administation has introduced electoral reforms aimed at ensuring that all loopholes that open the electoral process to possible abuse in future elections are sealed and eliminated.” Udoedehe said with more than 40 million registered members, the APC can contest and win elections without tampering with the verdict of the citizens “as was the case when PDP misruled the country for 16 years”. He added that the PDP is doomed to fail in any future polls because it is rudderless, leaderless and devoid of anything coherent and organisational.
