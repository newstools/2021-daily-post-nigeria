Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has insisted that captain Harry Maguire shouldn’t be in England’s Euro 2020 squad. Ferdinand believes England manager, Gareth Southgate, made a mistake by selecting Maguire in his Euro 2020 squad. Southgate released his 26-man squad for Euro 2020 on Tuesday afternoon and included Maguire in the list despite his recent injury problems. Maguire missed Man United’s final five matches of the 2020/21 season, including their Europa League final defeat to Villarreal due to ankle ligament damage. “England needed another centre back. This tells me he [Southgate] is definitely playing three at the back,” Ferdinand told FIVE. “Harry Maguire’s not even fit, I wouldn’t even take Maguire. You are not fit, you are not going to be fit for ages, it doesn’t make sense. “I have been in squads with players who have not been fit and they don’t perform when they are not themselves.

As good as Maguire is, he’s not a Becks or a Wazza. “I don’t think you should take someone who’s not 100% fit. It’s hard to come back and get into a rhythm.” England will play Austria on June 2 and Romania on June 6 in warm-up friendly matches, before kicking off their tournament against Croatia on June 13. The Euro 2020 will kick off on June 11 – 11 July, 2021. Man Utd vs Liverpool: Solskjaer confirms player who is out of season
