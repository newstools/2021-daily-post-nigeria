Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho, will become the second-highest earning player at Manchester United if he completes a transfer this summer. United are still on Sancho, after being rebuffed in their attempts 12 months ago. The two clubs remain at loggerheads over a fee for the England international and the Red Devils have seen a £67million bid rejected on Thursday.

According to the Guardian, the 21-year-old is set to be handed a five-year deal worth around £350,000-a-week. In doing so, the England international would become the second-highest earner at the club, just shy of goalkeeper David de Gea’s £375,000-a-week deal. He will also move into the top five highest earners in the English top flight – joining De Gea, Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (£350,000) and Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling (£300,000). Sterling’s team-mate Kevin De Bruyne rounds off this list having signed improved terms on his old £300,000-a-week deal back in April.
