Ex-Nigeria international, Daniel Amokachi, has told Everton to consider appointing Duncan Ferguson as their new manager, after Carlo Ancelotti returned to Real Madrid. Ferguson, 49, has been developing his coaching skills since 2014 and was handed an interim role as the first-team coach after Marco Silva was sacked in December 2019.

My take, hopefully, someone is listening,” Amokachi wrote on Instagram. Mourinho rejected Real Madrid return before Ancelotti’s reappointment – Report
