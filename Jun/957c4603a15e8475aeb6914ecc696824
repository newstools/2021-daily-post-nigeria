Security operatives have been deployed in Awka, Anambra State capital, today over the conduct of the primary election of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). The heavy deployment is reportedly in response to the formation of another faction of the party, which, led by Jude Okeke, announced a separate date for the party’s primary. Meanwhile, journalists have been barred from entering the venue of the exercise, casting doubt about what the party plans to do, within the conduct of the process. The primary election started with accreditation at the Alex Ekwueme Square before delegates were moved to Dora Akunyili Women Development Centre, Awka for the primary election proper. The state Secretary of the party, Barr Tony Ifeanya, who spoke with our correspondent denied knowledge of any order by the leadership of the party to bar journalists. He stated that journalists in the state did not apply to the party for permission to cover the primary election, hence the denial of entry into the venue. “Maybe you people can wait around, when the process is over, the leadership of the party would speak to you about the outcome of the exercise,” he said.
