The Director of the Project Hope Alive (PHA), Mrs. Jennifer Okereke, has called on governments across Africa to protect the rights of African children and various domestic international treaties that would hasten the implementation of an agenda that makes them live well before 2040. As part of the campaign to commemorate the 2021 Day of the African Child with the theme: “Accelerate the implementation of Agenda 2040 for an Africa fit for children”, the NGO took the Child’s Right Campaign to LGEA primary school, Aleyita along Airport road in Abuja Municipal Area Council on Wednesday. Mrs Okereke said the fate of children lies in their protective rights but lamented that much was not done to inculcate their rights into them. She said: “The hope of every country is in the children because they are the generation that will maintain continuity. “The lives of the children must be protected and the government must wake up to the task of child’s right protection.” Speaking earlier, a guest who taught the school children on their rights, Mohammed Basah urged the children to report and speak out against any abuse against them by adults. Basah said Children have the right to life; education; right to dignity and thinking, he asked the children to respect the law of Nigeria as they grow in life. The school children came out in their numbers with their teachers even as a quiz competition was organised for them. NGO’s engaged in abortion services banned from receiving US funding
