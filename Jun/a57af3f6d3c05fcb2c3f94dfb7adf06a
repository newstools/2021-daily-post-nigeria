England manager, Gareth Southgate, has provided the latest injury update on Jordan Henderson and Harry Maguire ahead of their international friendly tie with Romania on Sunday evening at Riverside Stadium. Southgate said he expects Henderson to feature in England’s final warm-up friendly against Romania, while Maguire will be available for the Three Lions during Euro 2020. Henderson and Maguire have been two major injury concerns for England, with neither featuring for their clubs at the end of the 2020/2021 campaign. “The plan, as it was on Wednesday, is that he [Henderson] will be involved in the [Romania] game,” Southgate said at his pre-match press conference.
