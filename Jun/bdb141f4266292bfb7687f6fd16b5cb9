Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have abducted four people in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The four people were kidnapped Wednesday morning along the Ibadan-Ijebu-Ode Roa, DAILY POST reports. They were coming from Ijebu-Ode when they were whisked away by the gunmen. Our correspondent gathered that the abduction is coming few days after the wife of the All Progressives Congress (APC) youth leader, Mrs. Arikeade Oni-Salawu, regained freedom from her abductors. Our correspondent further gathered that families of the kidnapped victims went to some radio stations to protest the kidnap of their kinsmen. They were at Lagelu 96.7 FM Ibadan and Fresh 105.9 FM Ibadan to call the attention of security agencies. DAILY POST learnt that three of the victims had regained their freedom a few hours after the families staged the protest. It was gathered that the three lucky persons sustained varying degrees of injuries. However, the whereabouts of the fourth person has not been ascertained at the time of filing this report on Wednesday night. A family member, who spoke on the radio station said, “Three out of them have sustained injuries and they are now receiving treatment. One of them is still with them. They stopped them while returning to Ibadan from Ijebu Ode this morning. Gunmen strike again in Ibadan, abduct female soldier, two others
“The only man in their custody is the bread winner of the family. He must not be killed. Makinde should help us intervene now before it is too late.” All efforts made by DAILY POST to get a reaction from Public Relations Officer of the State Police Command, Mr Adewale Osifeso, proved abortive.
