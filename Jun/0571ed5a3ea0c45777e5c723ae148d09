Top commanders of Boko Haram and the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) has agreed to work together in a jihad following a recent peace pact between the two groups. The negotiation occurred one month after Abubakar Shekau, former Boko Haram blew up himself during a violent confrontation with ISWAP. The terrorists united in a 13-minute video obtained by PRNigeria. They placed their hands atop one another while making friendly comments. They pledged allegiance to Aba Ibrahim Al-Hashimiyil Khuraishi, who was unanimously ordained as ‘Khalifan Muslimai’ (The Leader of all Muslims). Four commanders from Boko Haram and ISWAP announced their loyalty. They spoke in Arabic, Hausa, English and Fulfulde. One of them, in his remarks, confirmed Nigeria intelligence services played a major role in creating divisions in their camps. Another thanked Khuraishi for the pact and said members of the sects should be happy about the reunion. An ISWAP fighter, with a rifle on his neck, declared: “What is left now is Jihad. We will not stop fighting the unbelievers. All the disbelievers have entered trouble.” ‘You’ll be hunted, punished’ – Nnamdi Kanu threatens Army Commanders, policemen
