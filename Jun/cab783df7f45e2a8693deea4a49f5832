The theme for this year is ‘SHARE THE FACTS ON DRUG AND SAVE LIVES’. “This theme highlights the notion and misinformation that has been going on about drugs and the need to share the facts and save lives. During this period we also look at our activities from the last celebration to date,” he said. NDLEA arrests 231 drug suspects in Oyo
