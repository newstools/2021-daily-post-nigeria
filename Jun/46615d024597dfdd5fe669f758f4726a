The ancient town of Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State, was taken over by flood after a heavy downpour that lasted several hours between Sunday and Monday. DAILY POST reports that some residents of the Olorunsogo and Ayesan areas of the city had their valuables destroyed. Some major streets were covered with water, submerging vehicles and other belongings.

The Special Adviser to the Governor on Environment, Ola Oresanya, and his Ministry of Works and Infrastructure counterpart, Akeem Adesina, spoke when they jointly led a state government delegation on an on-the-spot assessment of the flood situation in Olorunsogo community. Oresanya said the delegation was in the community to assess the situation, expressing the governmentâ€™s commitment to resolve the erosion problems in Ijebu Ode, which he confirmed had contributed to the flooding of some parts of the town. He said investigations had, however, revealed that the recent flash-flood experienced in the area is a perennial occurrence and cannot be attributed to the ongoing road construction works in the community. Oresanya blamed the residents for not adhering to the town planning laws and building houses on wetland and flood plains. He, therefore, urged the residents to begin to live with the risk, and immediately commence construction of drainage channels in front of their houses while awaiting the government holistic plan to solve the problem permanently.
