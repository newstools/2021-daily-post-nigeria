Barely three days after President Muhammadu Buhari revealed that he sent back two Southwest governors who visited him over farmers/herders clashes, Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has once again visited the Aso Rock Villa in Abuja. This time, Abiodun was in Abuja on a working visit to the President, as he showed him photos of his projects. In pictures made available to DAILY POST, Gov Abiodun was seen as he showed the pictures to President Buhari. Abiodun was in the villa with one of his aides, Hon. Tunji Egbetokun, on Sunday.  He said, “This evening, I met with President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR at the Aso Rock Villa in Abuja, intimating the President of the many developmental strides across our State. “During the visit in company with my Senior Special Adviser on Political Affairs, Rt. Hon. Tunji Egbetokun, I also showed Mr President the level of work done on a number of our projects in commerce, infrastructure, security and housing amongst numerous others.”  This will be the second time Gov Abiodun will be taking photos of his achievements to Buhari in Aso Rock. DAILY POST reports that Gov Abiodun visited Buhari in February, a time Ogun residents in Yewa were being killed by fiendish herdsmen. But Buhari, during an interview with Arise TV said, “Recently, two governors from the Southwest came to tell me that the cattle rearers in some of the forests there have killed the farmers while the cattle were eating up their crops. “But I told them, you campaigned to be elected and you were elected. So, I said go back and sort yourselves.” The President did not mention who the two Southwest governors are.
