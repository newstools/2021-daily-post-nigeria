Former Manchester United boss, Sir Alex Ferguson, has given his verdict on the club’s transfer target, Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho. Man United and Dortmund are stepping up talks over Sancho, with the German club having reduced their asking price to £77 million. Both clubs are optimistic that a deal will be completed and the 21-year-old has already verbally agreed to personal terms with the Red Devils. Manchester United spent most of last summer trying to prise the England international away from Dortmund, but the Bundesliga giants refused to budge on their €120m (£103m) asking price. Twelve months later and Sancho is once again Manchester United’s top target, though this time there is growing confidence a deal will be agreed before the end of Euro 2020. “I think a lot about Jadon Sancho. With his one-on-one duels, as an assister and scorer, he is extremely dangerous,” Ferguson told SportBild. “He has so much potential, he helps the team. That is why he will be valuable to England over the course of the tournament [Euro 2020].”
