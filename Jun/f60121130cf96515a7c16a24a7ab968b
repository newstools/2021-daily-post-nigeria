Nollywood actress, Mercy Aigbe and her ex-husband, Lanre Gentry have been fighting dirty via social media and it seems to be getting really messy. The drama all started when Mercy Aigbe celebrated herself on Father’s Day without acknowledging the role of a father figure in the lives of her children. Lanre, reacting, denied being an absentee dad, adding that he has been responsible for his children. Mercy fired back, calling him a shameless man and threatening to release evidence showing he has not been performing his fatherly role and now Lanre has also counter-attacked. Lanre responding again on his Instagram page, threatened to expose secrets of the actress, accusing her of ‘prostitution and living a fake life on social media.’ His post read: Mercy Aigbe, it does not take me a minute to expose all your shady secrets callous inhuman and prostitution acts with all your so call marketer, but I will not, because of my son Olajuwon and your very good mother. “But when the time comes the whole world will still know the fake life you are living and you need to stop all this your arrogant life.”
