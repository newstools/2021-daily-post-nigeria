The Federal Government has lamented that Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, is using Twitter to destabilize Nigeria. Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, disclosed this at an interview with BBC News Africa. Mohammed noted that Kanu uses Twitter to direct members of IPOB to attack policemen, soldiers, correctional centres and offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. The minister lamented that Twitter has failed to sanction the IPOB leader for using the platform to destabilize Nigeria. Nigerians mock Buhari govt for announcing suspension of Twitter via Twitter Lai Mohammed said, “IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu in particular, his platform of choice to destabilise the country is Twitter. “Twitter is actually the platform of choice for the separatist leader who resides outside Nigeria but issues directives for his members to attack the symbols of authority such as policemen, soldiers, correctional centres, electoral offices. “This has been done willfully and consistently without consequences using always the Twitter platform.” The Minister had last week disclosed the ban on Twitter in Nigeria.
