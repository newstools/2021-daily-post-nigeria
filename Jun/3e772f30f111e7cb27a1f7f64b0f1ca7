Spiritual Leader, the Brotherhood of the Cross and Star, Olumba Olumba Obu has insisted that Nigeria can never be divided and that agitators are doomed. He said all those fanning embers of secession, plotting to take over the government and sponsoring killings are doomed and will be arrested. Olumba Obu told a large crowd of faithful that the country will not be divided and cautioned groups of persons or individuals agitating for the break up of Nigeria to desist, stressing that they can never succeed. He said Nigeria is God’s own country, emphasising that all those threatening her existence have been arrested by spiritual forces. “Nigeria is God’s own country. Nigeria can not be divided. Whether they like it or not, Nigeria belongs to God. All those fanning embers of division, sponsoring killings and threatening her existence are doomed. “Now you are trying to take over power. Those engaging themselves to take over the administration, or attempting to separate her are in trouble. “When He created this country, where were all those agitating for her break up? They will never succeed.” He urged political, religious leaders and individual Nigerians, irrespective of tribe, to talk peace, unity, adding that if they display love towards one another, Nigeria would be very great.
