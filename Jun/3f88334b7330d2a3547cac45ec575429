Yiaga Africa on Saturday frowned at the suspension of Twitter by the federal government and the directive that all Over-The-Top, OTT, services must be licensed by the National Broadcasting Commission, NBC, before they can operate within Nigeria. While stating that the development portends great threat to the freedom of speech and expression, the organization urged the federal government to reverse the decision Yiaga Africa in a statement issued by its Director of Programmes, Cynthia Mbamalu, disclosed that Nigeria ought to follow the footsteps of countries making judicious use of social media space instead of imposing a ban on a platform where citizens engage in public conversation and civic engagement. According to the microblogging platform, the suspension of Twitter is antithetical to democracy principles. It further stated that the platform had emerged as a veritable space where citizens express their opinions and as questions and demand accountability from their leaders. The organisation added that democracy cannot thrive in an oppressed civic space where the government opposes any form of dissent or opposition and shuts down easy and accessible channels of communication at will.
