Returning Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has said he expects to have Eden Hazard and Gareth Bale in his squad next season. Ancelotti stated this on Wednesday, during an introductory press conference. The Italian returned to the Santiago Bernabeu from Everton on Tuesday. The 61-year-old was asked about Eden Hazard, who has yet to find his best form while battling injuries during his two seasons at the club. Ancelotti explains why he returned to Real Madrid “Hazard is a top player, he has had injury problems and hasn’t shown his top potential yet here. I believe he can do that next year. He wants to and is motivated,” Ancelotti said. On Bale, who spent the 2020/2021 season on loan at former club Tottenham, he added: “Gareth has not played much in the Premier League. “But he scored lots of goals, was very effective in recent games when he had a chance to play. He is coming back, I know him very well, he will be motivated to play better and have a great season, no doubt.” EPL: Gareth Bale takes swipe at Mourinho after Tottenham beat Southampton
