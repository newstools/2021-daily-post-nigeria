Former Big Brother Naija housemate, Tolanibaj and Vee had a heated argument during the reunion show on Monday, which almost led to fracas. The argument ensued after the show host, Ebuka Uchendu asked Vee how she felt when Tolanibaj said she wanted to use her boyfriend, Neo to make Prince who she liked jealous. Vee said she didn’t know about the triangle until the finale and added that all the insults she hurled at Tolanibaj in the house was from a place of pain. BBNaija Reunion: Why my relationship with Tolanibaj failed – PrinceAccording to her, Tolanibaj claimed she is not desperate but it was painful because she felt betrayed by her. “Your friends watching at home should be scared of you. How do you do that to someone you are friends with? I remember when I came out of the house, I apologized for all I said but after I got my phone and saw all the clips. I felt stupid. You claim not to be desperate but desperation is written all over you. Tolanibaj who fired back, asked if Vee was trying to cause a scene or mad that she blocked her. She, however, picked a pillow and threw it at Vee. Tolanibaj further accused Vee of being a bitterleaf and a witch. She stated that Vee was a wicked person for putting pepper in her food so that ulcer patients in the house would not eat. But Vee continued, “I agree I am a witch and bitterleaf. I was irrational in the house and I apologized for that but I feel Tolanibaj has always had something against me. I saw the venom in her face. You keep saying you are bad but you see me everywhere, yet you didn’t do anything until now. “I have every single right to be angry.” But Tolanibaj promised to teach Vee a lesson at their Hotel after the shoot. “I will teach you that I’m not your mate. We will meet at the hotel. When you see Tolanibaj, you will go another way. I want to smack you on live TV,” she said.
