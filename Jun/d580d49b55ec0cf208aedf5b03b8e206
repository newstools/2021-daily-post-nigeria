Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr has revealed that their opening 2022 World Cup qualifier against Liberia will be played at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos. This means Nigeria will return to the stadium where they hosted Lesotho in their last 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in March. It was the national team’s first competitive game in the country’s commercial capital in 20 years. Uyo had been home to the Super Eagles for years, but they have not played at the Akwa Ibom Stadium since 2019. They are now set to continue in Lagos, with Rohr confirming it after the friendly match against Cameroon. “The fans are welcome, we hope that the fans can come to the stadium in September, that this crazy pandemic which is making things difficult for everybody will allow them to be with us,” Rohr said. “We have to start well in Lagos in the Teslim Balogun stadium,” he added. The 2022 World Cup qualifiers were initially scheduled to start in June, but CAF moved it to September as some countries’ host stadiums did not meet FIFA’s standards.
