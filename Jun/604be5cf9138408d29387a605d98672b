Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has expressed sadness over the death of Professor Godswill Obioma, the National Examinations Council (NECO) Registrar. There is confusion over the cause of death due to conflicting accounts of his final moments. Nigerians have called for an inquiry and urged federal authorities to order an independent autopsy. NECO Registrar, Godswill Obioma: Confusion over cause of death sparks cover up claims On Wednesday, Ortom lamented that Obioma, an ex-Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Resident Commissioner in Ebonyi, was murdered. He was reacting to the assasination of retired Assistant Inspector General of Police, Christopher Dega, his Senior Special Assistant on Security. “Retired AIG Dega served with me here. This is someone who has retired but is not tired and is still active. “For him to have been murdered in the manner that they did…a retired AIG gunned!” NECO confirms Registrar, Obioma died of heart failure “Then Professor Obioma, can you imagine? A whole Professor just killed in that manner. Look at what is happening.” The Benue helmsman reiterated his declaration that the government had failed. “It is unfortunate, these killings are unwarranted. If (only) the government were ready to listen to superior ideas, advise, and be proactive. “I’m part of the government, I cannot run away from it. I can equally say we have failed. “The primary responsibility of any government is to provide security for lives and property. “If there is no security, nothing meaningful can thrive. There can be no development. “Nobody will create industries or bring investment to Nigeria. No economic activities can go on, everybody will be afraid”, Ortom said.
