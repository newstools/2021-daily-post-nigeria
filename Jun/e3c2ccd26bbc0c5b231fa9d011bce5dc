The Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) says President Muhammadu Buhari is proving to be undemocratic with his government’s ban on Twitter. Auwal Rafsanjani, the Executive Director of CISLAC, in a Democracy Day statement said the CSO is puzzled by the President’s handling of fundamental human rights issues. The organization accused the Buhari administration of shrinking civic spaces by going after social media platforms and their users .Buhari: Some people want coup in Nigeria – Lai Mohammed Rafsanjani recalled that after the Twitter ban, the Attorney General of the Federation and Justice Minister, Abubakar Malami threatened to prosecute Nigerians using Twitter. The director added that days later, the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) ordered television and radio broadcasters to stop tweeting. CISLAC said the events, along with media harassment and illegal ban on protests, are “basic symptoms of the lack of necessary democratic values in the country.” The civic group demanded unconditional respect for citizens’ human rights, irrespective of their socio-economic and status, insisting that freedom of expression is constitutional and not a privilege. “We call on the government at all levels to uphold and allow civic space for meaningful contribution to democratic governance in Nigeria, with a demonstrated commitment to the principles of responsibility and responsiveness for good governance. “We call for the creation of an independent and functional Electoral Offences Commission to investigate and prosecute breaches of relevant electoral provisions including vote buying and rigging.” Rafsanjani further demanded the immediate investigation of the killing of innocent citizens and security personnel to demonstrate social justice and responsive governance.
