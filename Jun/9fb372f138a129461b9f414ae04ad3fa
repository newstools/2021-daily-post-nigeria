The Imo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called for Governor Hope Uzodinma’s immediate resignation over insecurity in the State. Mr Charles Ugwuh, the State Chairman of the party, made the call at a news briefing in Owerri yesterday. Ugwuh stated that PDP was alarmed over the worsening state of insecurity in Imo and the escalation of “militarisation of the state.” Pantami: More stakeholders call for resignation, sack of Buhari’s minister According to him, the governor had demonstrated his inability to protect lives and property of Imo people. He said, “The governor should resign over his failure to protect lives and property. “This has become very necessary in view of the evidence of lack of capacity of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to guarantee safety and security of lives and property of Imo people.” Ugwuh also raised the alarm over the alleged intimidation and harassment of innocent residents and the burning of police stations and Independent National Electoral Commission offices. He said, “Our party finds it too worrisome that on a daily basis, innocent civilians and security personnel are mowed down. Ebonyi: Another aide to Umahi, Monday Eze resigns
Also, arson, murder and carnage have become the lot of the hitherto most peaceful state in Nigeria. “The climax is the gruesome murder of Ahmed Gulak, a former member of PDP and an aide to President Goodluck Jonathan.” The chairman said the party had called on civil society organisations and Imo stakeholders to unite to find a lasting solution to the security problem in the state. He charged Uzodinma to account for the lives of innocent security agents and other residents that were killed in the conflict. Imo Prison Break: Hope Uzodinma reacts, sets up commission of inquiry
