Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has revealed his former manager Sir Alex Ferguson’s prediction for England’s Euro 2020 clash against Scotland on Friday. Scotland will tackle England at Wembley on Friday evening after losing 2-0 to Czech Republic in their Group D opener on Monday. According to Ferdinand, Ferguson backed Scotland to ‘overrun’ England, who won their first game against Croatia on Sunday. Speaking on his Vibe With Five YouTube show, Ferdinand said: “Can I just say something: Scotland are getting beaten 1-0! “Sir Alex Ferguson has been on my phone all morning. Let me see if I can text him back right now. I am gonna text him now: “Are you OK boss?” “He thinks they [Scotland] are going to beat us [England], he thinks they are going to overrun England. They have got to get past this first game before that!” The kick-off time for England vs Scotland is 8 pm. World Cup qualifiers: Michael Owen predicts England, Italy, Belgium, other matches
