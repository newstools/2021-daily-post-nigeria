Belgium coach, Roberto Martinez, has provided the latest injury update on Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard ahead of his side’s Euro 2020 quarter-final tie against Italy on Friday. Both De Bruyne and Hazard sustained injuries during Belgium’s 1-0 win over Portugal in the round of 16 encounter on Sunday night. Belgium eliminated Portugal from the European Championship in Seville, following a first-half belter from Thorgan Hazard. Providing an update on both players, Martinez said that De Bruyne sustained an ankle injury, while Hazard picked up a muscle injury. “It’s too early to say how they [De Bruyne and Hazard] are doing,” Martinez said at his post-match press conference. “With Kevin, it’s the ankle – he couldn’t really turn in the second half. With Eden, it is the muscle, but we have to wait for a diagnosis.”
