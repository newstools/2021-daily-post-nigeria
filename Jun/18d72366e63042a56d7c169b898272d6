England manager, Gareth Southgate, will make two changes to the team to face Scotland in a much anticipated Euro 2020 against Scotland on Friday. Daily Mail reports that Southgate is seriously considering rotating his full backs for the game at Wembley. Reece James is ready to replace Kyle Walker at right back and Luke Shaw is set to pip Ben Chilwell in the race to replace Kieran Trippier on the opposite flank. Southgate will keep faith with Tyrone Mings in central defence despite first-choice centre back, Harry Maguire declaring himself fit following an ankle ligament injury that has kept him out for six weeks. A win against the Scots will see England qualify for the knockout stages. Southgate has admitted that winning the countryâ€™s first trophy in 55 years would define his reign as England boss.
