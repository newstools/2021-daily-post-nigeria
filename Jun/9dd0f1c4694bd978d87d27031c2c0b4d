Mike Bamiloye, Founder of Mount Zion Faith Ministries International, has described as ‘living dead, women who beat their husband. The cleric, who kicked against domestic violence in a post on his Instagram page, said any man that beats his wife deserves to be in a psychiatric hospital. According to him, any man who uses a belt, or beats his wife, or even uses any violent means on his wife is worthy of being awarded a duplex at a psychiatric hospital. “When a man uses belt, wire, blow, knife, slap or any domestic violent means in his wife, he is worthy to be awarded a duplex at Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital or he can just go there himself and tell them to admit him there until he is okay. “And a wife that beats her husband is dead and rotten while she is living.” “They set unGodly, carnal standards for themselves” – Mike Bamiloye reveals why some ladies are single
