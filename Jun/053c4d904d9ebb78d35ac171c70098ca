Real Madrid left-back, Marcelo, will become the club’s next captain, following the departure of Sergio Ramos. Football transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, has confirmed Marcelo will not leave the Spanish giants this summer and the club has other plans for him. Romano tweeted: “Real Madrid have never been intentioned to sell Marcelo. He’s staying and he’s considered a key player for Ancelotti’s team, the board never had any doubt. “Marcelo is gonna be the captain next season and he’s happy to stay.” There has been a few concerns about Marcelo’s performances lately, with fears the 33-year-old is beginning to decline. However, the most value is placed on the leadership and experience that he brings to the Real Madrid locker room.
