Former Manchester United goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel, has criticised UEFA for their ‘ridiculous’ decision to play on with Denmark’s Euro 2020 tie against Finland on Saturday after Christian Eriksen’s collapse. The Inter Milan midfielder dropped to the ground towards the end of the first half and required CPR treatment from medical staff on the pitch. Denmark players, who formed a protective shield around Eriksen even as he was treated, were visibly disturb and in pain. Eriksen was eventually rushed to hospital and UEFA subsequently confirmed that the game would continue as Finland defeated Denmark 1-0, thanks to Joel Pohjanpalo’s only goal of the match.
