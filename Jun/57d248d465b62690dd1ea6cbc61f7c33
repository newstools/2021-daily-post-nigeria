Yakubu made this known on Monday in Abuja during an interview with newsmen, NAN reports. “Our attention has been drawn to media reports ascribing to me alleged fraudulent dealing around the plan by the NNPC to acquire equity participation in DORC. “The publication is very embarrassing, disgusting and above all, horrifying and damaging to my character and personality as a dutiful officer of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and more importantly as a top management staff of NNPC. First Bank in trouble over breach of contract, gets 48 hours to obey court order “I hereby state categorically that I did not speak with any news person or organisation on the issue. “I wish also to state that, to the best of my knowledge, there is no such plan or fraudulent motive behind the equity acquisition arrangement with the DORC or any of the other private refinery that NNPC is in talks with,’’ he said Recall that the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) earlier warned the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to ensure transparency in the planned purchase of 20 percent shares in Dangote refinery. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan in a statement said it has nothing against any genuine and honest incentives for private refineries, but demanded such must not be used as avenues for siphoning funds from national treasury.
