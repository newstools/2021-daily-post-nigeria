Real Madrid midfielder, Eden Hazard, has said his numerous ankle fractures means he would never be the same player as he was 10 years ago. Hazard will start for the first time in Euro 2020 in Belgium’s last Group B match against Finland on Monday. But the 28-year-old admits he might not be ready to complete the full 90 minutes. “I never doubted my qualities, but whether I would be 100% fit for the European Championship was going to be a question. “I broke my ankle three times, it will never be the same as 10 years ago. But I know that when I am in shape, that I can prove myself on the field and that’s what I’m working on now. “I’m not 100% yet, but I’m ready to start. But that was the plan, to bring me along gradually. It’s especially important to be completely fit in the knockout phase. Then I have to be in top shape,” Hazard said. Hazard was introduced as a substitute in Belgium’s first two games. He had been a fitness doubt in Belgium’s pre-tournament preparations after an injury-filled season at Real Madrid.
