President Muhammadu Buhari has said that only the National Assembly can deal with the issues of restructuring the country. Buhari described restructuring as a contentious issue, adding that in whichever forms it comes be it true federalism or devolution of powers, it remains a constitutional matter. The President, however, reiterated his position on devolving more power to the people. Constitution review: Gov. El-Rufai suggests devolution of powers to reduce burden on FG Buhari said this when he received members of the Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) led by Co-Chairmen, Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar and President of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Samson Supo Ayokunle, at the State House on Friday. “On the contentious issue of restructuring or true federalism or devolution of powers, like you all know, this is a constitutional matter with which only the National Assembly can deal. “I remain an unapologetic believer in devolving power to the people and that is why I signed the Executive Order granting autonomy to State Legislature and Judiciary,” Buhari said. Buhari noted that autonomy to State Legislature and Judiciary met with some resistance at the state level, leading to a more than two months’ strike action that has cost the country so much. Buhari said that he hopes the review of the constitution currently going on at the National Assembly would address some of the burning issues agitating the minds of our people. Buhari said that efforts were being made to create a more conducive environment to address both direct and indirect causes of insecurity including job creation.
