The Presidency has insisted that the temporary suspension of Twitter in Nigeria was not just a response to the removal of President Muhammadu Buhari’s post. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, said this in a statement on Saturday. According to him, Twitter does not seem to appreciate the national trauma of our country’s civil war. Recall that Twitter had on Wednesday deleted Buhari’s tweet for violating its rules. Nigerians had demanded for the suspension of Buhari’s Twitter account for saying individuals who want to destroy the present government will receive the shock of their lives. Twitter said Buhari’s threat violated its rules and pulled down his tweet. The statement read in part, “The temporary suspension of Twitter is not just a response to the removal of the President’s post. “There has been a litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences. All the while, the company has escaped accountability. “Nevertheless, the removal of President Buhari’s tweet was disappointing. The censoring seemed based on a misunderstanding of the challenges Nigeria faces today. “This and similar crimes which have been fueled by social media networks risk seeping into the fabric of an emerging digital culture. “This isn’t a promotion of hate, but a pledge to uphold citizens’ right to freedom from harm. The government can’t be expected to capitulate to terrorists. “Twitter doesn’t seem to appreciate the national trauma of our country’s civil war. This government shall not allow a recurrence of that tragedy.” Insecurity: Allow military take over immediately, divide Nigeria into six states – Clarke tells Buhari
