Support groups in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) under the aegis of Coalition of PDP Support Groups (CPSG), have called for a credible primary election to chose the party’s candidate on Wednesdays in Anambra State. The groups also urged the party to ensure that there is fairness in the exercise, in order not to leave any of its aspirants aggrieved. The coordinator of the support groups, Mr Onyedikachi Kalu who addressed a press conference in Awka said the forthcoming governorship election is an opportunity for the PDP to return to the Anambra government house but called on the delegates of the party to start by choosing a credible candidate. Kalu said: “We the PDP support groups, duly registered and recognized are requesting for a credible, transparent and all-inclusive party governorship primary that will produce a credible and acceptable candidate. Electoral Act must be amended for credible elections – Sen Gyang “This will further unite the party and guarantee its victory in the November 6 election in Anambra State. The upcoming election presents a golden opportunity for PDP to bounce back in the entire Southeast. “The onus of choosing a credible, acceptable and accessible candidate becomes very critical, as any mistake in this regard is capable of making the party lose the state (God forbid).” The group said it believes that if a free and fair primary election is held and an acceptable candidate emerges, pre and post-election litigations will not Arise. It added, “We plead with the delegates to see this task of electing a governorship candidate of the party as a responsibility that must be carried out satisfactorily without bias. They should vote according to their conscience.”
