Former Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur striker, Peter Crouch, has predicted the outcome of today’s Euro 2020 round of 16 tie between England and Germany. The tie will be played at Wembley Stadium at 5pm. The Three Lions head to the game following a 1-0 victory against Czech Republic in their last game, while Germany played a 2-2 draw with Hungary. Providing his prediction, Crouch told Metro, “But we had a top side and thought we would win. “This Germany team now is not the one of the past but do not underestimate them by any means, that would be daft.” He added, “Let’s not dress it up, Harry [Kane] has not been at his best, but when a chance comes along against Germany, or we win a penalty on Tuesday, who do you want to take it?’ “We have the attacking talent to go and beat teams. “It’s been difficult to tell so far, but we will find that out against Germany. “My heart says 2-1… I won’t say what my head says! If we beat them, I think it is on. I will start believing then. The whole country will be galvanised and the draw after that looks more favourable.”
