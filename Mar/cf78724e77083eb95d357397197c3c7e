Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has admitted he is worried about the absence of Mason Mount and Jorginho, ahead of their Champions League game against Atletico Madrid. However, he has backed the rest of the squad, to step up and find the goals that will see them qualify for the quarter-final of the competition. Mount and Jorginho are both suspended for the second leg at Stamford Bridge, after their yellow cards during the 1-0 win in Madrid. Both midfielders have scored three times each since Tuchel took charge. “Yeah, a little bit, of course,” Tuchel said when asked if missing the midfielders was a worry. “Two key players for us. Especially Mason for his offensive skills; his power offensive-wise to break the lines with dribbling and shots. “They were important players so far and we have a group which we compete with in this competition and so now is the challenge to adapt and find solutions because it’s obvious we need to play without those two guys. “We also need to play without Thiago Silva and without Tammy Abraham. No more injuries, so we miss four players. That makes the selection easy. We have a clear idea of what we want to do and how we want to create chances. But we are very aware that Atletico is one of the teams that give away the fewest chances in all of Europe. “It’s very likely that we have to be patient and play with intensity at the same time. Keeping this level constantly going is the key for tomorrow.”
