Arsenal striker, Alexandre Lacazette, has admitted he was “lucky” to win the decisive penalty against Tottenham at Emirates Stadium. The Gunners defeated their North London rivals 2-1 on Sunday. Erik Lamela opened scoring for the visitors, before goals from Martin Odegaard and Lacazette sealed the victory. There was, however, some controversy about Lacazette’s winner, with the Frenchman having already kicked wildly at the ball when through on goal, before Davinson Sanchez was penalised for a late tackle. “We are lucky to get the penalty, I think, but of course, I am happy,” Lacazette told reporters after the game. “Back in the days I have taken a lot of penalties against him [Hugo Lloris] but I was confident.”
