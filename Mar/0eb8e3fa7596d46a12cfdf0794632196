Hussaini Marte, Chief of Staff to Borno Governor, Babagana Zulum, said the purported impeachment moves by the states House of Assembly was fabricated. Marte spoke on Sunday while addressing lawmakers and others at a Northern Borno Students’ Association event organised in collaboration with the assembly. The top aide stressed that Zulum has had a cordial working relationship with the assembly. Marte said the legislature had done well in terms of relationship with the executive and passage of bills. “What happened (impeachment rumours) is most unfortunate. It’s just mischief by someone to cause confusion. That person will not succeed”, NAN quoted him as saying. “I want to inform all members of the Assembly that His Excellency has not taken that seriously, as he believes you can’t do anything like that.” The Chief of Staff assured the legislators of the continued commitment of the executive arm. The Borno State Assembly Speaker, Abdulkarim Lawan, also described the impeachment moves as mere speculations. The lawmaker recalled that the House conducted an extra-ordinary session to debunk the claim and passed a vote of confidence on the governor.
