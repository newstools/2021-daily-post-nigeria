Benedicta Elechi, ex-wife to the controversial On-Air Personality, OAP, Ifedayo Olarinde, a.k.a Daddy Freeze, has alleged that he abused her physically while they were still together as a couple. Benedicta, who made this known in a post via her Instagram account while celebrating International Women’s Day, shared a medical report as proof to back up her allegations. She also spoke about women’s rights, while calling for the abolishment of archaic practices that have “enslaved” women for ages. “Today is a day, women all over the world, come together to celebrate the diverse achievements of women. “Sadly, we live in a country where the fundamental rights of women are nonexistent. “We should be observing a moment of silence for the fearless women, who fought to the death for the rights of women and children. “We ought to be celebrating all the strong women who have fought and will continue to fight for the abolishment of ancient practices and the reformation of laws that have enslaved women for decades in unison. “But no, as women, living in this part of the world, it will be hypocritical for us to to partake in this celebration. “This day should mark the beginning of making actions to ensure gender equality and reforms that will protect our fundamental rights as women.We owe this to every girl child,” she said. Recall that Daddy Freeze was recently fined the sum of N5 million by a High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, for committing adultery.
