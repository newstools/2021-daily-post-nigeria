Manchester United have received a major boost ahead of their Europa League clash with AC Milan, as Edinson Cavani, David De Gea and Paul Pogba have all been declared fit. Cavani and Pogba sat out the first leg of their round of 16 clashes through injury, as United were held to a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. Dean Henderson also manned the goalposts as David de Gea was quarantined following a trip to Spain. The club has confirmed that all three players will be part of the travelling squad to Italy on Wednesday, along with Donny van de Beek who has shaken off a muscle problem. However, Anthony Martial has been left out, while he continues his recovery from a hip issue. “David de Gea is back in the squad after taking paternity leave to witness the birth of his first child, while Paul Pogba and Donny van de Beek return to bolster our midfield flexibility,” a statement on United’s official website reads. “Edinson Cavani is also available for selection once again, though Anthony Martial has not overcome the injury he picked up in the first leg.”
