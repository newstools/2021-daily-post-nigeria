Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu on Wednesday revealed that End SARS protesters who invaded his palace in October 2020, allegedly stole $2 million and N17 million from him. Oba Akiolu disclosed this while speaking at the Glover Hall Memorial Commissioning, Lagos on Wednesday. Akiolu said $2 million and N17 million were stolen from his palace during the raid. “The destruction we suffered in Lagos during the End SARS protest is so enormous than in any other part of the country. “Many buildings were burnt, including vehicles used to generate income. I can now say publicly that they stole away from my palace $2 million and N17 million. “Those who committed the offence would not have done that if they knew the implication. But as a father, I won’t place any curse on them.” The monarch urged the Federal Government to assist Lagos to recover from the destruction, stressing that the state suffered more than any other states from the aftermath of the End SARS protest. Recall that some hoodlums in the area had invaded the palace during the protest against extra-judicial killing of Nigerians by operatives of the now-disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). This was after soldiers opened live ammunition on protesters at the Lekki toll plaza on October 20, 2020. Some of the hoodlums at the time destroyed properties in Oba Akiolu’s residence and went away with the staff of office.
