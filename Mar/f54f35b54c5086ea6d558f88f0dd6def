Mr Muhammad Nami, the Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), has hailed Nigerian mothers and their counterparts worldwide for their untiring contributions to family stability and national development. Nami made the statement on the occasion of this year’s International Mother’s Day in a statement issued at the weekend in Abuja. He commended mothers for their tenacity of purpose and leadership in situations of distress like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The statement reads in part: “On the occasion of this year’s International Mother’s Day, I felicitate with the mothers across the world and commend their resilience, the tenacity of purpose and leadership, especially in situations of distress. “I particularly wish to identify with the mothers who are having to grapple with the hardship occasioned by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted businesses globally on which most of them and their children depend for their livelihood. “I also recognise the position of mothers as the bedrock of the family, which is the nucleus of society. “I, therefore, call on governments all over the world to evolve programmes of support and empowerment for mothers and their children. “We, at the FIRS, are supportive of women and mothers in their respective desire to become professionals in their chosen careers.”
