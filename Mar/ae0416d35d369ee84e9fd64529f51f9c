Prophet Joshua Iginla of the Champions Royal Assembly, has urged the Federal Government and Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, popular Islamic cleric to secure the release of abducted Pastor Bulus Yakuru. Prophet Iginla said the federal government and Gumi should adopt the negotiation measure used in releasing abducted students to ensure pastor Bulus’ freedom. The Abubakar Shekau-led faction of Boko Haram had abducted the pastor of Church of the Brethren (EYN) on 24 December, 2020, during an attack on Pemi village in Borno State. The terrorist group had threatened to kill Pastor Bulus within seven days. Reacting, Prophet Iginla in a statement he sent to DAILY POST prayed for the release of Bulus. He said: “Am a bit worried over the pastor that was captured in Borno and given 7 days ultimatum. “I watched the clip asking for the federal government to come his rescue. We will pray for him and urge government to look at it that aside being a pastor and a Christian, he is a citizen of this country. “If the captured students can be released through negotiation with the bandits, then they should negotiate for this pastor too. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. “I beg the federal government to negotiate for his release if they can’t rescue him by sending military personnel. If we don’t have a clergy who knows these people then the sheikh Gumi should rise to this occasion too for the release of this pastor. “If we don’t speak out, they might behead him. We still have Leah in custody, and I’m worried. If the other people from other religions were being released then they should use the same means to release these other people from other religions too.”
