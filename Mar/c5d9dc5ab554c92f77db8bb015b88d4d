Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has expressed disappointment following his side’s Premier League 1-1 draw with Burnley on Saturday afternoon. The Spaniard said that Arsenal gave Burnley hope during the encounter because the Gunners allowed the host to score a goal in a situation they trained for. Goals from Chris Wood and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ensured both Arsenal and Burnley shared a point each at Turf Moor. “I’m really disappointed with the result, but the reality is that we generated so many big chances but only scored one goal,” Arteta told Arsenal Media after the game. “When you do that, and then you give a goal to the opponent as we did, then you don’t get the referee’s decision when it is clear and obvious, then it becomes really difficult to win a football match. “We started well and then that is when you have to put the game away, and it has to be two or three-nil, and the game is over. “We gave them hope because we gave them a goal in a situation that we train for, and it can happen, but then we struggled for 20 to 25 minutes in the second half because we played their game.”
