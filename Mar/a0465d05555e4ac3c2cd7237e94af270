Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has admitted that he is treating some of his stars, including Tammy Abraham, Christian Pulisic and Emerson unfairly. He said those players suffer from bad decision from him, adding that they deserve places in his XI. Tuchel led Chelsea to their eleven games unbeaten on Monday night, with a 2-0 win over Everton at Stamford Bridge. It was also a historic 5th home clean sheet for the German. And reflecting on those players who have missed out recently, such as Pulisic, Emerson and Abraham, the former Borussia Dortmund manager told the club’s official website, “Maybe Christian’s problem is I know from Dortmund how strong he is from the bench. “I think he started only in the cup game and in the end that’s my responsibility and my fault. “It’s a bit unfair because I know what an impact he can have in 20 or 30 minutes. He was a bit unlucky in the last games but there’s no lack of trust or quality. He just has to be a bit patient. ‘We also have another guy I would love to mention which is Emerson, who suffers from bad decisions against him from me. “He does not play but he is an amazing guy who trains at the highest levels and never lets the team down with his mentality. “This was a super hard decision today to have him out of the squad and the same with Tammy [Abraham].” Tuchel has used the German duo of Timo Werner, Kai Havertz in the number 9 position in the last couple of games and by this denying Abraham and Olivier Giroud game opportunities. The German tactician had said he was ‘very pleased’ with Havertz’s performance.
