The Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has said his administration has no plan to ban commercial motorcyclists popularly known as Okada in the state. Makinde spoke during the inauguration of a newly constructed ultra-modern commercial motorcyclist and tricycle loading points in Ibadan, the state capital, NAN reports. The governor pledged to re-organise and coordinate the operations of Okada/tricycle riders to meet modern ways of doing transport business. “We also want you to be coordinated and organised. I already told the people in charge to install solar lights here so that you can all do your businesses comfortably at night. “We have security challenges and I must say that Okada and tricycle operators have to help the government. “When you are organised, you can fish out those who are using Okada and tricycles to commit crimes and hand them over to the law enforcement agencies,” the governor said.
