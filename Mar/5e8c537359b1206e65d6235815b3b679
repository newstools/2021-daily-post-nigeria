UEFA has confirmed that five substitutes will be allowed at this year’s Euro 2020, as the football world continues to adjust to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement today, European football’s governing body explained that the decision to allow five subs at the delayed tournament, had been taken as “the rule is already in place for the World Cup qualification matches that will run from March 2021 to March 2022.” “The reasons for the five-substitutions rule remain valid against the background of national and international football calendars affected by the Covid-19 pandemic,” the statement continued. UEFA added that the rule would continue to be in place for the Nations League finals in October and its relegation “play-outs” in March next year. The move to increase the number of substitutes from three to five has already been implemented in the Champions League and Europa League, as well as domestic competitions around the continent.
