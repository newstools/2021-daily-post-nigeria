Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has compared Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea to the Frank Lampard era. Ferdinand said a change in ethos and a rebuilding of relationships with experienced players has been a big difference to Tuchel than Lampard’s reign during his time at the Blues. Tuchel has not lost a game in his last 14 games as Chelsea manager since he replaced Lampard last January. The former PSG manager has guided Chelsea to the Champions League’s quarter-final and the FA Cup semi-final. “It’s down to coaching on the training pitch, 100%,” Ferdinand told Vibe with FIVE. “Being able to translate your ideas and what you need from individuals and as a collective and doing that on the TV screen in the classroom and getting it out on the pitch in training sessions. “One of the key things is having Kante central in midfield. The amount of balls he’s won back for that team to maintain possession and to maintain position on the pitch has been phenomenal. “I think bringing experience back into the team and giving them more responsibility has been a big difference to Frank’s. “Frank definitely went with the younger players, and I think that knocked a few of the older players’ noses out of joint, and they may have reacted negatively towards that. “That created a problem. But these players have come back in – Tuchel has rounded up the experienced player and told them, you’re here, you’re my mainstay, and the younger players, you’re going to be a part of that as well. “But the older players, don’t worry, you’re with me, and they’ve all bought back in after not feeling a part of it before. “Frank, the team was a bit more fluid going forward, and they scored more goals, but they conceded more goals. “He thought I have got players that can nick me a result a 1-0 or a 2-0 on the counterattack or at a moment comes in the game, they’ll score us a goal, but I’m not conceding goals. That’s how it’s played out for him. It’s been amazing, really.”
