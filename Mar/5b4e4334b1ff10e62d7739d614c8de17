Liverpool and Manchester United will be free to fly into Spain to take on Real Madrid and Granada in the Champions League and Europa League respectively. SportsMail reports the ban on flights from the UK in Spain is set to be lifted next week. Liverpool played both legs of their Champions League last 16 tie against RB Leipzig on neutral ground at the Puskas Arena in Budapest. United, meanwhile, played their last 32 Europa League away leg last month against another Spanish side, Real Sociedad, at the Allianz Stadium in Turin. But the Red Devils will travel to Spain to face Granada, after the countryâ€™s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and his government announced the lifting of the restrictions. The travel ban on arrivals by air and sea from the UK has been in place since December 22 and will end from Tuesday, March 30.
