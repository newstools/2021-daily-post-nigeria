Niger State House of Assembly has directed the reinstatement of the embattled Chairman of Shiroro local government, Suleiman Dauda Chukuba. Chukuba was suspended over the alleged mismanagement of funds. The call for his reinstatement follows the recommendation of the report of the House Committee on local government on the crisis of Shiroro local government area of Niger State during plenary. Presenting the report, the Committee Chairman, Hon. Shuaib Liman Iya noted that the Legislators failed to follow due process during the meeting that led to the suspension of the chairman of the council as there was no minute to show, thereby making their resolution null and void. “The activity of legislation is a serious business and due process must be followed to the requirement of the law. For any decision to be taken, a proper legislative siting must be convened and minutes were taken. “However, on this matter, there was no minute of the council Legislators sitting, this shows that there is no evidence that they sat. This renders their resolution and action on the suspension of the Chairman illegal, null and void”, the Committee Chairman stated. However, the Council’s Vice-Chairman and the nine Councillors were suspended for their refusal to appear before the committee for questioning on the crisis in the council. Also, the lawmakers directed the councillors to refund to the council’s treasury the N500,000 they collected. Frowning at the way the Legislators flaunted the law by not completing the requirement of meeting for 90 days for a legislative year, the House then directed the Chairman to resume his official duties and all allowances lost during the period of his suspension be paid to him. The Chairman, it would be recalled was suspended over a petition on the allegation of the misappropriation of N50 million tenement rate among others.
