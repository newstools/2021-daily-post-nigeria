Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez have broken up their engagement. E! News confirmed that the Hollywood couple has called off their engagement which is nearly two years. Rodriguez proposed to Lopez in the Bahamas in March 2019 after dating for two years. The news comes as a shock to fans after Jennifer Lopez and Alex spent Valentine’s Day together and also attended the Super Bowl in Miami in February. The couple is yet to give details and reason for the break-up. Alex had earlier announced that their marriage ceremony was postponed in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “You know we tried twice to get married in 2020. We got bit twice by Coronavirus. “But you know, they say third time’s a charm, so let’s hope it is what we want to hear,” Alex shared on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” Jennifer also told Elle magazine some months ago that they postponed the wedding twice because they were not eager to say ‘I do’. “We had planned what we really, really wanted for the wedding, I don’t know if we will be able to re-create that. “We canceled it, and since then, we have not really talked about it,” Jennifer said.
