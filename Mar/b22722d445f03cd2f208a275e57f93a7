Grammy award winner, Burna Boy, has described the reception by Rivers State Government as the biggest honour bestowed on him since he was born. Burna Boy said this during his visit on Saturday to Rivers state. The singer, who recently won Grammy 2021 for Best Global Album was received by Governor Nyesom Wike in the government house. Burna Boy said, “I am deeply grateful and incredibly humbled by the reception and honour to be conferred on him by the Government of Rivers State. “I really appreciate being in my state. This is probably the biggest honour that will be bestowed on me since I was born. It is one thing to win the Grammy and to be applauded everywhere else in the world and another thing to be loved in your own home and that to me is worth more than anything I can get.” Burna Boy appreciated Governor Wike for taking out time to honour him. “I appreciate you my Governor for taking your time out to do this,” Burna added.
