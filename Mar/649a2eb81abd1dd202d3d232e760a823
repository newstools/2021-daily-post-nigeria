Borno State Governor, Babagana Umara Zulum, on Friday, visited Dikwa town where he assessed the destruction carried out by ISWAP militants on Monday. Dikwa is about 90km from Maiduguri, the Borno state capital in the northeast Nigeria. Zulum was taken round the destructions by the insurgents, which includes: the palace of the Shehu of Dikwa, Nigerian Army’s 81 DIV TF BN, NASC 9 Headquarters, 22 Armored Brigade headquarters, UN Humanitarian Hub, Primary Healthcare Centre and IDP camps. The Governor ordered the Ministry of Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Resettlement to rehabilitate all destroyed properties, including those belonging to the military. He consoled families affected by the attack, and charged all residents to cooperate with the security operatives by reporting suspicious movements at all times. While joining residents for Friday congregational prayers, Zulum informed them that he had met with President Muhammadu Buhari over the attack and the President assured him of taking steps to ensure end to the conflict in the northeast Nigeria. “I had a meeting with Mr. President on Tuesday, he has given me assurance that steps are being deployed to ensure your safety. “I urge you to be patient and resilient, we are aware of the very difficult conditions you find yourselves and we are in this together, we are not resting. We are doing whatever we can and insha’Allah, we will achieve our aim,” Zulum said.
