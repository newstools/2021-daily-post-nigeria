Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has confirmed Marcus Rashford will need a scan on his ankle. Rashford provided his 10th assist in all competitions to set up Luke Shaw, as United defeated Manchester City 2-0 on Sunday. But the England forward went down holding his left ankle with 20 minutes left at The Etihad. Solskjaer will be hoping Rashford makes a quick recovery ahead of their Europa League last-16 first-leg clash with AC Milan on Thursday night. When asked about the severity of Rashford’s injury at his post-match press conference, Solskjaer said: “I don’t know. It’s something with his ankle. “When he sprinted 70 yards to save a goal, it showed the attitude of the boy. “I think he went over on his ankle, but we need to do a scan. I have not had time to speak to the doctor yet.”
