Rabiu Kwankwaso, former Governor of Kano State, has said people of the State need education and entrepreneurial skills more than flyovers and bridges. Kwankwaso made the remark while berating the State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, over plans to construct a flyover with a loan at the Hotoro roundabout in Kano State. Speaking with BBC Hausa Service on Friday, Kwankwaso called on Ganduje to focus more on the education sector in the State. He said: “Even though we need flyovers in Kano, but what people need the most in the state is education. They need to focus more on our children to be educated and get entrepreneurial skills to depend on themselves. “Instead of Ganduje to go and see the president and ask him to do the bridge, because it is the responsibility of the federal government to do the flyovers connecting Kano City to Wudil, the governor went ahead and presented a photo that was badly designed which even the president did not understand and has something better in his office.” Ganduje had met with President Muhammadu Buhari and presented the prototype of a three-level road interchange along the Kano-Maiduguri road. The project, when completed, will be named after the President.
