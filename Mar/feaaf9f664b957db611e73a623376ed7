The Kaduna State Government has confirmed that several bandits were neutralized, and their camps destroyed in joint ground and air patrols conducted across Igabi, Giwa, Birnin Gwari and Chikun local government areas of the state. This was made known on Thursday in a statement by Samuel Aruwan, the state Commissioner, Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs. The statement reads in part, “Several aerial missions were conducted covering locations in Birnin Gwari, Giwa Igabi and Chikun local government areas. These missions were carried out in tandem with ground patrols in the areas. “According to operational feedback, the first aerial mission covered the Riyawa camp, which was engaged with rockets. “Close air support was then given to troops of Operation Taimako Yazo along Kaduna-Birnin Gwari road, covering Crossing Point, Udawa, Buruku, Koriga, Polewire and environs. Normal activities were observed across all areas. “Another pass was made over the Birnin Gwari area with an informant on board the aircraft to identify target locations. “Some bandits sighted fleeing the area were also neutralized.” Governor Nasir El-Rufai, however, thanked the troops and crews for the extensive joint missions and commended their thoroughness and commitment.
