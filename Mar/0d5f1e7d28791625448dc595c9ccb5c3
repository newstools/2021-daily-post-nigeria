The Oyo State chapter of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) has collapsed its structure in all the 33 local government areas of the state. Our correspondent reports that the structure of the party was collapsed on Tuesday, ahead of the 2023 general elections. The party during a meeting attended by its stalwarts announced its migration to the All Progressives Congress (APC) after the structure of the ZLP was collapsed. The gathering includes members of ZLP, the African Democratic Congress (ADC) Mega Party of Nigeria and other loyalists of a former Governor of the State, Senator Rasidi Ladoja. Some of the party chieftains who attended the meeting held at Samonda in Ibadan included gubernatorial candidate of the party Barrister Sharafadeen Abiodun Alli, his Deputy Hon. Kola Olabiyi, Hon. Bimbo Adepoju among others. Chairman of the party, Mr. Kola Olaniyan while speaking with journalists shortly after the meeting noted party members have been duly informed about the decision. He insisted that the party has tested the two major political parties in the state but decided to move to APC. Olaniyan insisted that one of the reasons for moving to the APC is due to the alleged failure of Governor Seyi Makinde to honour the pact with the party leaders a few days to the 2019 gubernatorial election. Olaniyan said, “We are moving to the APC today. We held a meeting and we have informed our members of the decision. “We are moving to the APC due to the failure of Governor Seyi Makinde to honour the 2019 agreement. “We have informed our members of the decision. “We have collapsed the structure of the party and we have moved to APC.”
