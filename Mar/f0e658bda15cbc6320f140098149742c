Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo has received the COVID-19 vaccine. Osinbajo was administered the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccines by his personal physician, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. After the vaccination, both President Muhammadu Buhari and Osinbajo were presented with their E-vaccination cards. Earlier, President Buhari had received his own vaccine. Recall that Dr Faisal Shuaib, the Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency had said the president and his vice would be vaccinated on Saturday. He disclosed this at a State House briefing in Abuja on Thursday. According to Shuaib, the exercise would boost the confidence of Nigerians to receive the vaccine shipped into the country earlier this week.
