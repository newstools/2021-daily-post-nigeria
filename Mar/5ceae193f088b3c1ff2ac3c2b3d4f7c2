The Kwara State Police Command, on Tuesday, debunked alleged reports of churches set ablaze in Ilorin during Monday’s protest. A statement by the spokesman of the Command, Okasanmi Ajayi in Ilorin, also denied claims by some national dailies that shops were looted and business offices vandalized by protesters in the Ilorin metropolis. “The command wishes to debunk the story in its entirety, no single church was burnt, no shop was looted, neither was any business facility closed down as a result of the hijab milieu,” the statement added. According to the command, the announcement of the opening of mission schools, heralded the protests by the church proprietors who insisted that no female students with hijab, would be allowed entry and the attendant insistence by the Muslims, that the female students must be allowed to enter the schools in hijab. The statement, however, explained that “All through this, the command deployed adequate policemen and other security agencies in all the schools and churches, while the protests which were restricted to the schools have been peaceful. “Efforts by hoodlums to hijack the process was vehemently resisted by the police,” the statement further stated. The state Police Commissioner, Mohammed Lawal Bagega, urged the pressmen to continue with their support as usual and verify their stories before going public. The command also warned that criminals will be arrested and dealt with in accordance with the law.
