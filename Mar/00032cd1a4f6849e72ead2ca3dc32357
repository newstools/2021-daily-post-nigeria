Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) President, Amaju Pinnick, has been elected into the FIFA Council. Pinnick emerged victorious on Friday at the CAF 43rd general meeting in Rabat, Morocco. He won 43 votes to his opponent’s eight votes. Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, said Nigeria and Africa has an additional opportunity to contribute to the administration of world football. Dare’s congratulatory statement was signed by his spokesman, John Joshua-Akanji. The minister charged the NFF chief to use his new position to make Nigeria, African and World football greater. “This is the reward of hard work and unity of purpose. We are better off when we support our collective aspirations for the development of our great country. This is an honour well deserved,” he said. Dare thanked President Muhammadu Buhari, the Foreign Affairs Ministry, football stakeholders and Nigerians for the success. Pinnick becomes the third Nigerian, after late Orok Oyo Orok and Amos Adamu, to occupy the FIFA council seat.
