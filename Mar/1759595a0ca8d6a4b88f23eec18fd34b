Former Super Eagles striker, Yakubu Aiyegbeni, has tipped Manchester City to win the Premier League title this season. According to the ex-Everton man, Pep Guardiola’s pattern of football and depth of quality in his squad will see them crowned champions again. City is 15 points clear at the top having won their last 15 fixtures. “I don’t think anyone can challenge them. I think [they are 15 points already ahead of Manchester United] and 22 points ahead of Liverpool – it’s a long way to go,” Ayegbeni told Goal. “The title is gone already, and Manchester City will win the league. They are going to win for sure.” Manchester City’s last league success came in the 2018/2019 season.
