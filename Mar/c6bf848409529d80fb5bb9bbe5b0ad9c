The presidency has restated that Nigeria will remain integrated despite the challenges confronting the nation and those inciting war for their alleged sectional agenda. The Special Adviser to the president on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, made the assertion in this week’s edition of ‘Fridays With Adesina’ titled WAR AND RUMOURS OF WAR.” In the article, Adesina alleged that some Nigerians rejoice at the country’s security and economic predicament, stressing that their agitation is to see things fall apart in the ‘zoo.’ Recall that the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People Of Biafra, IPOB had several times referred to Nigeria as a ‘zoo’ governed by ‘animals’. According to Buhari’s aide, “Do you know that some Nigerians actually gloat when things go wrong in the country? They rejoice at wanton killings, massive insecurity, prostrate economy, decrepit inter-ethnic relationships, and the like. They want things to fall apart in the ‘zoo.’ But Nigeria will survive. “The singer, Veno Marioghae, said it long ago. Nigeria is like the testicles of a ram. It may sway from side to side as the ram runs, but it will never fall off. Adesina urged those instigating war to consider the interest of the entire country and wish the country well instead of conceiving sectional agenda. The president’s aide who cited a scripture from the Holy Bible (Numbers 14:28), said there is the possibility that spoken words can manifest into reality. He admonished those instigating war and spreading the rumours of war to have a rethink and talk on peace instead of destabilisation and disintegration of Nigeria, adding that Nigerians have no other country. “What we say often has a way of happening to us. “As you have spoken into my ears, so will I do to you.” (Numbers 14:28) Enough about war, destabilization, disintegration”.
