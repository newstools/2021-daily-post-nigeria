Former President, Goodluck Jonathan has said President Muhammadu Buhari and state governors are working towards resolving Nigeria’s security problem. Jonathan said he believes that Buhari and state governors are not sleeping over the burning issue. He spoke during a condolence visit to Ifeanyi Okowa, the Governor of Delta State, over the death of his father. The former president commended Buhari and urged Nigerians to support the effort of ensuring that the country is safe. Jonathan expressed hope that the Buhari-led federal government and governors would be able to resolve Nigeria’s insecurity challenge. He said: “I believe that the president himself is not sleeping, and that the governors are not sleeping as well over the insecurity challenge in the country. “As long as the governors, the president, and all the security agencies can work together, Nigeria will be able to cross over this very ugly phase of societal evolution.” Jonathan spoke at a time when the activities of banditry have intensified in the North. Bandits had abducted several students in Katsina, Niger, and Zamfara States. Amid the issue of banditry, there are also challenges of kidnapping and killings and clashes among herdsmen, farmers and others.
