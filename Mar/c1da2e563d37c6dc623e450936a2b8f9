Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has described as shocking, a Rep members rejection of a petition from the Mutual Union of Tiv in America (MUTA) brought before the House by Hon Mark Gbilla, member representing Gwer East/Gwer West Federal Constituency, Ortom in a statement on Wednesday said the action of Deputy Speaker, Idris Wase, amounts to suppression of the people’s voice and it contravenes the principles upon which the country’s democracy is built. He stressed that Nigerians home and abroad have a right as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution (amended) to express their feelings about the affairs of their country. According to him, the condition of thousands of people who have been displaced from their ancestral homes as a result of herdsmen attacks deserves the attention and support of other Nigerians. He also appreciated the Mutual Union of Tiv in America, as well as other concerned groups for their solidarity, pointing out that the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission was established to cater for the affairs of the country’s citizens living abroad. The Governor commended Hon Mark Gbillah for his calm disposition despite Hon Wase’s utterances and urged the Gwer West representative not to be discouraged from championing causes in the interest of his people. The statement added that ”Ortom expects the House of Representatives to overrule the Deputy Speaker and accept the MUTA petition as well as patriotic concerns of other Nigerians bordering on the state of the nation.” He called on Nigerians in Diaspora Commission to intervene in the matter to prevent a repeat of the ugly scenario in the future.
