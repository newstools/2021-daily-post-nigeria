Chadian President, Idriss Deby has said that Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters are trained in Libya. Deby further hinted that the terrorists get arms and ammunition from the North African country. The Chadian leader spoke to State House correspondents on Saturday at the end of his one-day official visit to Nigeria. The President commended the change of military chiefs and the heads of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF). Deby disclosed that he and Buhari discussed the issue of the challenges terror groups posed to the two countries as well as the Lake Chad environment. He said the resilience of Boko Haram and ISWAP in the Lake Chad Basin has been unprecedented. “They are being supplied, being trained and being formed through Libya. The MNJTF has done a lot of work as you have seen recently. We’ve had exchanges on this with my brother on the way ahead. “With the new team of the Chief of Defence Staff and the new Commander appointed at the Multinational Joint Task Force, I am convinced that we can eradicate Boko Haram,” Deby added.
