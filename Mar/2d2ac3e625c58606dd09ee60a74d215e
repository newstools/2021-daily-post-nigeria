Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation, has warned that the deteriorating security situation in Nigeria could lead to a brutal and bloody civil war. Fani-Kayode gave the warning when he made an appearance on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics. The PDP stalwart believes Nigeria is on the brink of civil war, and only coming together to reason can stop it. According to Fani-Kayode, “It is time for us to come together as a nation in order to avert a civil war. “This country is on the brink of war. The security situation is so bad that it is not just good enough for us to get up and be throwing stones. We have got to proffer solutions to the problems that we are all facing. “This country is divided now, divided into regional, ethnic and religious lines. We can’t run away from that fact. “There’s no point in going on about who is right and who is wrong. It is time for us to come together to talk to one another. “Northerners should talk to Southerners, southerners should talk to northerners, Christians should talk to Muslims, APC should talk to PDP and APGA should be included, and anybody else who’s a leader, every stakeholder in this country must come together because what we’re facing is a situation which might cause a very brutal, bloody civil war.”
