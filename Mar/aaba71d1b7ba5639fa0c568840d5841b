Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has promised to distribute free oil to some countries. Kanu said Biafra would distribute free oil to Ghana, Togo, Benin Republic, Ivory Coast and Gambia when seceded from Nigeria. He explained that the decision was to prove that the secession for Biafra was not for oil or money. Kanu disclosed this in a statement signed by IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful. He stressed that the push for Biafra was borne out of the need to free the entire black race from subjugation. The statement reads: “Kanu equally promised to give free oil and gas to Ghana, Togo, Benin Republic, Ivory Coast, the Gambia and other countries in West Africa and Africa at large. “This is to prove to them that the agitation for Biafra autonomy is not driven by the quest to control oil money. Rather our struggle for self rule is borne out of our desire to set the entire black race free from subjugation. “Biafra wants to have neighbours that are free and peaceful so they can also benefit from our prosperity and enterprise.” Kanu had earlier promised to grant political asylum to Christians in the North when Biafra secedes from Nigeria.
