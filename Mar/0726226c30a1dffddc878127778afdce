Founder and senior Prophet, Christ Mercyland Deliverance Ministries, Jeremiah Fufeyin popularly called Owomowomo, has revived the careers of gospel music artistes, “the Mamuze brothers.” The senior pastor gave out the sum of N2 million as support to the musicians whose careers were wavering. He also prayed for the musicians. Speaking during the donation, Fufeyin, said that greatness is closely related to good deeds in life, adding that people are not remembered for what they possessed or consumed, but what they gave. The church’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Mr Tare Franklin, in a statement said the prophet, whose church is headquartered at Warri, Delta State, is focused on impacting others. Apart from the music stars, the cleric splashed another N10 million on other less privileged persons and those gravely affected by the COVID-19 induced economic hardship in the country. Recall that Fufeyin had claimed that a U.S. based COVID-19 patient, identified as Tyeisha was healed through one of his online miracle church services. Narrating the development in a video made available to journalists, the church’s media representatives said the miracle happened on the 22nd of May 2020, in an interactive online service tagged “Dreams, Interpretations and Solutions (DIS).
