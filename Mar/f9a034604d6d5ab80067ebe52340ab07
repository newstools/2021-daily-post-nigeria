Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has played down reports linking him with Barcelona. According to the Spaniard, he is “privileged and happy” to be with the Gunners. Arteta has been linked with a possible move to Barca this week, with presidential candidate Joan Laporta said to be eyeing him as a possible replacement for Ronald Koeman. When asked about being linked with the Barcelona job, Arteta told reporters on Wednesday: “There is always going to be speculation when there are elections in Barcelona, it’s a huge team. “Obviously I was raised there as a player and there are always going to be links. But I am fully focused on the job that I have to do here, which we have a lot to do, and I am really enjoying it. “Today and tomorrow, I am the manager of Arsenal football club and I am really enjoying it. And I want to do much better than what we have done so far. “What I can tell you is I feel privileged to manage this football club and that I’m extremely happy.”
