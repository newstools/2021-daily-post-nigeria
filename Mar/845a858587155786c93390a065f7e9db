A former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Dr Doyin Okupe has tendered an apology to Igbos for his controversial comment on the 2023 presidential election. Okupe had in a post reported by DAILY POST on Saturday claimed that the Southeast will not produce a president until forgiven by the north for the killing of Ahmadu Bello in 1966. The comment generated backlash on social media, as many on social media criticised the comment. In another post, Okupe apologized for the comments, not just to the Southeast but to the North. The post read “OPEN APOLOGY TO THE IGBOS. I tender my unreserved apology to the Igbos & other Nigerians who felt offended by my post on the Igbo presidency and the north. I never intended to hurt or demean the Igbos. Instead, I wanted 2 help to actualise d dream. I regret d said post, & I am truly sorry,” he tweeted.
