A member of House of Representative, Hon. Femi Bamisile, has urged Nigerians to embrace the COVID-19 vaccination, saying all targeted ages should try to get the vaccination as it is directed. Bamisile, the chairman, House Committee on FERMA, said Nigerians should not ignore the opportunity from the government but for all to know their health status. Hon. Bamisile, representing Ekiti South Federal Constituency 2, gave the advice while donating hospital equipment and empowerment materials worth millions of naira for his constituency. The federal lawmaker urged the entire population to shun the notion that there is no COVID-19 in Nigeria, adding that we need to be very careful of our health status. He pointed out that though the present vaccines that arrived in the country cannot take care of the estimated population of about 200 million of Nigerians, adding that the government was thinking of bringing a supplementary budget to actually fund the vaccine in Nigeria for the population. Bamisile stated that his donation of health facilities to the three local government councils and other empowerment materials was to help the local communities especially the aged and the young to overcome some challenges at the grassroots. The lawmaker added that the effort is to also complement the administration of the Dr. Kayode Fayemi, led government in all the 329 primary health centres across the states for the people.
