The United Nations (UN) has expressed worries over the desert locust invasion in Ethiopia. Several thousands of hectares of cropland have been destroyed, the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said. UNOCHA, in a statement, confirmed that Ethiopia is experiencing its worst desert locust outbreak in 25 years. The agency also hinted at an impending devastating food security and nutrition situation. “The desert locust invasion has so far damaged 365,015 hectares of cropland across multiple regions, devastating crops and livelihoods in at least 76 localities in the country,” it read. The office warned desert locust infestation could persist for the rest of 2021, with incidences of swarms causing damage to crops and pasture. The first wave of locust invasion was detected in late 2019 and has spread to more than 170 localities, home to more than 16 million people. The desert locust, regarded as the most dangerous locust classification, is a major challenge in desert areas across 20 countries.
