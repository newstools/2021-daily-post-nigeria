Mikel Arteta has insisted that Arsenal should have been awarded a spot-kick during their 1-1 against Burnley on Saturday. Firstly, referee Andre Marriner pulls out a red card and sends off Erik Pieters for deliberately blocking Pepe’d shot on the line, he said. After a review by the Video Assistant Ref, it was found that the ball struck the player on the shoulder and VAR overturned it. Arsenal had another penalty appeal when Pieters handled the ball inside his own box but Burnley survived the strong claim by Arsenal. Reacting to the penalty appeal after the game, Arteta told reporters, “If that is not a penalty then someone has to explain to me what is.”
