Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed has said there is evidence that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) defeated President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the 2019 presidential election. APC candidate for the presidential election and incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari was declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Buhari defeated his closest challenger and former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, who was the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The opposition headed to the court after the polls and challenged the results from the tribunal up to the Supreme Court, but could not upturn the victory of Buhari. Bala Mohammed, who was a guest on Channels Television’s Politics Today, on Thursday, alleged that fraud on the part of either the electoral umpire or security operatives cost his party the election. The Governor said that Nigerians are not unaware of what happened during the last general elections, adding that the PDP has learnt its lessons. “The general impression within the party and within the country is that we actually won the election and that we lost to a lot of fraud, to a lot of manipulations that were perpetrated by either the electoral umpire or by the security operatives. “We do not want to be the whipping boys, we have looked inward to see what prevented us from winning the election. We have a lot of evidence, which we tendered but was not accepted. “The issue now is that we know we are all Nigerians. We know the nook and cranny of Nigeria. We know what happened in 2019,” he said.
