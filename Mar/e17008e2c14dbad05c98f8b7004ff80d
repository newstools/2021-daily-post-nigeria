The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, on Tuesday called on the Nigerian Army to take decisive action against controversial Islamic Scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi over his recent remarks on Christian soldiers killing bandits. HURIWA urged the leadership of the Nigeria Army to arrest and prosecute Gumi over his interaction with bandits. The advocacy group asked the Nigerian Army not to lower the bar and never to opt for double standards by issuing a “timid and ridiculous” warning to Gumi whose recent fraternity with terrorists amounts to treason. Recall that the hierarchy of the Nigerian Army had cautioned Gumi and other “opinion merchants” in Nigeria against their utterances and not to drag it into disrepute. The Army had said that it does not deploy troops along religious or ethnic lines, contrary to Gumi’s statements to bandits that it was Christian soldiers killing them. However, the rights group said the failure of the Army to “act decisively to protect the integrity of both military institutions and the war on terror from the persistent treasonous actions and spoken words of Sheikh Gumi, shows that in Nigeria the law is a respecter of certain persons because of their religion and ethnicity.” A statement by HURIWA’s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, reads partly: “Taking practical and law-based action against Sheikh GUMI is the only way the Nigerian Army can demonstrate what it has always been known for as a professional institution whose leadership has always been recognized as constitutional purists.
