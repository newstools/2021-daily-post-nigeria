Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has urged striker, Tammy Abraham, to fight for his place at his squad ahead of their Premier League clash with Liverpool on Thursday. Tuchel left Abraham from Chelsea’s match squad against Manchester United on Sunday solely on selection grounds as both sides played a 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge. The German opted to play Olivier Giroud to lead Chelsea’s attack line against Man United ahead of the England international. The former Paris Saint-Germain has now called on Abraham to accept the situation and work to force his way back into contention in the Blues’ squad. “This situation is totally natural, he [Tammy Abraham] has to do exactly what he does; train well, be in a good mood and accept that he is a striker for Chelsea, so this is the highest competition in Europe,” Tuchel was quoted by Sportsmole as saying. “When you play for Chelsea, it is a difficult decision I have to take, and I am very, very happy when I have to take them because it means everybody is on board. “This is what you sign up for if you are a player for Chelsea, a coach for Chelsea, when these moments arrive. “There is no other answer to it other than to accept it and be there on Monday to fight for your place in the squad. I am sure he will do it.” Abraham’s current contract with Chelsea will expire in 2023.
