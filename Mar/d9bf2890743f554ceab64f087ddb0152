Tuchel said this after Chelsea defeated Sheffield United 2-0 in the FA Cup quarter-final tie on Sunday. According to him, Mendy will remain at Stamford Bridge because he has an operation on his tooth. The German noted that the Senegalese goalkeeper needs to see a dentist. “Edou Mendy will stay because he has an operation on his tooth,” Tuchel told a post-match press conference while providing an update on his squad ahead of the international break. “He needs to see the dentist because it needs to be done. It’s why we do it now.” Chelsea’s next match is against West Brom on April 3 after the international break.
