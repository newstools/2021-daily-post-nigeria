Chelsea midfielder, N’Golo Kante, has admitted he turned down the chance to work with Thomas Tuchel at Paris Saint-Germain. Kante, a two-time Premier League champion, became a target for PSG. However, he opted to continue his stay in the Premier League with the Blues. When asked by Chelsea’s official website about being a target for Tuchel in the past, Kante said: “I knew in the past there was some contact with Paris Saint-Germain when he was the manager, but it was not something I wanted. “It did not happen because I was happy at Chelsea and I stayed here. I haven’t spoken to the manager about it!” Kante will be in action on Thursday night when they take on champions Liverpool at Anfield.
