The Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, has declared that the All Progressives Congress, APC, would take over the six states of the South-South in 2023. Omo-Agege made the declaration while speaking with journalists on Saturday in Asaba, Delta State. The Deputy Senate President noted that the South South was fast becoming a formidable base for the APC. “The South-South region is growing to become a formidable base of our great party. “By the end of the 2023 general elections, it is our aspiration to have in our column, control of all the six states in the region. “This is possible and we intend to make it happen,’’ Omo-Agege said. He noted that APC was determined and has what it takes to make it happen. Omo-Agege noted that APC won the governorship elections in some states in the South South but was robbed. “We won in Bayelsa and Bayelsa was clearly ours but we were deprived, using the instrument of the court in the last minute. “We won in Edo but for obvious reasons, we were also deprived,” he said.
