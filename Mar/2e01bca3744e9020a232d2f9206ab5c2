The Osun State Police Command, on Tuesday, dragged an 18-year-old secondary school student of Oduduwa College, Ile-Ife, before a Magistrateâ€™s Court, for allegedly assaulting his teacher and the security guard of his school. The student, Salami Lateef, on Monday, March 1, allegedly stormed his school and beat up his teacher and a security personnel guarding his school. It was said that the accused student threw stones, pebbles and broken glasses of the windows of the school building during the assault. The Police Prosecutor, ASP Sunday Osanyintuyi, told the court that the defendant conspired with others now at large to commit the offence. According to him, the defendant assaulted one CPL Aderibigbe Emmanuel by beating and stoning him when he was performing his legal duty as a member of Nigerian Legion Security outfit guarding the school. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to a three-count charge of conspiracy and malicious damage leveled against him. The Defence Counsel, Nicholas Babatunde, applied for the bail of the defendant in most liberal terms and pledged that his client would not jump bail. In his ruling, Magistrate A. A. Adebayo granted the accused student bail in the sum of N100,000 with two sureties in like sum. The case was, however, adjourned till March 18, for hearing.
