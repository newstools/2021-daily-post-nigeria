Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State says all is set for the commissioning of the newly- constructed ultra-modern Tor Tiv Palace and road projects in Gboko on April 8, 2021. The governor made the disclosure on Thursday while briefing journalists shortly after inspecting the Palace and other completed projects such as Gyado Junction-Gyado White House- Ministry of Agriculture and Shaahu roads. He expressed satisfaction with the quality of work done on the Palace, describing it as befitting for the Tiv Paramount ruler. The Governor, who had earlier inspected ongoing work on Tse-Poor – Apir and Igbor-Ikpa-mbatyerev- Wannune roads expressed his displeasure on the slow pace and poor quality of work on the Igbor Wannune road and directed the Commissioner of Works to communicate to the contractors. The Governor also directed the State Commissioner for Housing to initiate a memo to convert Governor’s Lodges in the various local Government Areas to palaces for First Class Chiefs, pointing out that where none exists, new ones would be constructed. Governor Ortom,who interacted with the Tor Tiv, First Class Chiefs and other traditional rulers, received royal blessings during the meeting, having been blessed earlier by the Tor Tiv’s wife, Dr Mrs Felicia Ayatse and other mothers at the Palace. Tor Tiv, Professor James Ayatse commended the Governor for constructing such an “edifice as Palace which is one of the best for any traditional ruler in the country”, stressing that he would continue to enjoy their royal blessings.
