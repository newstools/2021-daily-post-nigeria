The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) said the South-West region has the highest rate of drug use in Nigeria. The Chairman, Buba Marwa, disclosed this on Friday during the inauguration of a Behavioural Action Care Foundation Centre in Ogbomoso. The retired general vowed that the agency will continue its crackdown on all sources of illicit substances in the country. “We will deny their exportation, we will seize them when we find them and will destroy them.” Marwa noted that 14.4 percent of Nigerians between the ages of 16 to 64 use drugs. The chairman said the prevalence in Oyo State is 23 percent, while Kano State has a prevalence of 16 percent. “The South-West has the worst prevalence. The prevalence is 22.4 percent”, NAN quoted him as saying. In other Southern regions, the prevalence in South-South is 16.6 percent and South-East 14.8 percent. North-East has a prevalence of 18.6 percent, North-West 12 percent and North-Central 10 percent. Marwa appealed to parents, guardians and other stakeholders to always demand a drug-free certificate as a requisite for marriage and engagements/programmes.
