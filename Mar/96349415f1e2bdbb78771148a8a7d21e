A 37-year-old married woman and a mother of two children has died during an alleged sex romp with her secret lover identified as Lekan Agboola in Yola, the capital of Adamawa State. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Nguroje who confirmed the incident to reporters in the state, said the command had arrested the suspect (the lover). According to the PPRO, Agboola who is currently being detained at the command’s criminal investigation Department, also has a wife and two children, living in Lagos. While confessing to the crime, Agboola said, “On February 24, 2021, around 9am, I called her on the phone and asked her to see me because we had not seen each other for some time.” According to him, the woman collapsed while they were both having fun in his apartment. ‘’When I realised she was not breathing, I then called one of my female friends and told her what happened. She advised me to take her to a hospital where she was confirmed dead,” he added. DSP Nguroje, however, said investigation into the case is currently ongoing, adding that the actual cause of death would soon be unveiled.
