Residents of Gbodofon and Awosuru areas of Osogbo have bemoaned the sudden influx of business owners and businesses in their abode. The influx started with the decision of the state government to construct a flyover at Olaiya Junction, a situation that led most businesses to relocate to newer locations. Residents complained that prior to the economic invasion, their area was noted as one of the most peaceful and orderly locations within Osogbo the state capital but that the peace of the area has been shattered because of development. They said the noise pollution from uncontrolled commercial activities is starting to affect their daily living. Kabir Jamiu, a resident said that under normal circumstances, these businesses are supposed to obtain permission before setting up shop since their present location was never intended for commercial activities. He also noted that the spaces occupied by the business owners are the major roads, being the Gbongan-Ibadan portion of the road, adding that this development would disrupt the smooth flow of traffic. Refuse generation and disposal is another problem that will come up as a result of businesses relocating to this area, Ajoke Saliu, complained. She explained that to tackle the challenge, the traders must ensure that they clean everywhere before and after business and always maintain the sanitation days. Already, traffic congestion is a daily occurrence as observed by DAILY POST on a visit to both areas today. Meanwhile, commercial motorcyclists operating within the axis have decried the operations of local government levy collectors. They said the levy collectors have seized the opportunity of traffic diversions along the government designated routes to block and extort them unnecessarily. According to them, every time they make use of the roads, they are charged, which was not so before the government announced the construction of the Olaiya flyover.
