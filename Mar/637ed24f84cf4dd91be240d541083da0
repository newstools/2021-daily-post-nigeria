Leicester City striker, Kelechi Iheanacho, has finally arrived at the Super Eagles camp, ahead of their 2022 AFCON qualifiers against the Benin Republic and Lesotho. Iheanacho, who is currently in hot-form for the Foxes, arrived at the Super Eagles camp on Wednesday. His late arrival was due to a mix-up in his flight itinerary. This was confirmed on the Super Eagles verified Twitter handle on Wednesday morning. This means all 24 players invited for the Benin and Lesotho fixtures are now in camp for the two qualifiers. Gernot Rohrâ€™s men will travel to Cotonou on Friday for their matchday five clash against Benin in Porto Novo on Saturday. The three-time African champions will also tackle Lesotho next week Tuesday in Lagos.
