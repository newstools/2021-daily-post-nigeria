The National Youths Service Corps, NYSC, has banned about eight foreign universities in the Republic of Benin and Niger from participating in the 2021 Batch A orientation course. Most of the banned universities are said to be awarding degrees to students a few months after matriculation. Although the NYSC management did not provide enough reasons for its decision, its circular (dated Friday, March 5 2021) to state/FCT coordinators, informed all D&R and foreign-trained verification officers in states to take note of the under listed schools.
