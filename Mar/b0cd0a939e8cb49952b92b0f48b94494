No fewer than four kidnapped victims in Zamfara State have regained their freedom from the bandits operating in the state. According to the victims, they were kidnapped at Boko community in Zurmi Local Government Area of the state. They revealed that they were in the bandits’ den for 49 days before they were released through the effort of the state government. Asked if they were released without ransom as the state government claims, the kidnapped victims said they could not exactly say whether the government paid ransom to the bandits or not, saying that all they know is that they have been released. Receiving the victims at the chamber of the Government House in Gusau, the state capital, Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle said that the victims were released without ransom. The Governor noted that their release was made possible due to the peace and reconciliation process initiated by his administration. He further urged the unrepentant bandits to embrace the current peace accord and reconciliation process which he initiated with the aim of restoring peace in the state. According to him, many prominent people in the state are involved in banditry activities, saying that the issue is becoming uncontrollable in the state. It could be recalled that a few days ago, the Governor swore with the Holy Qur’an, asking General Aliyu Gusau, Yarima, former Governor, Mahmud a Aliyu Shinkafi and others to come out and swear publicly that they have no hand in the banditry ravaging the state.
