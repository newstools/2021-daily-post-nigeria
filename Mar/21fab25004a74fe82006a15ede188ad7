The National Leader of the APC, Senator Ahmad Bola Tinubu, has hit the Government of President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly below the belts, saying Nigeria is favourably competing with bandits in recruiting the youths. Tinubu who spoke at his 25th colloquium to celebrate his 69th Birthday in Kano said the government needs to urgently recruit about 50 million youths into the Nigeria Army and the Police. He said, “what do they require to be trained is food yams, cassava and other available foods, therefore something must urgently be done to salvage the country”. Tinubu noted that it was time to put stimulus expenditure in place stressing that the government must reconstruct the economy. He said, “Nigerians are fed up with fastings, we are fasting no more while you asking us to keep on fasting, we are fasting no more”, he insisted. The National Leader of the APC said the government must restrict unbalanced projects and that sovereign power must be used to progress and develop the country. “But as it is today Nigeria is under Police, the nation is competing with the bandits to recruit the youths, 33 percent are redundant doing nothing, why don’t you recruit 50 million into the Nigeria Army and Police”, he quarried. He said to the bandits, “Don’t talk about illiteracy, anybody who can handle a gun, cock it and put the chambers and fire can as well repairs tractors in the farms”.
