Azman Air is running into distress due to the suspension by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). The airline announced a halt in operations due to a safety audit by the NCAA. This followed the sanction by the regulator after a management meeting on Monday. NCAA Director-General Captain Musa Nuhu, explained that the decision followed a series of events involving the airline’s Boeing 737 aircraft. Nuhu said it was pursuant to Section 35 (2) of the Civil Aviation Act, 2006, and Part 1.3.3.3 (A) of the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig.CARs) 2015. An airline official told PRNigeria that the airline operates within established rules and complies with aviation standards. “1,000 staff on the airline have been affected. We are not sure of what will happen if this suspension remains”, he said. The NCAA is conducting an audit of Azman to determine the root causes of recorded incidents and will recommend corrective actions.
