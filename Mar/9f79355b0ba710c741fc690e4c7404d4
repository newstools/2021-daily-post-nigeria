European football clubs are looking at new rules that would ban Champions League sides from selling players to each other. The Idea was raised by Andrea Agnelli, the chairman of the European Clubs Association, following the organisation’s 25th General Assembly. Agnelli, who is also the chairman of Juventus, said that this creates a more competitive balance in European football. Answering a question following the ECA meeting about salary caps, Agnelli talked about finding alternative ways to secure financial fair play within football. “Clubs qualifying to specific tiers in international competitions would not be allowed to buy each other’s players. “That would improve indirect solidarity towards other clubs. So, no triple figure transfers among Champions League participating clubs. These are elements we are discussing,” he said.
