President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday reiterated his earlier order to shoot anyone found illegally with AK-47. Buhari said he has given security chiefs a marching order to go harder on criminals, including to shoot anyone found illegally with AK-47. The President spoke at a meeting with the National Council of Traditional Rulers of Nigeria at the State House, co-chaired by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar III and the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi and was contained in a statement by his spokesman, Femi Adesina. ‘‘But what surprises is what is happening now in the North West where the same people, with the same culture are killing each other, taking their livestock and burning properties. ‘‘As a result of that, we had a four-hour meeting of the National Security Council attended by the Ministers of Internal Affairs, Defence, Foreign Affairs, Service Chiefs, Chief of Defence Staff, the Inspector-General of Police and others and we gave clear instructions. ‘‘One thing that got to the press which I read myself was that anyone with an AK-47 will be shot. ‘‘This is because AK-47 is supposed to be registered and it is only given to security officials. ‘‘We closed the borders for some years but the intelligence report I’m getting on a daily basis is that those who are conducting the abductions, the killings and so on are still not short of arms and ammunition,’’ he said.
