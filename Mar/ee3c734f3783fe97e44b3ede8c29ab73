Kelechi Francis, has said that the company will end the ongoing Easter promo sale of their low cost Estate plots located at Jiwako, Karu Local Government Area of Nassarawa State, near Abacha Barracks, Abuja on or before the 31st of March 2021. The MD, who assured that the company will continue to leave up to its name, narrated that the name “SME” was carefully chosen to give Nigerians a stress-free, money-saving and easy-to-get property. He, however, vowed that the company will not entertain any reservation call from anybody as the sale will continue to be based on first come, first served. The price for a plot is 7million naira but there could be a discount for those who may need more than one.
