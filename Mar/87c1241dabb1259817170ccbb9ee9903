The Niger State Government has announced the outbreak of avian influenza (flu) in a cluster of poultry farms amidst the coronavirus pandemic in the State. The Information Officer, Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, Mr Abubakar Kuta, stated this in a statement made available to newsmen on Thursday in Minna, NAN reports. Kuta said that poultry in the state were being infected by type A flu. According to him, thousands of birds in the state, worth millions of naira, had been lost to the flu. He advised poultry farmers to be vigilant and to report any incident of sudden high mortality of their birds to the ministry. The Information officer urged farmers to maintain strict farm hygiene, restrict movement of vehicles and people into their farms. “We advise that farmers should always disinfect farm premises and utensils to check the transmission of the virus. “Also, they should avoid the exchange of egg crates and other equipment from other farms. “The public and livestock marketers are equally advised to minimise contacts with sick and dead birds,” the statement said. Recall that the Philippines also recorded an outbreak of avian flu in a northern province in March. This was after tests showed the presence of the highly infectious H5N6 subtype in a quail farm.
