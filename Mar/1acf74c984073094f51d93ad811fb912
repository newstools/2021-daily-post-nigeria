Shehu Sani has reacted to Tuesday’s attack on a traditional ruler, Emir of Birnin Gwari in Kaduna by bandits. DAILY POST reported earlier that suspected bandits on Tuesday attacked the Emir of Birnin Gwari, Alhaji Zubairu Jibril Maigwari while he was travelling along the Kaduna-Abuja expressway. A number of persons were said to have been injured in the attack when the bandits shot at the emir’s convoy, destroying his vehicles with bullets. The emir is said to be one of the top traditional rulers who held a virtual meeting with the state governor, Nasir El-Rufai, only last week when the recurring crisis on banditry ravaging the state was discussed. Reacting to the attack, Sani, a former federal lawmaker and member of the 8th assembly, said, “The morning attack on the Convoy of the Emir of Birnin Gwari, Kaduna State by Bandits is tragic. “But we give thanks to Allah that he was reportedly not in the vehicle. Our prayers go to his staff.”
