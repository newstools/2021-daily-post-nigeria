The ousted Majority Leader of the Imo House of Assembly, Uche Ogbuagu (APC – Ikeduru), has called for calm. The Speaker, Paul Emeziem (APC – Onuimo), announced his removal on Thursday. He announced Kanayo Njoku (APC-Owerri West) as the new Majority Leader. The Speaker noted that the decision was taken at a caucus meeting of the party. Ogbuagu, in a statement published by NAN, called Emeziem’s action “comic”. The lawmaker wondered why the letter he wrote to the House leadership on Wednesday was disregarded. “I am surprised that the Speaker, Mr Paul Emeziem, decided to discountenance my letter to him yesterday, dated March 3, 2021 and read his ‘Comic letter of Removal’. “There have been bombardment of calls and SMS to my phone lines by concerned Imolites and Houses across the globe to confirm the incidence.” Ogbuagu said he was studying the development and would consult with the party’s leadership.
