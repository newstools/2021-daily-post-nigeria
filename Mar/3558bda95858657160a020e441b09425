Arsenal midfielder, Mohammed Elneny, has rejected the Egypt coach, Hossam El Badry’s request for him to warm-up at half-time during their African Cup of Nations qualifying game against Kenya. The Arsenal star went ahead to tell the national team coach that he would not play and demanded that he be not invited to the team again. The 28 year-old was frustrated with the coach’s decision not to field him in the starting line-up, hence his refusal to come on as a substitute. Elneny remains as one of the biggest names of the Egypt squad despite that he does not play regularly for the Gunners. El Badry was said to have overlooked the Premier League star after promising to start him in the game. “After the first training camp under Hossam El-Badry, Elneny asked not to be called up again, because he wasn’t starting,” Egyptian journalist, Ahmed Abdelbaset told OnTime Sport TV. “He was constantly on the bench during the previous qualifying matches, and even though he was promised to start he was still benched against Kenya. “El-Badry asked Elneny to warm-up during the half-time because he was planning on subbing him on but he refused and told him he wasn’t going to play,” he added.
