The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned the murder of the elder brother of Senator Gabriel Suswam, Terkula Suswam, by suspected gunmen. DAILY POSY reports that Suswam and one of his aides were murdered Tuesday night in front of his house in Anyiin, Logo LGA of Benue State. Reacting, the PDP in a statement by National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan on Wednesday, called on security agencies to go after and apprehend the killers. The statement said, “The party charges the Inspector General of Police to swing into action, unearth all those connected to the dastardly act and ensure that none of those involved escaped the long arm of the law.” The statement described Suswam as a brilliant academician, who was contributing to the development of his state adding that his killers cannot justify their act under any guise. “Our party condoles with Benue state Governor, Samuel Ortom, Senator Gabriel Suswam and the entire Suswam family and prayed God to grant the Suswan family the grace to bear the loss,” the statement said.
