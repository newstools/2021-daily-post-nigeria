Manchester United striker, Marcus Rashford has identified Chelsea forward Tammy Abraham as the best player in the Blues squad. The England International stated this during a question-and-answer session on Twitter yesterday. The young United striker was asked to identify his favourite current player in the Chelsea set up and his answer was “Abraham.” Rashford chose Abraham despite the abundance of talents within Chelsea’s ranks and the other English stars at Stamford Bridge. Abraham has been enduring a difficult time at Chelsea recently and has not played for the team since a 1-1 draw with Southampton on the 20th of February. Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has omitted Abraham entirely from the matchday squad to face Rashford’s Manchester United the following weekend. This has heightened the rumour of the Nigerian-born England International’s exit from Stamford Bridge.
