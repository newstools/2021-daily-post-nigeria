Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has admitted he “would take” Cristiano Ronaldo in his side, even as speculation mount over his future at Juventus. The Serie A giants were dumped out of the Champions League against Porto last week, raising fresh questions over Ronaldo’s future. The 36-year-old is on a huge salary and Juve are considering trying to move him on in the summer because of their current financial position, according to reports in Italy. It was claimed last week that Jorges Mendes, who acts as Ronaldo’s agent, offered the player back to Manchester United last summer. When asked the question in a Q&A on the United website, Solskjaer replied: “There’s a few players I have played with that I would love to have in my team, of course. “I’d love the player Roy Keane, I’m not sure if I could manage him though. I’d sign him every day of the week. Roy was so influential. But then again, I played with Cristiano [Ronaldo] and he has been the best player in the world alongside Messi for the past 10-15 years now, so Cristiano. “You’d take him in your team, for sure.”
