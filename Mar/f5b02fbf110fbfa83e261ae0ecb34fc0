A medical doctor based in the United Kingdom, Dr. Reuben Obaro and wife, Mrs. Ayodele Obaro on Tuesday, dragged the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) before a federal high court over what they termed malicious trial on corruption. The couple had been arraigned on an eighth count charge bordering on corruption, misappropriation amongst others but Justice Anthony Ebong of a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) dismissed the case. The judge dismissed the ICPC case against the couple with the ruling that the commission acted in bad faith in filing the charges against the renowned medical practitioners. After dragging the commission to the Federal High Court in Abuja court on Tuesday, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu fixed May 25 for mention of their suit against ICPC. The judge fixed the date for mention following confirmation that the fifth defendant in the matter has not been served with the court processes. When the matter was called, plaintiff’s counsel, Professor Joachim Amupitan, SAN informed the court that the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and three other defendants have been served with writ of summons and other processes on February 24, 2021. The senior lawyer however added that the fifth defendant was yet to be served and that he will take steps to do the needful. However before granting adjournment into the master, the Judge drew Amupitan’s attention to the fact that the writ of summons was issued out on December 17, 2020 and will become invalid if not served by March 17, 2021 as stipulated by law. The judge subsequently fixed May 25 for the report of service on the fifth defendant and for the mention of the suit.
