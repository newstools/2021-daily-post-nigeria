The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Ogun State Chapter, has threatened that it would shut down all tertiary institutions of learning should the government fail to rescue two female university students kidnapped on Sunday night. DAILY POST reported on Monday that two female students of Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ayetoro campus in Yewa-North Local Government Area of Ogun State, Adeyemo Precious and Oyefule Abiola, were kidnapped by unknown gunmen, who have reportedly demanded N50 million ransom. The police confirmed the incident to DAILY POST on Monday, saying they were on top of the situation. Reacting in a statement made available to DAILY POST, the NANS Chairman in Ogun State, Damilola Simeon, strongly condemned the incident, describing it as unfortunate. Claiming that over 1,157 Nigerian students have fallen victims of kidnapping in the last seven years, Simeon accused the Federal and the Ogun State Government of “silence and dormancy”. He said the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies were not taking actions. “We call on the state government as a responsible and responsive government to speedily see to the quick, safe and sound rescue of Adeyemo Precious and Oyefule Abiola from the hands of these monsters. “We will give the government the benefit of the doubt for four days after which we will no longer watch our students become relegated to mere pawns. “Failure of the government to emancipate these students within four days will lead to the total shutdown of tertiary academic activities in the state. “We call on President Muhammadu Buhari and Prince Dapo Abiodun as the Chief Security Officers of Nigeria and Ogun State, respectively, to instantly crush the menace and see to the rapid release of Adeyemo Precious and Oyefule Abiola,” the statement read partly.
