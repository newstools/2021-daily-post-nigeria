Paris Saint-Germain could have Neymar available, for the second leg of their Champions League last-16 clash with Barcelona next Wednesday. Neymar has been left out of the squad to play Brest in the Coupe de France on Saturday. But he has returned to partial training and manager Mauricio Pochettino is “very happy” with his recovery. Neymar has not played for PSG since suffering an injury in the 1-0 cup win over Caen on February 10 and missed out as they beat his former side 4-1 at Camp Nou. Speaking in a press conference on Friday, PSG coach Pochettino said: “He will not be here tomorrow but we are very happy with his development and we will see in the days to come if he can be part of the squad against Barcelona.”
