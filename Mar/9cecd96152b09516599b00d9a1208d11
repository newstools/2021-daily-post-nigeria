Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, has restated that his administration would not negotiate with bandits. El-Rufai during a meeting of the State Security Council held at the Council Chambers of Sir Kashim Ibrahim House in Kaduna on Tuesday. The governor stated that his job as a governor was to enforce the law and help to prosecute people who commit offences. “We will not engage with bandits or kidnappers. Private citizens like clerics and clergymen can do so in their individual capacities, to preach to them and ask them to repent. “We also want them to repent but it is not our job to ask them to do so,’’ he said. The governor also said the panacea to the persistent farmer-herder clashes, cattle rustling and banditry was for nomadic herdsmen to live more sedentary lives. He said sedentary life would help nomads to be more productive and give their children education and access to better healthcare. This is coming at a time bandits had abducted students and teachers at a primary school in the state.
