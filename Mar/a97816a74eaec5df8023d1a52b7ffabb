Cross River State Youth Success Institute (CRSYSI) has condemned a statement credited to Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State where he claimed not to be a 419 Governor like others whose budgets run into trillions of naira. The group noted that Wike’s approach was destructive and a calculated attempt to snare Governor Ayade and Cross River people. Addressing newsmen in Calabar, the Executive Director of the group, Awatt Caleb Ekpenyong criticised the utterances accredited to Wike saying it was venomous and a campaign of calumny against Governor Ayade. “In a bid not to appear impertinent, we venture as civil citizens under the guise of Cross River State Youth Success Institute (CRSYSI) and it’s allied youth organizations and stakeholders to condemn in its entirety: the venom, arrogance and campaign of calumny unleashed by Governor Ezenwo Nyesom Wike of Rivers State on the Executive Governor of Cross River State. “One would ordinarily ignore Governor Wike’s public utterances if it were meant as a corrective program in the effort to build a virile, stable society for the present. “Obviously, Wike’s approach is destructive and calculated to snare the Governor of Cross River State and its people. Although no society is not without its peculiarity, Cross River State cannot be run through the Governor of Rivers State. He has no such authority. Neither has the constitution made such provision. To think otherwise tantamount to plans of annexation, ambition a parochialism. “Wike should be reminded that Ayade is the Executive Governor Cross River State who enjoys the full mandate of the people of the State”. The group warned Wike to leave Cross River State alone saying that Governor Ayade is visionary and can lead the state to its desired shore of happiness.
