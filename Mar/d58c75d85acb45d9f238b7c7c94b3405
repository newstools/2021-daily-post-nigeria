Watford striker, Troy Deeney, has picked Manchester United’s Aaron Wan-Bissaka as a better right-back than Chelsea’s Reece James and Manchester City’s Kyle Walker. Deeney believes Wan-Bissaka should be included in England’s European Championship squad rather than James or Walker this summer. England manager, Gareth Southgate, said he has a major decision to make at the right-back, where he has several excellent options. The likes of Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold and Atletico Madrid’s Kieran Trippier are also in contention. Speaking on Talksport, Deeney said Wan-Bissaka should get the nod ahead of others, adding that James should not have been in England’s current squad. “It’s not personal, just an opinion; I don’t think Reece James goes over Wan-Bissaka. I don’t think he should have been in this squad over Wan-Bissaka,” Deeney said “He doesn’t always start for Chelsea. That’s the main one (reason). But I just think Wan-Bissaka is so good defensively. “You can say what you want about him (Wan-Bissaka) with the ball, but when it comes to the nitty-gritty, you are going to need someone who will clamp down on their winger, know his role, do his job, get the ball and give it to the better players – that is what you need in those situations. “I would back him (Wan-Bissaka) or Kyle Walker because he’s so fast. But I’d have Wan-Bissaka.”
