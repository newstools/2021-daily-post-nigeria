Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has said that Ahmed Musa is not in the 23-man squad he called up to prosecute the qualifying matches against Benin Republic and Lesotho later this month. He said that the clubless Musa was not invited as a player but as the captain of the team, adding that the former Leicester City forward will not play. After terminating his contract with Saudi Arabian Al-Nassr, Musa has been without a club. Musa was a surprise inclusion in Gernot Rohr’s 24-man provisional team list released yesterday by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). Rohr told Leadership Sports that the former CSKA Moscow striker would play no part in the last two group games. “He is not in the list of 23-man but he is invited like a captain, not like a player of the list,” Rohr said. The Eagles gaffer, however, assured Nigerian football fans to expect good football and qualification tickets to the 2021 AFCON finals. “Nigerians should expect good football and qualifications for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations,” he concluded. Nigeria needs just one point from the two matches to book their place in the African Cup of Nations, AFCON, in Cameroon next year.
