A woman, Sukurat Olajoke, has narrated to the Ogun State Police Command how she killed her one-month-old baby girl and threw her body into the Ogun River in Abeokuta. The 35-year-old mother said she killed the baby out of frustration. The Ogun Police Spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST on Sunday that Olajoke was arrested by policemen attached to Enugada divisional headquarters, Abeokuta. It was said that while the police were on routine patrol with the DPO, SP Baba Hamzat, they “saw the woman throwing something suspicious into the river.” Oyeyemi disclosed that “the suspicious behaviour of the woman, after throwing the object into the river, attracted the policemen who quickly apprehended her for questioning.” During interrogation, the suspect, a resident of Agboole Alakoye area of Igbo Ora in Oyo State, “confessed that what she threw into the river was the corpse of her one-month-old baby, who she killed out of frustration.” The woman was quoted as saying that “the person who is responsible for the pregnancy of the baby, rejected her and the baby and since she had no means of taking care of the child, she decided to kill and throw her into the river.” The police said its preliminary investigation had revealed that the suspect is a mother of six other children owned by three different fathers. She was impregnated by another man simply identified as Hakeem, who refused to accept the paternity of the child, DAILY POST learnt. “The DPO engaged the services of local divers, who helped in recovering the corpse of the child and it has been deposited at the general hospital mortuary,” Oyeyemi said, adding that the woman would be transferred to the homicide section as ordered by the Commissioner of Police, CP Edward Awolowo Ajogun.
