The unknown gunmen, who kidnapped a chieftain of All Progressives Congress, (APC) in Cross River State, Mr Dominic Aqua Edem, have demanded N50m ransom. DAILY POST gathered that the abductors got in touch with the family on Sunday and commenced negotiation for his release. As of the time of filing this report, negotiation was still on but the family members pleaded that much should not be made public until the man is released. Our source declined further comment but noted that Mr Edem, a lawyer, was a two-time member of the Cross River State House of Assembly representing Bakassi State Constituency and that he had been kidnapped twice. “He was a member representing Cross River on the board of Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC. He was kidnapped in his farm in his village in Ifiang, in Bakassi local government area,” the source said. DAILY POST gathered that the victim was kidnapped in 2015 when he contested for the House of Representatives for Bakassi/Akpabuyo/Calabar South federal constituency and was released after ransom was paid. The Deputy Police Public Relations Officer in the State, Igri Ewa had confirmed the abduction, but said the police were making efforts to rescue the victim.
