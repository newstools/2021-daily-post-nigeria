Nigeria could seal their place at next year’s Africa Cup of Nations today, when they take on Benin Republic in Porto Novo. Gernot Rohr’s men are top of Group L with 8 points, one more than the Squirrels in second place. In the reverse fixture, the Super Eagles won 2-1, thanks to goals from Victor Osimhen and Samuel Kalu. Unbeaten in their last three games, Michel Dussuyer’s team would fancy their chances against Nigeria, as they themselves are on a quest to qualify for the fifth time. The game is scheduled to kick off 5pm West African time. According to Goal, the match will be beamed live on AIT and NTA. The Eagles will then host Lesotho in four days at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos.
