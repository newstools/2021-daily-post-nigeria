The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said President Muhammadu Buhari would never condone looters of public funds within and outside government. John Akpan Udoedehe, National Secretary of the Caretaker Committee (CECPC) stated this on Wednesday. His reaction followed Peoples Democratic Party’s description of the Buhari administration as the most corrupt government in Nigeria. Udoedehe, in a rejoinder, noted that the opposition has laboured to canvass tales of a phantom stolen N15trillion public funds. The scribe dared the PDP to back its allegations with facts, adding that the party was known for “pervasive corruption and impunity”. The scribe said the PDP engaged in petroleum subsidy rackets, unexecuted electricity, road and arms contracts, misappropriation and diversion of public funds. “The most ardent critics of President Buhari and the government he leads will definitely chorus one fact: this government is unsparing and does not condone thieves within and outside government.” APC listed the implementation of Treasury Single Account, Biometric Verification Number (BVN) and the Whistle-Blowing policy as initiatives the administration use in the fight against. Udoedehe boasted that “no government in the country’s history has put in place measures to create jobs and alleviate poverty” like the Buhari government. The secretary said the N2.3 trillion Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) had not only stimulated the economy but prevented business collapse. He further cited the N75billion National Youth Investment Fund (NYIF) and the Micro Small Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Survival Fund which included Payroll Support for businesses in health, education, hospitality and food production sectors.
