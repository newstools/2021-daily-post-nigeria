Residents of Nsukka town in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State have complained about the cost of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS). PMS, also known petrol, sold between N220 and N225 per litre in filing stations on Friday. Citizens told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that many outlets were not dispensing fuel. Dr. Ifeanyichukwu Abada, a senior lecturer in the Department of Political Science, University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN), said that he bought a litre at N225. Abada, forrmer Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Universities in UNN, advised the government to consider stop regular increment. “Any increase in price of petrol always leads to increase in prices of products and services in the country,” he said. Chidi Onah, a lawyer, expressed concern that the increase in petrol price had become a monthly affair. “In February, the price was N187. I bought a litre this morning in filing station at N223. I stayed over 45 minutes in a queue because few stations in Nsukka town are selling,” he said. Desmond Eze, a tricycle operator, said the normal rate per passenger was N50 within Nsukka town. He said with N225 per litre, operators will have to increase transport fare so as to remain in business. An independent petroleum marketer said he was selling a litre for N225 in his station because he didn’t know what it would cost him to get new supply. The Petroleum Products Pricing Regulation Agency (PPPRA) latest template released on Thursday showed at a litre would cost between N209 to N212 for March. The agency has denied its own publication.
