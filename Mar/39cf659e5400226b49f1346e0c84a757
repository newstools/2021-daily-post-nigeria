An All Progressives Congress Chieftain, Chukwuemeka Eze, has said that those contemplating peace moves with Magnus Abe and Igo Aguma are enemies of the Minister of Transport, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi. He has asked such persons to reconsider their decisions of intervening. Former Senator Abe and Igo Aguma have been at loggerheads with Rotimi Amaechi over the control of the soul of the All Progressive Congress, APC, in Rivers State. In a statement made available to DAILY POST on Monday, Eze said he called for a rethink because such moves would not produce positive results as the former lawmaker is allegedly a mere messenger working for powerful overlords. The ex-PDP national spokesman said negotiating with the overlords would be far easier to get a better outcome. Eze, a close associate of the Transportation Minister, suggested that every negotiation be directed towards the overlords and not to Abe who acts only at the master’s command. According to the Party Chieftain, “this struggle has gone beyond Abe and his cohorts as they are just mere pawns in the hands of very powerful internal and external forces, so those who are contemplating any peace move with Abe should rather have a rethink as the former lawmaker is but a mere fief working for a powerful overlord”. “All efforts made by both Amaechi and the party to appease Abe since 2015 even till now have proved abortive as he is hell-bent to ensure that APC doesn’t exist in Rivers State in obedience to those sponsoring him. So, I sympathize with those who are thinking of canvassing peace with Abe who has gone so far in their devilish mission”. Eze said, “every negotiation should be channelled to the overlords and not a poor servant who acts only at the master’s command; as the saying goes, he who pays the piper detects the tone”. “If not, then the way out is to show them the exit door, continue dancing with them in the Court until they are formally disgraced or President Buhari intervenes”.
