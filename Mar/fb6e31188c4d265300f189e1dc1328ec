Kano Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, on Monday, condemned the attack on his Benue counterpart, Samuel Ortom. He spoke to reporters after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House in Abuja. The Governor stated that the incident and insecurity in the country were alarming. Ganduje said Buhari desired a safe nation and that he believed with appointment of new service chiefs, a new strategy will be developed. “Not only governors being attacked…anybody who is attacked in Nigeria, one should be worried because life is life. “We’ are worried because a governor is supposed to have some security with him, let alone an ordinary man who has no security,” he noted. Ganduje, who described the situation as “serious” and “unfortunate”, expressed hope that Nigeria’s challenges would be surmounted. Christian leaders have also asked security agencies to investigate the attack on Ortom, arrest and prosecute the masterminds.
