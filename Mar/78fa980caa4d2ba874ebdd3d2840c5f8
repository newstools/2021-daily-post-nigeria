A High Court 1 sitting in Kogi State has sentenced one Ocholi Edicha to 12 years and 6 months in prison for the gruesome murder of Mrs Salome Abuh, during the 2019 governorship election. Recall that the state Police Command arrested six suspects in connection with the incident. The six suspects paraded were Ocholi Edicha, Adamu Haruna, Onu Egbunu, Musa Alidu, Attai Haruna and Attah Ejeh. The Kogi State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Busari had said Edicha aged 30 confessed that he led the gang that burnt the house of Elder Simon Abuh which led to the death of his wife, Mrs Salome Abuh. Following the development, Edicha was on Tuesday arraigned before Justice Ajayi who sentenced him to 12 years in prison. The prosecuting counsel, Barr. Otigbe Joseph, however, moved against the ruling, adding that it wasnâ€™t enough punishment for the offences committed which bothered on killing. Justice Ajayi while delivering Judgement, held that the oral testimony and eye witness account alongside statement made to the Nigeria Police was sufficient to secure the conviction of the defendant. He convicted the suspect for culpable homicide not punishable with death and sentenced him to 12 years and 6 months in prison for the offence.
