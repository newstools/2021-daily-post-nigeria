Doyin Okupe, a former aide to Ex-Presidents, Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan respectively, has given one major reason the North will not support Igbo presidency come 2023. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Okupe explained that the North are yet to forgive the Igbo over the incidences of 1966 of which one of the high points was the killing of Sardauna of Sokoto in what until today is believed by many people to be an Igbo coup. The former presidential aide, who has declared his interest to run in the 2023 presidency, pointed out that if the Igbos reach a consensus with the North, in the interest of equity, fairness and national unity, he will shelve his ambition. “A national consensus for Igbo Presidency cannot evolve until the core north forgives the Igbos for the killing of Sardauna of Sokoto by Nigerian soldiers of igbo extraction in the 1966 Coup. “If this consensus emerges, in the interest of equity, fairness & national unity, I will shelve my ambition & support whoever is chosen as a candidate by my party. “However, in the event that this national consensus is not achievable, I WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2023 by God’s Grace. “This is the political Knot only the Igbo leaders must spearhead and with the support of other well meaning Nigerians, resolve with a high level of humility and political dexterity,” he said.
