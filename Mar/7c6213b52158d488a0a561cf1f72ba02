Veteran Nigerian actor, Pete Edochie, has blamed feminism for the domestic violence women undergo in marriage. According to Edochie, women are at fault in most domestic violence incidents, adding that feminism causes them to be beaten up in marriages. The 74-year-old disclosed this while speaking to BBC Igbo. “Feminism is not something black people are known for. Once a woman leaves her parents to meet her husband and takes his surname, she is to be submissive to him. If she was not married, she could do whatever she wants,” Edochie said. “Women walk and show off their behinds. It is so that men would find them. If you see such a woman and express your marriage interest, then she starts walking properly. Our women now plunge into feminism nowadays. “They can not even keep their husbands any more. Is that a good thing? These women are schooled, but a lot of wives now can not even cook, one thing that a woman should be good at so as to be able to keep her husband. “My mother was not educated, but she would cook all sorts of soups, including bitter leaf, Oha, Ogbono, Okro, Egusi, Ukwa, and what have you. My father would always get back home hurriedly to eat what his wife had cooked. “Today, our wives cannot even cook any more. Women who cannot cook are not supposed to call themselves women. And feminism is what causes women to be beaten up in marriages. You complain to a woman, and she retorts. “It becomes unbearable, so you stretch your arm and deal her a slap. Domestic violence starts. I do not like seeing women crying because it hurts me deeply. But it’s the fault of the woman herself a lot of times.”
