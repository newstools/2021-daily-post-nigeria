Nigeria ended Benin Republic’s eight-year unbeaten run at home, when they completed the double over their West African rivals, in the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying series. Paul Onuachu’s late header clinched a 1-0 win in Porto Novo on Saturday. The Super Eagles had come from a goal down last year to beat the Squirrels 2-1. However, away from home, Gernot Rohr’s men found it tough, until the final moments of the game. The three-time African champions had already qualified for the tournament before kick-off, thanks to Lesotho’s goalless draw with Sierra Leone earlier in the day. With one round of fixtures left, Nigeria lead Group L with 11 points, four more than Benin. Sierra Leone have four points, while Lesotho are bottom with three. The Eagles host Lesotho in their final fixture on Tuesday.
