A group, Recover Nigeria Project has said that it would disrupt the conduct of the Anambra governorship election, scheduled for November 6, 2021. The group said it is unhappy that the Anambra State Government has failed to conduct local government election, thereby denying the people at the grassroots of quality representation. In a letter of notice sent to Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), signed by its leader, Comrade Osita Obi and made available to DAILY POST, the group said its members are determined to stake their lives to ensure that the governorship election did not hold, until that of local government was held. The letter entitled; Plan to disrupt the governorship election in Anambra State on November 6, read in part, “The reason for this action is because of the refusal by the state government to conduct local government election since inception. “We have repeatedly demanded that the local government election be conducted to deepen democracy and enthrone political justice. “We warn that the governorship election will not take place in Anambra State, until local government election have been conducted. We are ready to lay down our lives for this cause, democracy must be for.”
