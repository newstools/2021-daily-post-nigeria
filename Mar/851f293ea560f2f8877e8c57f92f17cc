Arsenal hero, Paul Merson, has claimed that Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, will run out of patience with Timo Werner at Stamford Bridge. Werner came from the bench as Chelsea played a 0-0 draw with Leeds United on Saturday. The Germany international was signed in a £47.5 million deal from RB Leipzig last summer but has struggled in his first season at Chelsea. The 25-year-old has scored just five Premier League goals for the West London club. Earlier this week, Tuchel was caught on the broadcast shouting at Werner over positioning during Chelsea’s win over Everton. Asked if he believes Tuchel is running out of patience with Werner, Merson told Sky Sports: “I think so, and I think even more so after the way Havertz played last week, I thought he was absolutely outstanding. “He came into the No.10 position, and I thought he was absolutely outstanding. “If you’d have said to me three months ago that Havertz is that quick, I’d have said I haven’t seen it. But I saw it last week. “It just shows you he’s a confident player, he looked very good. I think with the way he played, he will lose patience with Werner.”
