The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), on Monday, arraigned Odejobi Temitope Michael before Justice E. N. Alukwu of the State High Court in Enugu. Michael was charged for failing to return N2,000,000 wrongly sent to his account. The money was inadvertently paid in February 2019 by Chikezie Chukuma, who thought the account belonged to an auto dealer. It was when Chukuma went to take delivery of the car he realized the error in payment error. But the defendant failed to refund the money, forcing the owner to report the matter. Michael pleaded “not guilty” when the charge was read to him. His lawyer, B. J. Adigwe filed a motion for bail pending the determination of the case. The prosecution counsel, S. C. Anyanwu, opposed. Anyanwu argued that Michael might not return to face trial if he goes back to Benin Republic where he resides. Justice Alukwu ordered the remand of the defendant in EFCC custody and adjourned the case until April 25, 2021.
