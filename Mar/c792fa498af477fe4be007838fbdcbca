A medical doctor, Dr. Cyprian Ngong, who works with the National Hospital in Abuja, has become the first person to receive a jab of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. The vaccination exercise began on Friday, following the arrival of the vaccines earlier in the week. Ngong, whose vaccination was aired on national television, hailed the commencement of the exercise in Nigeria. He said, “We’ve been at the forefront of the COVID-19 fight here in the National Hospital at our isolation centre under the able leadership of the National Hospital. “They’ve provided everything we need for this fight. We’ve lost some, won some and we are happy we are getting the vaccine now in Nigeria. I think that is about the best news we’ve had since. “I only wished my dad had had that vaccine months ago. We lost him but we thank God. The fight is still on and we’ll win.” On how he feels after getting a jab, Ngong said, “You can see, I just took the vaccine now and I feel good. I dreamt of taking this vaccine and I have taken it today.”
