The All Progressives Congress APC has said youths in Nigeria are the greatest asset to the country. The ruling party said this while congratulating Afrobeat sensations, Burna Boy and Wizkid on their Grammy awards. APC in a statement by the National Secretary of its Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee CECPC, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe described both artistes as inspirations to the youths. Part of the statement read: “This is unarguably Nigeria’s biggest moment on the world’s music stage and an affirmation of our artistes and the vibrant afrobeat genre as an international musical force. “Burna Boy and Wizkid’s Grammy awards are an inspiration to Nigerian youths as they continue to make their mark in different endeavours. Our youths are our asset. Their creativity, talent, energy, innovation, and drive is positively impacting and changing the world today.” The party noted that the awards have crowned the efforts of the likes of Fela Ransome-Kuti who were the main progenitors of afrobeat/Afropop which has become mainstream music all over the world. “As a party, we are immensely proud that our musical stars are leading the pack of young Africans who are redefining the global music space,” the statement added. Burna Boy’s album ‘Twice as Tall’ won the Best Global Music Album category while Wizkid won the Best Music Video for his song ‘Brown Skin Girl’ with Beyoncé, Blue Ivy.
