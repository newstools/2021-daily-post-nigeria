Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo was not on the score sheet as Andrea Pirlo’s men thrashed Lazio 3-1 in the Serie A on Saturday night. The Portugal captain didn’t start the game against Lazio. He came from the bench in the 69th minute to replace Alvaro Morata. A goal from Andrien Rabiot and a brace from Morata gave Juventus all three points against Lazio at home. Joaquin Correa did score for the visitors against Juventus. The result against Lazio means Juventus are now in the third position on the Serie A table with 52 points from 25 games. However, reacting after the game, Ronaldo, in a post via his Instagram account, said: “great victory! Go on like this guys.” Ronaldo will now hope to start when Juventus host Porto on Tuesday in the Champions League last-16 second-leg tie. Juventus lost the first leg against the Portuguses side 2-1 last month.
