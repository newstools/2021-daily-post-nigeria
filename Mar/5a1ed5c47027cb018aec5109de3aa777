The Premier League has confirmed that referee Lee Mason will not take charge of any of this weekend’s games. Mason, 49, was at the centre of controversy last Saturday, during West Brom’s 1-0 victory over Brighton at the Hawthorns. He disallowed a Lewis Dunk free-kick, despite blowing his whistle for play to restart. It led to mass protests from the Brighton players and resulted in heavy criticism. Mason, who was due to be the fourth official for Liverpool’s game at Sheffield United 24 hours later, was then withdrawn, due to a ‘calf injury. That has again been cited as the reason for his lack of involvement this weekend.
