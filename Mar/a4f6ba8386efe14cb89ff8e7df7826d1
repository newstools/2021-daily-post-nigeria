Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has insisted that the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri Narrow gauge rail line is not good enough for Rivers State and the connecting states. Governor Wike said this while commissioning the Omuechi-Omokiri-Aluu Road in Ikwerre Local Government area of the state. He said the plan by the Federal government to complete the project in thirty-six months is unrealistic. According to Wike, “I heard some people came to Rivers State to flag-off narrow gauge when people are talking about standard gauge. And they are making noise about it. “Imagine Rivers State, the Treasure Base of the Nation. The state that they used the money to produce their president and towards the end of their administration they are telling us to have a narrow gauge. “I was watching Kakaaki and saw somebody saying he’s a minister and he said he does not drink. You want to finish the narrow gauge in 36 months. That is after they have left office.” Former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Austin Opara who commissioned the project said Governor Wike has been resourceful with State funds.
