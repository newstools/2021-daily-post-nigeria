Two men have been arrested by the police for allegedly gang-raping the 16-year-old daughter of their co-tenant at Owode-Egba area of Ogun State. The Suspects, Anthony John (35 years) and Jimoh Idowu (21 years), were arrested on Thursday, following a complaint lodged at Owode-Egba divisional headquarters by the victim. Ogun Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST on Monday that the victim had reported that she was at home with her younger siblings at Efunye village via Owode-Egba, when the two suspects, living in the same house with them, broke into their apartment at about 2am and dragged her into Anthony’s room. According to Oyeyemi, the teenager told the police that the two suspects knew that her parents had travelled and they seized the opportunity to forcefully break into their room, covering her mouth with a cloth and taking turns to have carnal knowledge of her. Upon the report, the DPO of Owode-Egba Division, CSP Ediae Mathew, was said to have quickly dispatched his men to the scene where the two suspects were apprehended. “On interrogation, the two suspects confessed to the commission of the crime without any sense of remorse,” Oyeyemi said.
