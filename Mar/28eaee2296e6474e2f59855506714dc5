The promoters of the mega party being planned ahead of the 2023 are reaching out to stakeholders. There are speculations that some of the proponents are members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The new platform, it was gathered, plans to register with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) before the end of 2021. The Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) says it has no plans to merge with any political party. The National Chairman, Falalu Bello, confirmed that the mega party planners had started inviting prospective allies. Bello told reporters in Abuja on Wednesday that the PRP had been contacted. “About 10 days ago, their secretary got across to me and advised me of the fact that we are invited to belong to the committee. I said let me have a formal invitation and what they stand for. “I will go to my National Executive Committee, brief them, get their mandate for me or any other person to represent the party.” Bello noted that though some parties had shown interest in the proposed mega platform, PRP would consider key factors before taking a decision. “Are these political parties being grouped on the basis of ideology? If it is on this, we will examine it and come to a conclusion. In the absence of that, we will decline to participate,” he said. Bello urged the federal government to rejig the entire security architecture of the nation. The chairman agreed with the opinion that Nigeria needs more police officers and urged the government to recruit massively.
