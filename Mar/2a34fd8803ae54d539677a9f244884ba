As a way of tackling the security and socio-economic challenges occasioned by the migration of some herders from Oyo to Kwara state, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State hosted his Kwara State counterpart Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazak to a security meeting on Tuesday, March 2. The meeting involved some traditional rulers, heads of security and top government functionaries from Kwara and Oyo states. Kwara State also shares border with Oyo and Ondo States.

Meanwhile, in the past two months, Osun State has witnessed series of kidnapping, cult activities and more. The latest kidnapping in Osun State, Saturday evening, in which passengers plying Ibadan/Akure expressway by Egbu Village Ikire, were violently abducted by criminals at Wasinmi, has continued to generate reactions amongst residents. The Police claimed those abducted had been rescued, adding that security operatives were on the trail of the kidnappers. Meanwhile, in early February, six passengers and the driver of a Toyota Sienna bus were abducted along the Ilesa-Akure expressway. The abductors released three of them and sent them to inform the public about their abduction before the rest were later released after huge amounts were allegedly paid as ransom. Also early this year, three Chinese expatriates were abducted at the mining site around Ilesa, in the Osun East senatorial district. They regained their freedom a week later after ransom in foreign currency allegedly exchanged hands.
