Super Eagles handler, Gernot Rohr has sympathized with Benin Republic over their 1-0 loss to Nigeria in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Saturday. Benin thought they had made it to Cameroon 2022 with few seconds to the referee’s final whistle but were shocked by Paul Onuachu’s header. With the win, Gernot Rohr’s men also ended the Squirrels’ 8-year unbeaten record at home. “It’s easier to play if you are already qualified so the players wanted to go ahead,” Rohr explained during his post-match press conference. “The challenge was to win here since 2013, Benin has not lost a match at home and the players absolutely wanted to do so and to be the first in eight years to beat them. “It hurts my heart to see an opponent lose at the last second but it’s true there is no place for emotions, really in football”.
