A housewife, Fatima Salisu, on Wednesday, approached a Grade 1 Area Court, Kubwa for the dissolution of her 12-year-old marriage to Abubakar, over alleged abandonment by her husband. She told the court that she married Abubakar under Islamic law in 2009 and he left their matrimonial home in Dei-dei, Abuja in Febuary, 2020, without any reason. ”We do not have children. ”My husband now live in Mararaba, Nasarawa State and efforts to reach him for my welfare and needs have proved abortive. ” I don’t love him any more and I am no longer interested in the marriage due to his abandonment. I pray to the court to dissolve the marriage,” she said. Abubakar, however, was not in court. The judge, Muhammad Adamu said Abubakar was served with court processes by the court clerk, Dangana Bawa. Adamu adjourned the matter until March 15 for hearing in the interest of justice. He ordered Bawa to serve Abubakar processes, informing him of the new date, NAN reports.
