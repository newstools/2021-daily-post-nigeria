Doyin Okupe, a former aide to ex-Presidents, Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan, has given an insight into the possible cause of Bola Tinubu’s near fall on Saturday in Kaduna. The national leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC had slipped on Saturday during the 2021 Annual Arewa House Lecture. The former Lagos Governor was walking by the high table, exchanging pleasantries with dignitaries when he staggered. The politician’s security details quickly pulled him up by the traditional agbada attire which he had on while he continued to shake hands and exchange pleasantries with his colleagues. Following the incident? Some Nigerians raised concerns about the health of the one-time lawmaker, who is believed to be interested in succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Doyin Okupe, in a series of tweets on Sunday, claimed that there was no “slump” nor “stumbling” as many other media platforms may have reported. “I think I should begin by commenting on Bola Tinubu’s purported “slump” or “stumbling” at the Arewa Lecture. Please let it be clear that I am not commenting on the state of health of Asiwaju,” he tweeted. He said “What I saw was a Bola Tinubu walking on a plain and unaware of a step down in level or a slight descent which created a misstep and a stumble leading to a brief staggering which can happen to anyone walking in a crowded unfamiliar terrain “Just on my own observation drawn from watching the video currently in circulation. There was neither a fall nor a slump. From that video. These English words cannot be ascribed to what is seen in the video.”
