Former Real Madrid striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Manchester United to beat Leicester City when both teams clash in the FA Cup tie at the King Power Stadium on Sunday. Owen also predicted Chelsea to defeat Sheffield United at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Providing his predictions, Owen told BetVictor: “Manchester United have been imperious away from home this season, and their amazing streak continued when they defeated Manchester City at the Etihad a couple of weeks ago. “They repeated the trick midweek at the San Siro, so there’s no doubt confidence will be high in the Red Devils camp. “Leicester are a good side. However, other than last week’s 5-0 win against doomed Sheffield United, they have been too in and out for me lately. “With that in mind, I think Manchester United will walk away from the King Power with all three points. Leicester City 0, Manchester United 1.” On the Chelsea vs Sheffield United game, Owen said, “Through to the UEFA Champions League semi-finals, it’s turning into an unbelievable opening spell for Thomas Tuchel at Chelsea. On paper, the Blues have been handed a favourable FA Cup tie here, so they must be optimistic of making progress. “For Sheffield United, their dreams of Premier League survival faded long ago, and now in cup competition mode, I think it might be hard for them to raise their game. With that in mind, I’m siding with Tuchel’s men to progress. Chelsea 2, Sheffield United 0.” The kick-off time for Leicester vs Man United is 6 pm, while that of Chelsea vs Sheffield is 2:30 pm.
