Juventus sporting director, Fabio Paratici, has insisted they have no plans to allow Cristiano Ronaldo leave. Despite scoring 23 goals in 24 Serie A games, Ronaldo has become the target of criticism for a dismal season. It continued on Sunday, with a shock 1-0 home defeat to relegation battlers Benevento, who had not won in 11 matches. Ronaldo was meant to help Juve win the Champions League for the first time since 1996. That has not happened, with the Italian champions crashing out in the last 16 after losing to FC Porto. But Paratici remained firm on Ronaldo’s importance to the club “This is Juve, we have Cristiano Ronaldo, the best player in the world, and we’re holding on tight,” he said.
