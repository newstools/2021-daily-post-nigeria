Paris Saint-Germain boss, Mauricio Pochettino, has vowed that his team “will fight to the death” to win the UEFA Champions League trophy this season. Pochettino’s side will seek to book their place in the Champions League last-8 when they host Barcelona in the round of 16 second-leg tie on Wednesday. PSG defeated Barcelona 4-1 in the first-leg encounter at Camp Nou last month. Speaking during a pre-match interview with LFP, Pochettino said: “Clearly, it is the ambition of the club that we win it. “There are a lot of other teams who want to win it [Champions League]. It’s not that easy. “We’re aware of our responsibility, and we will fight to the death to achieve it.” PSG head to the game against Barcelona after beating Brest 3-0 in the French Cup on Saturday.
