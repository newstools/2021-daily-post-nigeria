Arsenal have boosted their chances of fighting for a place in next season’s Champions League, thanks to a 2-0 win over Manchester United in the Women’s Super League. Quickfire goals from Jill Roord and Lotte Wubben-Moy in either half sealed the win. Arsenal had to defend with 10 players for 20 minutes after Beth Mead received a second booking. The victory means Arsenal cut the gap between them and third-placed United to three points, having played a game less. Now they just need to maintain their record against teams outside the top four, where they have not suffered a defeat since 2018. A third Women’s Super League side will compete in next season’s Champions League for the first time, with the competition being expanded.
