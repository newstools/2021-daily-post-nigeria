Salihu Tanko Yakasai, a former Special Adviser on Media to Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has said that President Muhammadu Buhari is confusing bandits with conflicting ultimatums. Yakasai was fired last month for criticising Buhari and his All Progressives Congress (APC) government, over the President’s inability to secure the country. Last Friday, unknown gunmen stormed the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation in Kaduna State. Security forces were said to have rescued 180 of the abductees, but 39 students are still in the den of the kidnappers. On Saturday, Buhari’s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said the president “issued a stern warning to would-be terrorists and bandits targeting schools, saying the country will not allow the destruction of the school system”. Reacting to the tweet by the Presidential spokesman, Yakasai wrote, “To be honest, you’re confusing these bandits/terrorists. Last week in Zamfara, you gave them two months’ notice, today na stern warning, which one should they take seriously Mallam Garba? If I’m a father with a kid in boarding school in the affected states, I’ll withdraw them kawai.” Yakasai was also detained last month by the Department of State Services (DSS) over his criticisms of Buhari.
