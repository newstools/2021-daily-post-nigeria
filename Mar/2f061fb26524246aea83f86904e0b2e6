Yobe State Commissioner for Basic and Secondary Education, Dr. Mohammed Sani Idriss has said the decision by the government to shut down all public boarding secondary schools across the 17 local government areas of the state is to safeguard the lives of students and that of their teachers. In a brief parley with newsmen on Monday in Damaturu, the commissioner noted that the decision became imperative following a security advice considering what is happening in some Northwestern states. Idriss said, “the directive will not affect SS 3 students”. It was gathered that, security has been beefed up around schools across the state to avert the reoccurrence of Dapchi school abduction. Recall that Niger, Zamfara and Kano states have recently shut down secondary schools in their states over fear of attacks by armed bandits.
