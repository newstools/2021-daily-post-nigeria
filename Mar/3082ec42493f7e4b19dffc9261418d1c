The Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, has insisted that no serious-minded politician will overlook the opportunity of becoming the President of Nigeria. Fayemi disclosed this during an interview on Hard Copy, a Channels Television programme, on Friday. According to the governor, “I am laughing. You know why? I get asked this question all the time. I do not know any serious-minded politician who will have the opportunity to govern a country with the blessings that we have – in spite of the challenges – that will not give it a shot, but we are not there yet. “I’m considering finishing well in Ekiti in 2022. I’ve a job. Frankly, I am eternally grateful to the Ekiti people for giving me the opportunity to govern the state twice, and I still have a lot to deliver on that agenda. “So, the future will take care of itself. I’ve no means of knowing what is going to happen, but for me, the certainty is that I’m the Governor of Ekiti State, and that term expires in October 2022. That is the job I’ve for now.” Recall that Fayemi, who is also the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, was recently endorsed for the Presidency by the Ekiti State House of Assembly.
