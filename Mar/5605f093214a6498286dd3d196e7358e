Nigerian music legend, Tuface Idibia has given his two-cents on the issue of religious practice in Nigeria. Tuface in a series of posts on his Instagram story said religion is meant to be a moral gym, adding that anything aside from that is a scam. According to him, anyone who claims to be fighting for God on your behalf is downgrading and insulting God because God gave humans everything including brains. His post read: “For me, religion is supposed to be moral gym anything else is a scam. Allow me to elaborate before you exhibit any religious arrogance “First off God is too much so any human that claims they are fighting for God is downgrading and insulting God. My God packed everything already. E come add brain join “Respect to every religion but you can’t tell me nothing. Na moral gym e suppose be. My God no need nobody help, he too much. “Feel free to arrange yourself go your heaven I go find my way come there. Bless us. The reason wey God give us brain na to use am. Miss me with any religious arrogance.”
