The European Union (EU) has reported Nigeria to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The complaint concerns Nigeria’s policy on dairy. WTO Director-General, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, disclosed this in Abuja on Tuesday, during her visit to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Okonjo-Iweala confirmed that WTO has received a letter from the EU complaining about Nigeria’s restrictions on milk and dairy products. She said they will look into the complaint, but urged the Nigerian government to take advantage of the trade remedy initiative in place, to protect local industries. In reaction, CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, explained that the process to bring milk and dairy producers has been on for six years, with the milk and dairy producers treating the matter with levity. One of the producers, he said, has been in Nigeria for over 60 years and has not deemed it necessary to engage in backward integration but is rather comfortable importing products.
