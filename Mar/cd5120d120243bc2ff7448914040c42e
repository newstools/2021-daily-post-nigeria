The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has said President Muhammadu Buhari’s routine medical trips overseas is an indictment of his Presidency’s failure to fix Nigeria’s healthcare system. The party stressed that the current administration has wrecked the country’s healthcare sector. Buhari, who had departed Nigeria for the United Kingdom, UK, would meet with his doctors for a medical check up. Reacting to the trip, the former ruling party in a series of tweets, charged Buhari to fix the country’s healthcare system. According to PDP: “It is indeed worrisome that under President @MBuhari, even the hitherto highly rated State House Clinic, has become so moribund that it cannot provide a simple medical check-up service for Mr. President. “While the @OfficialPDPNig has nothing against where any person, including President @MBuhari, seeks his or her medical services, our party is worried that the @MBuhari Presidency is taking no decisive steps to fix our healthcare system, ostensibly because Mr. President can afford overseas medical treatment at taxpayers’ expense. “The @OfficialPDPNig is disturbed that while Mr. President jets out for medical treatment in well-equipped hospitals abroad, our hospitals and medical personnel are in very sorry situations while millions of our compatriots suffer, with many dying on a daily basis from conditions that have simple medical solutions. “Our party urges President @MBuhari to show leadership by reflecting on the fact that millions of Nigerians cannot afford overseas treatment and have become despondent by his failure to take decisive steps to address our national healthcare needs.”
