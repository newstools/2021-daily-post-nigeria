Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has warned that Fulani herdsmen have no land for permanent settlement in the whole of Southern Nigeria, particularly the South East. Kanu warned that any South-East or South-South governor, traditional ruler, or President General of any community that cedes any space, including for financial reason to Fulani herdsmen, is ultimately calling for the death of their people. Speaking through the spokesman of IPOB, Emma Powerful, the separatist group declared its security outfit, Eastern Security Network, ESN, would not spare such a person as they will equally pay with their own lives. A statement by Powerful reads: “IPOB has made it abundantly clear that we have no land for Fulani herdsmen settlement in Biafra land, the North have more space than the South, especially the South East. “We must warn that any traditional ruler or President General of every any community in Biafraland who ventures to cede any space of land to the Fulani herdsmen for the sake of monetary gain, or issue, is ultimately calling for the death of their people. “The person must equally pay with his own life for such ceding of land to the Fulani herdsmen, he must die, IPOB and ESN are prepared to deal with them. Even the governor who tried will not go scot-free. “We don’t have land for Fulani terrorists in Nigeria they are free to stay in the North where they were allowed in 1804.”
