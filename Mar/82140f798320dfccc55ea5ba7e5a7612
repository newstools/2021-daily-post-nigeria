Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams has raised the alarm over the killing of four men by those believed to be Iskilu Wakili’s men. Adams said the locals were hacked to death at Idiyan village, Igangan, Oyo State, on Monday, one day after Wakili was arrested by the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC). The Yoruba leader, in a statement by his spokesman, Kehinde Aderemi, said the perpetrators have been terrorising the village and its environs. Adams said they have collected over N800 million as ransom from scores of captives. The Aare lamented that Wakili and his men already displaced about one million residents in more than 10 villages in Oke Ogun. “They have raped, killed residents at will. Alhaja Sherifat, Dr. Fatai Aborode and several others were killed. They are still on a rampage till today. They have been terrorising our people for more than six years. “Today, four men were hacked to death at Idiyan village. It is sad and most unfortunate, that the police have not been able to unravel the killers till the present time.” He warned criminal herders to stay away from the South-West, insisting that the OPC and other local security operatives will continue to ensure that the region is safe.
