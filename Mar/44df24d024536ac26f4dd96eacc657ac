The Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP), at the weekend, attacked Nigerian troops and vigilantes fighting with them. The soldiers and Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) members were heading to Kukawa town from Kauwa settlement in Borno State. The insurgents ambushed the contingent who were on a raid operation. The government forces scampered to take cover and returned fire. DAILY POST gathered that all sides recorded casualties. At least one soldier and one CJTF personnel were killed; ISWAP suffered more losses. The fallen civilian fighter was identified as Yusuf Idris. A search operation is underway to find three of his colleagues declared missing after the battle. Troops wounded are receiving treatment. Following the killing of many commanders and guerillas since the start of the year, ISWAP has stepped up buried landmines and ambuscades to increase casualties among troops.
