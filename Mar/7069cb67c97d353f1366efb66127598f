Senator Uche Ekwunife formally joined the Anambra State governorship race on Tuesday. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain submitted her nomination form at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja. Ekwunife said it was too late for the PDP to choose a consensus candidate. “I am running to win, I don’t see how consensus arrangement will work,” she declared. The lawmaker expressed her conviction of beating other aspirants. Ekwunife promised to remain in the party if she doesn’t win the ticket for the November 6 election. She pledged to reform the security architecture of the state and to continue to empower women if elected. Ekwunife, a former House of Representatives member, is among the strong female politicians in Nigeria.
