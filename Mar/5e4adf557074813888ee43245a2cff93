A number of persons were reportedly injured on Monday afternoon when the car they were travelling in collided with an articulated vehicle at the LAMECO Roundabout, Service Area in Osogbo. According to reports, the cause of the accident could not be ascertained but the articulated vehicle conveying a bulldozer crushed the car beyond recognition. As at the time DAILY POST got to the scene of the accident, the passengers in the car who sustained various degrees of injuries had been rushed to a hospital within Osogbo. Eyewitnesses said the accident was caused by the carelessness of both drivers as none of them wanted to give the right of way to the other. They called on the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), to commence surveillance on that particular section of the Ring Road in Osogbo as it was prone to accidents. This accident occurred despite efforts by the FRSC to clamp down on rickety and worn-out vehicles.
