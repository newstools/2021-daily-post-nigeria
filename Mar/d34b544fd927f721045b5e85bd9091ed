Super Eagles manager, Gernot Rohr, has said he will invite 23 players including Ahmed Musa for their final two 2021 AFCON qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho. Rohr specifically name-checked Musa, who is still clubless, having failed to agree a deal with Premier League side, West Brom. “All is going well. The list is done; NFF will release the list soon,” the German told NationSport. When pressed on the probable players in the squad, Rohr added: “We have a list of 23 plus captain Musa; six players on standby,” Nigeria need only a point to qualify for the 2021 AFCON to be played in Cameroon next year. The Super Eagles face Benin on March 27 in Porto Novo and three days later they host Lesotho in Lagos in the final qualifiers.
