The Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, has sanctioned the Divisional Police Officer of Ajao Estate Division. Other senior officers in the Division have been redeployed to undisclosed offices. They were penalized for allowing night clubbing at Garbana Club on Sunday. They had arrested 41 clubbers there between 1.40 am and 2.30 am. Odumosu announced the sanction on Monday while addressing Area Commanders and DPOs at the POWA Hall, Ikeja. The CP warned Area Commander and DPOs to enforce COVID-19 protocols in their areas. Odumosu urged residents to wear face masks in public and reiterated the ban of night clubbing. He added that surprise visits to areas across Lagos will continue. More than 110 clubbers were arrested at the weekend by operatives of the Lagos Taskforce led by the Commander, CSP Sola Jejeloye. The violators were nabbed at Garbana Club in Ajao Estate and DNA Club in Victoria Island.
