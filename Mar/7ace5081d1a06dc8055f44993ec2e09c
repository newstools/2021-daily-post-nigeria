The Northern Elders Forum, NEF, has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of being too slow in tackling insecurity in the country. Spokesman of the NEF, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, lamented that Nigeria is currently falling apart due to insecurity challenges. He pointed out that banditry and kidnapping, that did not exist two, three years ago, has now become a menace. Appearing on Arise Television, the NEF spokesman averred that Nigerians are becoming more insecure daily. Baba-Ahmed stressed that the spate of insecurity in the country was responsible for the ongoing secession moves. He said: “If I have an opportunity to speak with the president, I will say: ‘Sir, please wake up and smell the coffee, this country is falling apart. “It is in very serious danger, it is going down under your watch. You swore in 2015 and again in 2019 that you will protect the citizens and Nigeria’s territorial integrity. Sorry, sir, you are not doing that, doing it well, or you are not doing it at all. “Why are we being so insecure? Why is it not possible for Nigerians to deal with banditry, kidnappings? These things two, three years ago, did not exist. Is anybody asking these questions? “You are too slow, and people are smelling a vacuum around your government and this is why you see people saying we don’t want to be part of Nigeria.” Nigerians are currently battling with the issue of Kidnapping and banditry. Several students and residents in some parts of the North have been abducted and later released in some Northern states. Amid these insecurity challenges, the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore had blamed state governors for banditry in the North. The group had claimed that pressures from governors turned some herdsmen into bandits. It stated that the pressure had made some herders to lose their cattle and businesses, hence resorting to banditry.
