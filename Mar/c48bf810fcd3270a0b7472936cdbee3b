A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Prof Kingsley Moghalu, on Monday, said the former Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo, remains the country’s best president since the beginning of civilian government in 1999. In a statement on Monday, the former presidential candidate said Obasanjo was successful because “he was focused on Nigeria as his constituency, not his ethnic group.” He stressed that the former president was leading like a “president of Nigeria, not a provincial politician”. Moghalu said, “OBJ, faults and all, is our best President since 1999. One key reason for his success is that he was focused on Nigeria as his constituency not his ethnic group. All his career was federal/international – nation-building, national security, economy, foreign affairs. Professor Kingsley said Nigeria remains a unique country with a unit of purpose and destiny. Olusegun Obasanjo was Nigerian President from 1999 to 2007 when he was succeeded by late Yar’adua.
