Controversial Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, on Wednesday suggested ways the Federal Government can resolve the challenge of banditry in the North. Gumi said the Federal Government should adopt the non-kinetic approach in tackling banditry and insecurity in the Northern part of the country. In an exclusive interview with DAILY POST, the cleric explained that the use of kinetic force was responsible for the current insecurity issue in the North. He stressed that bandits feel, “everybody is against them,” hence they are vicious and aggressively fighting for survival. According to Gumi: “Honestly speaking, there has to be a synergy of armed forces acting towards tackling insecurity. They should adopt the non-kinetic approach which should be about 80 percent because these people are ordinary Nigerians. “Government should meet and dialogue with them because they are ready to listen. If the Government can apply the non-kinetic approach, it would have taken care of about 90 percent of the problem. So the 10 percent is where the kinetic comes into play. “The use of kinetic force is what led to what we are having now. They think it’s an ethnic cleansing where everybody is against them, and they are fighting for survival, very vicious and aggressive.” States like Niger, Zamfara, Kebbi, Katsina and Kaduna have witnessed the sting of banditry lately. Several students and residents have been abducted and a few killed during their operations in these states. Despite their abduction, the students have been released.
