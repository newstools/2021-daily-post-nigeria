The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to commence investigation into the allegation of missing arms funds made by the National Security Adviser, (NSA), General Babagana Monguno (rtd), against the past Service Chiefs. Monguno in an interview with the BBC Hausa had said that “neither the money approved by Buhari for arms was met on ground when the new service chiefs assumed office.” Things took a different turn after his interview generated a lot of backlash from Nigerians on social media. Following the development, the office of the NSA in a statement released said Monguno was quoted out of context as he did not say that funds meant for arms procurement were missing under the ex-service chiefs as reported or transcribed by some media outlets. Reacting, SERAP in a statement by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, said the NSA’s denial should not be the end of the issue. Oluwadare also urged President Buhari to order anti-graft agencies to probe the missing arms funds. “Any allegations of corruption in the spending of public fund must be promptly, thoroughly, and transparently investigated. “Suspected perpetrators should equally be brought to book if there is relevant admissible evidence. “Also, any missing public funds must be fully recovered and returned to the treasury. “Finally, investigating and prosecuting the allegations would help Nigerians know if the funds meant to defend the country and for purchase of arms to empower Nigerian soldiers have been transparently and accountably spent,” the statement said.
