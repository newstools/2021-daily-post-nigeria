A Customary Court in Mapo, Ibadan, Oyo State has dissolved a six-year-old marriage between a trader, Kaosara Okeowo and her husband, Lateef, over alleged threat to life. The mother of two had told the court that she was in danger because her husband wants to use her for ritual. Delivering judgment, Chief Ademola Odunade, the President of the court, dissolved the marriage in the interest of peace. NAN reports that Odunade awarded custody of the two children to Okeowo. The arbitrator ordered Lateef to pay N10,000 as child support. Testifying, Okeowo said, “My Lord, things are not going on well. He requests for unusual and personal things from me.” But Lateef denied the allegations. ”She can go if she wants to leave. I want the court to order her to return his cooking utensils, clothes and a big ram in her custody,” he said. However, Lateef’s father argued that his son was not a ritualist and that his daughter-in-law was such an opportunist who had seen another man with more money.
