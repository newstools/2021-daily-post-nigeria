Police in Jigawa State has arrested a 40-year-old man Ayuba Ibrahim over the alleged killing of his son. The child of about one year identified as Yusuf Ayuba was reportedly born out of wedlock. Police public relations officer Asp Zubairu Aminudeen Ismail confirmed the incident to DAILY POST. He said the suspect deceitfully collected the deceased from his mother under the pretence that he was taking him to his sister. The suspect later called and informed the mother that the baby died on his way to kano and has been buried. Zubairu explained that investigations revealed that the said child was born out of wedlock and that the father collected the child from the mother three weeks ago, killed and kept him in a bag and hid the dead body in a gutter along Maigatari road. He said the police had located and removed the childâ€™s corpse from where it was hidden by the father. The body was taken for medical examination and later released to the relatives for proper burial. The police public relations officer, however, said the case is still under investigation.
