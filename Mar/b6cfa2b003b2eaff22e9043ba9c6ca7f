Former Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, says he has no rift with Governor Douye Diri. Dickson said his absence from government functions was deliberate and in consonance with his principles of non-interference. In a statement on Thursday, the Senator representing Bayelsa West, said he was supportive of Diri’s administration. Dickson denied fuelling media attacks against the state government by some of his former aides. John Idumange, former General Manager of Bayelsa Broadcasting Corporation, alleged diversion of N3billion agricultural loan obtained by Dickson’s administration from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Idumange, ex-aide on Research and Documentation to Dickson, claimed the present administration was diminishing the efforts of Dickson’s government. He vowed to report the alleged fraud to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Responding, Dickson said no one supportive of him or a PDP member should publicly criticise the government. “I am aware that some of our party stalwarts and members that I led in these unprecedented battles and victories, have one complain of non-inclusion or the other which is normal. “The governor and the party are available to address these issues and as such, do not call for a public attack on our government because an attack on the governor and his government is an attack on our party and I do not approve of such. ”My role and my duty as former governor and the first governor to have done eight years, who midwifed the process of reelection, is to advise, support and pray for the success of this administration”, the lawmaker noted.
