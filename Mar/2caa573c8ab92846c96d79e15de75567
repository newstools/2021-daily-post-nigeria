Former Manchester City defender, Micah Richards, has named reigning champions, Bayern Munich, as the club that will win this season’s Champions League. Richards believes Bayern Munich are favourites to win the Europe top-flight tournament, followed by Man City and then Paris Saint-Germain. Bayern Munich already have one foot in the last-8 after they thrashed Lazio 4-1 in the round of 16 first leg last month. Man City and PSG both won their first leg fixtures against Borussia Monchengladbach and Barcelona, respectively, putting themselves in pole positions to progress to the last-8. “My top three would be PSG third, Man City second at this moment in time and then Bayern,” Richards told CBS Sports’ ‘¡Qué Golazo Podcast! ‘. “But I don’t want to get too excited because we have seen what happened in the Champions League with Lyon. “Everyone was expecting us to win that, and it did not happen. They are still in all four competitions this season, and as soon as you take your eye off the ball as soon as your start looking at games down the road, you forget the challenge that is in front of you. “I believe they have evolved from last season, and they have got more confidence. Will they win it? I am not sure. Have they got a better chance? Definitely.”
