Manchester City midfielder, Phil Foden has said that he feels sorry for England senior national team coach, Gareth Southgate over the selection headache he may be facing. The 20-year-old who had his fourth cap for England after coming in as a substitute against San Marino on Thursday, is one of the numerous talents at Southgate’s disposal. Foden is also hoping to be a part of England squad for this summer’s European Championship having in mind that many injured players will return to the team. Foden who is enjoying a fine run of form with Manchester City, can, however, add to his international caps in England’s upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Poland. The youngster concedes that there is competition for places in Southgate’s squad and he does not envy the choices facing the Three Lions coach. “It’s hard to get a place [in this team],” said Foden, according to Goal. “There are so many great talents in the attacking third, so I do feel sorry for him [Southgate] a bit having to pick 11. “It’s very difficult and all I can do is keep fighting for my place. That’s all I can do really. “It’s really important to be consistent with your club. I want to just take that form into England. If I don’t get picked I will just keep working hard and try and improve.”
