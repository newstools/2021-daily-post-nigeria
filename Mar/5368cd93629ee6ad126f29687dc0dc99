Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has warned purveyors of Nigeria’s break up to desist. The VP spoke at the palace of the Emir of Gombe, Abubakar Shehu, during a courtesy visit on Tuesday. Osinbajo declared that those fanning embers of disunity among Nigerians would be put to shame. “Nigeria is one and we believe in unity; therefore those causing problems should stop because they will not succeed,” NAN quoted him as saying. In his remarks, Shuhe said Osinbajo’s presence was an honour to the emirate and the state. The monarch thanked the Federal Government for resuscitating Wawa-Zange Grazing reserve. Governor Inuwa Yahaya reiterated his administration’s readiness to support the federal government’s projects in the state. Osinbajo is in Gombe to attend the 27th edition of National Micro Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) Clinic. The VP will flag off the distribution of CAC free Business Registration certificates, among others.
