Bachiri Sarkin-Fulani, Zamfara Coordinator of Child Protection Network (CPN) says bandits must be punished. He advised Zamfara Governor, Bello Matawalle to review his peace initiative with bandits. In a statement on Monday, Sarkin-Fulani condemned last Friday’s abduction of female students from Government Secondary School, Jangebe. “The culprits must unconditionally release their captives who should be safely reunited with their parents. They must also be appropriately punished to serve as deterrent to others. “The ugly trend of the terrorist must be stopped in order to save lives, properties as well as our educational sector.” He urged the state government to reopen all schools, noting that the current closure means criminals had an upper hand. Sarkin-Fulani suggested that the schools should be opened on daily basis, so that the students can be sleeping at home. The NGO coordinator hailed Matawalle’s efforts to secure the release of the abductees.
