Christians in Kwara State, on Wednesday rejected the government’s decision to reopen schools which were previously shut down over hijab crisis. Recall that the state government on Tuesday night ordered the reopening of the affected schools, stating that its decision to permit willing Muslim schoolgirls to wear their hijab in public schools “will lead to sustainable peace and communal harmony anchored on mutual respect and understanding.” The governor, in a statement which was issued by the state Ministry of Education, cited other states with similar cases where willing students are allowed to use their hijabs. However, some students and teachers who resumed for classes on Wednesday following the governor’s order, were reportedly denied entrance into the school premises. It was also gathered that some Christian teachers and management staff were seen displaying placards in protest to express their displeasure over the government’s decision. About ten schools owned by different Church denominations had rejected the use of hijab in their various schools.
