Former Kaduna lawmaker, Shehu Sani, has cautioned governors seeking to run for presidency in 2023 after President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure. Sani in a post on Friday warned interested governors to seek opinions of family members and predecessors before going into the race. His tweet read: “If you are a Governor in your second tenure, and some people are pushing you to contest for the presidency of this complicated country, seek the candid advice of your family who would bear the burden and consult your predecessors who were pushed by the same people.“ Recently, banners and campaign posters of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State as a presidential aspirant for the 2023 election surfaced in Adamawa State. The posters were seen on Thursday in some parts of Yola, the state capital. One of the posters reads, ‘For a Generational Change 2023; Yahaya Bello for President’ However, It is not certain if the governor would run for the said position in 2023. Bello had said that only God would decide if he would contest in 2023 or not.
