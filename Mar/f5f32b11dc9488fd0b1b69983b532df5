Former Liverpool player, Mark Lawrenson, has warned Rangers manager, Steven Gerrard, to be ‘be very, very careful’ on his next move amid reports linking him with a return to Liverpool to replace head coach, Jurgen Klopp. Klopp is under intense pressure at Liverpool following the club’s 1-0 defeat against Fulham at Anfield on Sunday. The result against Fulham was Liverpool’s sixth consecutive home loss this term. However, Lawrenson feels Liverpool appointing Gerrard, who guided Rangers to win the Scottish Premiership title on Sunday, would be a ‘big gamble’. “What I would say is that, for all the success at Rangers, managing Liverpool is on a different spectrum,” Lawrenson told the BBC. “It would be a big gamble for the club’s owners, Fenway Sports Group, to appoint him [Steven Gerrard]. I think the one-eyed Liverpool fan would be saying “Get Stevie G in” if Jurgen Klopp were to leave, but I think others would take a step back and go: ‘he’s done an absolutely fabulous job at Rangers, he was a great player, but maybe he would need to take another job in the Premier League first.’ “I also do not see Klopp going anywhere. He won’t be losing his job anytime soon. “The trouble for Steven then is that other managers who have moved on from their first job as a stepping stone to something bigger end up not having the same success, so he has to be very, very careful. “He will already be thinking about winning the [Scottish] Premiership again next season, and the chance for a shot in the [UEFA] Champions League with Rangers. “But, in the unlikely event that Liverpool come calling this summer, Steven couldn’t say no. Because you won’t get asked twice.”
