A member of the Nigerian Senate, Enyinnanya Abaribe, has described President Muhammadu Buhari’s trip to the UK for medical check-up as morally wrong. Abaribe, speaking on Channels TV on Wednesday, recalled how Buhari criticised medical tourism and assured he would never travel abroad for medical check-up. The lawmaker representing Abia South senatorial zone said Buhari’s medical trip shows an All Progressives Congress, APC, government which says one thing but does otherwise. He wondered why the president cannot have a medical check-up at the state house clinic, adding that COVID-19 was meant to enable the government to upgrade medical facilities in the country. His comment comes at a time when President Muhammadu Buhari has flown to the UK for medical check-up. Abaribe said, “Buhari has not done anything wrong in the eyes of the law, he has the right to take care of himself medically but morally he has done everything wrong this was the president that told us that he would never go for check up or trip abroad and condemned the huge amount of money spent on medical tourism before he was elected in 2015. “But shortly after he lived more abroad than in Nigeria. When COVID -19 pandemic started we were assured that medical facilities in Nigeria will be upgraded and there will be no need of our money spent abroad but we are surprised nothing has changed and he still depends on going abroad for medicals “One would have expected that the state house clinic would have minimum to do a check-up for him but what can we do we have seen an APC government that says one thing and does another.”
