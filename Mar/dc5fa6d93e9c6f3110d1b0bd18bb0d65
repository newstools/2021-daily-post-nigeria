The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned Saturday’s attack and assassination attempts on Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State by suspected killer herdsmen. This was contained in a statement on Saturday evening, signed by Kola Ologbondiyan, the party’s national publicity secretary. Ologbondiyan called on President Muhammadu Buhari to put machinery in motion to manhunt, arrest and prosecute the assailants. “The PDP expresses shock that the assailants trailed Governor Ortom and opened fire on him and his aides along Makurdi/Gboko road, in an attack that by every indication is aimed to assassinate the governor. The PDP expressed fear for the life of the governor and said it was worrisome that the attempt is coming on the heels of Ortoms recent outspokenness against open grazing. “Our party is worried that this brazen attempt at Governor Ortom’s life is coming on the heels of his outspokenness in exposing those allegedly behind the incessant attacks of communities in the state and demanding that the Federal Government lives up to its responsibility on the protection of life and property in the state.” “The PDP fears for the life of Governor Ortom and we urge Nigerians to hold the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration responsible for its failure to take a decisive step to check the escalated insecurity and brazen attacks on innocent Nigerians. “The PDP, however, calls on Governor Ortom not to be deterred by the attack but to remain courageous and at alert, at all times while providing leadership to the people of his state. “The party also calls on the people of Benue State to be calm and vigilant while providing useful information to security agencies to flush bandits and criminal elements out of the state and other parts of the country.” The statement said
