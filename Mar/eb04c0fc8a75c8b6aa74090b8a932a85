Legendary Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has said Tottenham Hotspur can be in a position to offer Harry Kane the ambition he needs and advised him to stay with the North London side. Kane on Sunday, took his international tally to 33 goals in 52 matches for England when he netted against Albania. It has led to several football figures calling for the 27-year-old to leave Spurs to fulfil his career ambitions. But Wenger believes Spurs can still give Kane the platform he needs to achieve his goals. Wenger told beIN Sports: “Tottenham are in a position where they can be ambitious and we should maybe not judge only today’s situation. “Tottenham was top of the league in December. There were a few times when they were top of the league when I was still at Arsenal. “He is the only one who can assess the situation. A player like that is always solicited by other clubs and always has to assess his situation. “He was until now a real top leader at Tottenham. He’s a top leader in the English national team. I respect his commitment and his quality. “What I like today is he could play basically as a number 10 because the quality of his assists and the speed of his vision, and the execution of his speed on long balls is exceptional.”
