The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Ogun State, has admonished the new Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, not to allow himself to be used as tool to witch-hunt anybody. This was contained in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Sunday by the Ogun State Chairman of NANS, Damilola Simeon. While saying it regards Bawa’s appointment an enviable win for the entire youths and students in this country, the Ogun NANS charged Bawa to perform his responsibilities with utmost sincerity and live up to expectations. “Moreover, all form of witch-hunting charades, sectional investigations and victimisations must be jettisoned. “The EFCC under the new Chairman must refrain from personality targeting and scapegoating activities that may insinuate that Abdulrasheed Bawa was planted to act out a script or victimise some individuals whom he could not nab during his stint as the head of Lagos zonal office,” Simeon said. The students body charged Bawa to avoid power plays, but to rather discharge his duties conscientiously. The statement reads partly: “In addition, we implore the EFCC Chairman to neither get carried away with power nor participate in any untoward scripts against the general interest of the public or succumb to pressure from politicians. “More than ever, the EFCC under your leadership must refuse to be a mere tool for the government but rather be guided by the rule of law, fairness, equity and justice. “The generality of Nigerian youths are counting on you to prove a point that youths and students are ready for sensitive positions. “In conclusion, we wish to reiterate our utmost commitment towards ensuring a crime free society and express our willingness to cooperate with the EFCC and other relevant security agencies to curb crime and its perpetrators in the society over investigations that are impartial, upright and equitable.”
