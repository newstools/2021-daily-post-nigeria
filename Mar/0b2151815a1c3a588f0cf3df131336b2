A video has surfaced online showing some officials of the Benin Republic addressing Nigerians from Yewa axis of Ogun State, who were said to have esacped to the neighbouring country to seek refuge following herdsmen attack. The video was released during the weekend by a traditional ruler from Yewa land. Following the incessant attacks on some communities in Yewa North and Imeko Afon by those suspected to be Fulani herdsmen, scores of Ogun residents were said to have relocated to the French-speaking Benin Republic to seek refuge. DAILY POST recalls that the Ogun State Government had on different occasions said no indigene of Ogun State was a refugee in Benin Republic, even when the Red Cross of Nigeria confirmed mass relocation of Yewa residents to the country. But in the video made available to DAILY POST, scores of Ogun indigenes were seen standing before some officials of the Benin Republic – a woman and some men. According to the video, one of the displaced persons was seen narrating their ordeals to the officials through the aid of an interpreter as the officials could hardly understand English Language. The Nigerian, who spoke in English narrated how they were “forcefully migrated” to Benin Republic as a result of the herdsmen crisis. Asked, the young man explained that many have been killed in Agbon Ojodu and other communities, saying many are still migrating. “It is because of the Fulani people. They are killing the people anyhow, moving from one place to another. They just kill. That is why the people are scared and they moved here,” he said. In the over three minutes video, the woman, who led the Benin Republic officials could be seen asking the man to do a census of the displaced persons by documenting the names of women, children and others.
