Justice M. A. Odegbola of the Oyo State High Court, on Monday, jailed Michael Tosin Lawal, an Uber driver. Lawal pleaded guilty to an amended one count charge bordering on obtaining money by false pretence. He was prosecuted by the Ibadan Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). According to the charge, Lawal in 2020, with intent to defraud, obtained Gift Cards from one Trevor, a white male. EFCC said he falsely represented himself as “Cyndy Tyler”, a white female purportedly based in the United States of America. Justice Odegbola convicted and sentenced Lawal to three months in prison. The judge ordered the convict to restitute $50 to his victim through the EFCC and forfeit items recovered from him to the Federal Government of Nigeria.
