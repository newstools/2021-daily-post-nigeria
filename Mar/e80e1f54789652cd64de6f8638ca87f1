Contrary to information in some quarters, the Osun State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu has revealed that the symptoms that presented from the three persons that have died so far in Ede clinically looked like cholera. Dr. Isamotu in a chat with DAILY POST on Wednesday, however, explained that the cause of the hospitalisation and subsequent deaths of the three persons who were beggars from the Northern part of the country could not be described as cholera until laboratory tests ascertains it to be so. He revealed that their samples have been taken for laboratory analysis and results were still being awaited. According to him, “The symptoms clinically looks like cholera but in medicine, we don’t just speculate and conjure.” “We have taken the samples to the laboratory and are still awaiting results before we can boldly say it is cholera. The laboratory diagnosis must confirm our suspicions first”, he added. The Commissioner also confirmed to DAILY POST that only three casualties have been recorded so far, with one death on Sunday evening and two on Monday. “They were admitted in a health facility in Ede. Six persons have been discharged from the hospital while we have hope of discharging the remaining three this morning. “I have been to Ede to see their Seriki Hausa and we have talked,” he added. DAILY POST recalls that twelve persons who were beggars of northern origin were hospitalised in Ede after eating food reportedly given to them by a yet to be identified person. The incident which occurred at Oke-Gada area in Ede North local government area of the state has thrown the area into confusion, as most residents were suspecting food poisoning and alleging that the beggars have been used for ritual purposes.
