The Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) in Kwara State have arrested one Abdulraheem Jimoh. Jimoh allegedly defilied a 12-year-old girl at the Mayegun area of Alagbado, Ilorin. NAN reports that NSCDC Public Relations Officer, Babawale Zaid, paraded the suspect on Tuesday at the state command. The PRO said Jimoh lured the minor into his shop with N100 and had carnal knowledge of her. The 55-year-old then threatened to kill her if she revealed what happened to anyone. Zaid regretted that such an incident had been on the rise across the states of the federation. The spokesman told reporters that the suspect would be charged to court soon.
