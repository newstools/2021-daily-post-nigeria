Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has dismissed speculation linking Timo Werner with a move away from the club this summer. The Germany striker was signed in a £47.5 million deal from RB Leipzig last year. Werner has struggled over the winter period with just one goal in his last 26 games for Chelsea. He has been linked with a return to the Bundesliga, with Chelsea reportedly targeting Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland. But Tuchel is backing the 25-year-old to start hitting the target for Chelsea. “Stop reading! What do you read? Read a book,” Tuchel replied when asked about the reports linking Werner with a transfer. “For Timo, I think he has no reason now to be frustrated because he did an amazing match against Liverpool, maybe his best match since I arrived. “Then he had a good match against Everton with a lot of chances to score, which he normally is clinical enough and strong enough to score. “He did not score, okay, this sticks in a situation like this, this can affect his self-confidence, yeah, of course. But what does it help? “The clear advice from us is, don’t focus on the result, focus on the process. Get your decision-making right, get your technique right, take good decisions, for the decision take the right technique and the ball will do the rest, and the opponent’s goalkeeper will do the rest, either it’s in or he does an amazing save.”
