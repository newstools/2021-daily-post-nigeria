Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has defended Harry Maguire for “digging out” his team-mates during the 1-0 win over West Ham. Maguire was heard screaming at right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka, “F****** tidy up, stop giving the f****** ball away”, after a string of errors from the defender. United struggled to produce their best form and only won, thanks to Craig Dawson’s own goal. Solskjaer was happy that Maguire laid into his team-mates over their sloppiness in order to help them “calm down”. He told BBC: “They all needed it. Either digging out or calming down. Maybe it was more calming down because I know the attitude was there. “We wanted so much to recover from what happened on Thursday night, with the last-minute equaliser from Milan, and the attitude was spot on – just calm down and trust yourselves. “We need to be more clinical – that helps me as well with my heart. Fortunately, we defended fantastically. “Dean Henderson did not have a save to make and I guess that is a good sign.”
