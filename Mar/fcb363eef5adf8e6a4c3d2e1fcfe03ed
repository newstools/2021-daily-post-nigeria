Chelsea will sell five of their top players this summer as they look forward to acquiring the services of Borussia Dortmund striker, Erling Haaland, Gini Donnarumma and Kingsley Coman. Despite the club’s improvement under new tactician, Thomas Tuchel, the squad still needs a few more players to position them as strong contenders for the Premier League and the Champions League. However, due to FIFA financial fair play, the Blues will need to sell some players before bringing in top strikers such as Haaland. The Daily Star reports that the west London side wants to complete the squad with Gini Donnarumma, Erling Haaland and Kingsley Coman this summer. These players will cost Thomas Tuchel’s side over €200m hence the move to sell senior players to raise the fund. The players to be sold include Christian Pulisic, Tammy Abraham, Fikayo Tomori, Kepa and Emerson. Chelsea are now 12 matches unbeaten since Tuchel took over from Frank Lampard in January.
