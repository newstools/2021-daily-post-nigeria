The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA,has described as a global disgrace the decision by President Muhammadu Buhari to receive medical attention abroad. DAILY POST had reported that the president on Tuesday afternoon departed Nigeria for the United Kingdom for a medical check-up. According to the presidency, Buhari is expected to return to the country in the second week of April. Reacting to the trip, HURIWA said that Buhari’s continuous travel to London with public funds for his health issues is “regrettable and shameful”. HURIWA’s reaction was contained in a statement issued on Tuesday by its National Coordinator Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko and the National Media Affairs Director Miss Zainab Yusuf. According to the statement, the “unwise choice of the President to patronize foreign health service providers in total rejection and disregard for the Nigerian indigenous health service professionals shows that his administration is hypocritical about achieving any kinds of mileage in the area of rebuilding the near moribund health care sector of the Nation’s economy.” HURIWA stated that the decision by Nigerian Politicians to always patronize foreign medical facilities and health workers is a “shame which demonstrates their lack of commitments to establish functional health care infrastructure to benefit millions of Nigerians”.
