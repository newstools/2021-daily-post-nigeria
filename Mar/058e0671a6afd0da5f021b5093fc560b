A former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has revealed that the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is different from the one influenced by the American businessman and software developer, Bill Gates. Fani-Kayode who took the vaccine at the National Hospital in Abuja on Tuesday made the revelation on Wednesday via a series of tweets on his verified Twitter handle. The 60-year-old Nigerian politician, said the AstraZeneca vaccines are safe, adding that they have been tested and administered successfully in other parts of the world. The tweets read: “The COVID-19 vaccines we are taking in Nigeria are not Bill Gates’ vaccines and neither are we being used as Guinea pigs. “These are tried & tested, have already been approved & have been administered successfully throughout the world. This is the Oxford AstraZeneca brand. “There is a world of difference between what we are being given in Nigeria & the exploratory vaccines that @WHO had wanted to test Africans with which we spoke against & resisted last year. “Most importantly, Bill Gates & his foundation have no connection with Oxford “I would not touch anything Bill Gates with a barge pole for obvious reasons. Mark it”.
