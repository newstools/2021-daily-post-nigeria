Uruguay’s assistant coach, Mario Rebollo, has urged Manchester United striker, Edinson Cavani, to leave Old Trafford and moved to Boca Juniors. Cavani has been heavily linked with a return to South America despite joining Man United on a free transfer last October from Paris Saint-Germain. The 34-year-old’s father, Luis, has hit out at his treatment at Man United and claimed the former Paris Saint-Germain star wants to be “comfortable” as he talked up a summer exit. However, speaking on the development, Rebollo told 2 De Punta, “It helps the national team if Cavani goes to Boca or wherever. “The priority is that he plays where he is comfortable and with a good competitive level. If he’s close to here, it’d be great, but if he’s not comfortable, he will not bear it much. “It would be good for us if Cavani plays where he feels most comfortable. It makes no difference to me if it’s Boca or another place where he’s better. “We have to have him with rhythm and competition.” Cavani has scored 51 goals for Uruguay national team and helped the country win the Copa America a decade ago.
