The Police in Zamfara on Saturday said individuals and groups against peaceful coexistence were spreading unfounded information. Mohammed Shehu, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state said news about the security situation of the state were causing apprehension and confusion. Shehu noted that the Police “as a lead agency in internal security is in a better position to give accurate crime statistics of the state”. The spokesman condemned alleged attempts to “undermine the efforts of security agencies and the government in tackling the activities of the recalcitrant bandits who refused to embrace the ongoing peace process”. The Police assured it was working with other agencies and the state government to ensure the sustenance of relative calm. Shehu vowed more recovery of arms and ammunition and decisive actions against outlaws and criminals who refuse to renounce criminal activities. Zamfara faces a banditry challenge that has claimed several lives and property in recent years. The federal government has declared a no-fly-zone in the state.
