A convicted internet fraudster, Akinrinmade Adeniyi, who was sentenced to three months imprisonment in Abeokuta, is to forfeit his car, a laptop computer and a phone to the Federal Government. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibadan Zonal Office, said it secured the conviction of Adeniyi on Tuesday for impersonation. He was found guilty of the charge preferred against him by Justice Mohammed Abubakar of the Federal High Court, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The convict had earlier pleaded guilty to the one-count charge of fraudulent impersonation brought against him by the EFCC. But, the court pronounced him guilty of the offence and sent him to jail. Aside from the jail term, the Court also ordered him to refund the sum of USD 500 to his victim. He was also asked to forfeit his Toyota Lexus ES330, one Techno K7 phone, and one HP Laptop to the Federal Government of Nigeria through the EFCC. The items were part of the proceeds derived from his fraudulent act, the EFCC had said.
