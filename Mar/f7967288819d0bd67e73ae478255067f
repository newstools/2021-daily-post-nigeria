Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has said his disciplinary situation with manager Mikel Arteta has been resolved. Aubameyang was dropped from the starting XI for the Gunners’ 2-1 win over Tottenham last Sunday, after he arrived late for the squad’s meet-up before the game. On Wednesday, Arteta said he and Aubameyang have addressed the situation ahead of their Europa League fixture. Nowe, the Gabon striker also insists he is now keen to move on from the incident. “On my own situation, I have spoken with the boss and it’s all done now – we move on,” Aubameyang wrote in his matchday programme notes ahead of Arsenal’s Europa League tie with Olympiacos. “I’m focused on the next game and it’s a big one for us. We fought so hard last Thursday to get in this position, so now it’s time to finish the job.”
