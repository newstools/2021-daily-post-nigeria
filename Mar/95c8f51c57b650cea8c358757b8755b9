Two suspected armed robbers, Jerry Chuckwedu and Tomiwa Olawale, have been nabbed by the police in Ogun State for allegedly robbing a gold merchant. Police said they were arrested on Monday having dispossessed the gold merchant of golden chains and rings valued at N6million at gunpoint. The Ogun State Police Command spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed to DAILY POST that their arrest followed a report lodged at the Ogijo divisional police headquarters by one Abubakar Hassan. Hassan had reported that his brother sent him from Idi Araba in Mushin, Lagos State to deliver some gold chains and rings worth N6million to his customer at Igbo Olomu area of Isawo. But, as he arrived at Isawo, “the said customer, who was already waiting for him, picked him on a motorcycle and took him to a deserted area, where three others were met and they dispossessed him of the jewelries at gunpoint after beating him,” Oyeyemi quoted the victim as saying. The report, it was said, prompted the DPO of Ogijo division, CSP Muhammed Suleiman Baba, into action as he quickly led his detectives to the scene, and the entire area was thoroughly combed. “Their efforts yielded positive results when two amongst the gang were arrested as others escaped with their arms. “Three golden rings valued at three million, one hundred and twenty one thousand seven hundred naira (N3,121,700) were recovered from them,” the PPRO explained, adding that the Commissioner of Police, Edward Awolowo Ajogun has ordered that the suspects be investigated at the State CIID. The CP had also directed that the fleeing members of the gang be hunted for.
