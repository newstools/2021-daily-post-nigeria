Bruno Fernandes is refusing to put pen to paper on a new five-year contract at Manchester United, unless he is given assurances about future transfer plans, the UK Sun reports. Fernandes has become one of United’s most important players since joining from Sporting Lisbon in January 2019. The Portugal international has scored 35 goals and provided 21 assists in 63 appearances in all competitions. Fernandes, 26, signed a five-and-a-half year deal worth £100,000-a-week when he joined United and he has been offered a new five-year contract which would see his wages increase to £200,000-a-week. However, it is believed that Fernandes wants to know how the club plans to continue making progress before he commits. United will continue their hunt for silverware this Thursday, when they host AC Milan in the Europa League last 16.
