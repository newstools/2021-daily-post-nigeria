The Senate has commenced moves to unbundle the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) with the consideration of a bill to repeal the Nigerian Postal Service Act 2004. The bill, which scaled second reading on Tuesday, was sponsored by Senator Oluremi Tinubu (APC, Lagos Central). Tinubu said the legislation seeks a reform of the Postal Industry and to make Comprehensive Provisions for the Development and Regulation of Postal Services in Nigeria. The lawmaker recalled NIPOST dates back 1852 and evolved from an exigency of the colonial administration to a Collection Office of the United Kingdom. Tinubu said as at when Nigeria gained independence, there were 176 Post Offices, 10 Sub-Post Offices and 1000 Postal Agencies. The agency presently has 955 post offices and more than three thousand 3,000 Postal Agencies in the thirty-six states. The lawmaker observed that in view of existing realities, it had become imperative for the NIPOST Act to be reviewed to guarantee improved efficiency and service. The bill covers implementation of a National Postal Policy, encourages local and foreign investment, ensures the protection of rights and interests of service providers, promotes small and medium enterprises in the sector, among others. It also provides for the establishment of the Nigerian Postal Service and designates it as Public Postal Operator (PPO), a corporate body with a common seal whose responsibility includes the provision of Universal Postal Services in Nigeria. Tinubu said clear delineation of roles will make NIPOST more commercially viable and efficient in service delivery. The bill seeks establishment of the Nigerian Postal Commission to regulate and supervise the Postal Sector. Senate President Ahmad Lawan directed the Committee on Communications to work on the provisions. A report is expected in four weeks.
