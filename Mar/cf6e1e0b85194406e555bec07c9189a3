The Leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has spoken about the Anambra governorship election coming up later in 2021. The prophet has warned some strong contenders in the election not to bother wasting money on campaigns because God has not backed their aspiration to become governor in the state. The man of God prophesied that Paul Orajiaka, Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Uche Ekwunife, Godwin Ezeemo from All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, cannot be governor come 2021. In a statement to DAILY POST, Ayodele said God has not anointed any of them to be governor in the state. He asked them to channel their money into helping the less privileged and widows in society. “On Anambra 2021, I want to advise Paul Orajiaka, Andy Uba from APC, Uche Ekwunife, Godwin Ezeemo from APGA not to bother about governing the state. They don’t have God’s backing, instead of wasting money in a campaign, they should channel their money into humanitarian activities like Giving the less privileged and widows in the society”
