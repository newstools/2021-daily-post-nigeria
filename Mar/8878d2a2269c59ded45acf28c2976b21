Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has re-emphasized that the insecurity in Nigeria will persist until the federal government apologizes to the state. Governor Wike said this during the commissioning of the Government House clinic in Port Harcourt. He said the All Progressives Congress-led Federal government abandoned Rivers State during its trying time of insecurity. “In 2015, when we came on board there was so much insecurity in the State. I was shouting, I went to the federal government, I said, look give me Special Forces as I hear you give to others they said no, that I was killing APC people. “So, I came back and told our people and that we need to pray that this insecurity will pervade the whole of Nigeria and Nigeria will not know what to do again. “And I told them that if they do not apologize to Rivers State, they will never see peace. And that is what is happening in the country today; because they felt this State should go down. “Today what is happening in Kaduna, today what is happening in Borno, today what is happening in Ondo, what is happening in all the areas. But Rivers State is peaceful,” Wike said. On the commissioned project, Governor Wike said the hospital which will be open to elder statesmen, judges, lawmakers and government house workers who can afford the services of the hospital, will not be free of charge. Commissioning the project, former Senate President, Bukola Saraki described Governor Wike as one of the most sought after politician in Nigeria.
