Following the verdict of the Federal High Court in Abuja which sacked the lawmaker representing Ibaji Constituency in the Kogi State House of Assembly, Atule Egbunu, the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) on Monday, officially presented the Certificate of Return to Hon. Daniel Enefola Ojata of the Peoples Democratic Party. The presentation of the certificate of return was done by the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Prof James Apam at the INEC headquarters in Lokoja. DAILY POST recalls that Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday, 29th January, 2021 ordered the removal of Mr Egbunu, an All Progressives Congress (APC) member, and directed that he be replaced with the candidate of the party with the next highest votes in the December 5, 2020 by-election in the constituency. Daniel Enefola polled 4, 565 votes in the December 5, 2020 by-election coming second behind Mr Egbunu of the APC who polled 8,515 votes in the said by-election. His removal as the lawmaker representing Ibaji was sequel to a suit filed by a member of the ruling All Progressive Congress, (APC) in the State, Mr Joseph Enemona. The plaintiff ( Enemona) challenged the nomination of the sacked lawmaker, Mr Egbunu, as the partyâ€™s candidate for the by-election after the demise of a two time lawmaker in the constituency, Hon. John Abbah. The plaintiff who had sought to contest for the APC ticket with Mr Egbunu and five others, alleged in his suit that the party ( APC) failed to hold any primary election. According to the plaintiff in his suit, the organisers of the purported APC primary election came to the venue with a prepared result and deprived him and his agents of entry. He also claimed that the party failed to file to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) the 21-day notice for the primary election as stipulated under section 85(1) of the Electoral Act.
