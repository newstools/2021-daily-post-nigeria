The Federal Government says it is untrue that N10.6 billion will be spent to distribute COVID-19 vaccines. The 3.9 million doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines are to be shared among the 36 states in the country and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Faisal Shuaib, Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), told reporters that the government would not bear the transportation costs. He explained that the private sector-led Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) would be in charge of distributing the vaccines nationwide. The official confirmed that the body has provided a cargo plane for delivery to all states with functional airports. ”For those that do not have functional airports, there is a delivery van that will convey the vaccines from those airports to the states without functionality. “I do not see how that is going to cost N10 billion. So there is no truth in that information. ”The only cost we’re going to incur is the cost of delivering the vaccines from any airport to nearby states that don’t have functional airports”, he said.
