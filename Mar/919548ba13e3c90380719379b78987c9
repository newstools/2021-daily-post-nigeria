Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has demanded answers from the Premier League on the use of VAR. City were denied a penalty, after Phil Foden was felled by Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy during their 5-2 win on Wednesday. Guardiola was left furious at the decision, made with the score still at 1-1. “The VAR, oh my God. The penalty is incredible. The action, I don’t understand. “Maybe they [the league] will explain one day. Hopefully they can explain what is going on. “The referees are professionals. They have to do their jobs. I don’t see how Arsenal, the handball, against Burnley, is disallowed. Fulham in the Tottenham game. Explain it. Incredible. “Tonight, the referee Jon [Moss] cannot see the foul, that can happen, but the VAR? You have to ask the right people why,” Guardiola said.
