The All Progressives Congress (APC) has commended the judiciary for convicting a Returning Officer for electoral fraud. Recall that a High Court in Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom State on Thursday, sentenced a professor of the University of Calabar, Peter Ogban, to three years in prison for announcing false election result in favour of the APC candidate, Godswill Akpabio during the Akwa Ibom North-West Senatorial District election in 2019. Ogban who was the Independent National Electoral Commission’s Returning Officer for the 2019 Akwa Ibom North-West Senatorial poll was said to have manipulated the result in favour of the APC candidate, Godswill Akpabio who was seeking re-election to the Senate. A statement by Mr Yekini Nabena, APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary, said justice will always prevail under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. Nabena said the court has finally vindicated the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Sen. Godswill Akpabio and the ruling party. The Akwa Ibom North-West senatorial election was fraudulently postponed by the returning officer against the wish of the APC and its candidate. Nabena called on Nigerians to disregard the attempt by the PDP and its sponsored agents to misinform the general public on the real issues and the court verdict. “We celebrate the court’s pronouncement jailing one of the agents of the PDP, used against our candidate (Akpabio) in the Senatorial election in Akwa Ibom North-West in 2019. “We always believe that if a lie goes for 20 years, the truth will meet up with it one day. “This judgment is significant in the sense that others like Ogban in the system, should henceforth know that under the present APC-led Federal Government, justice will always prevail,’’ NAN quoted him saying.
