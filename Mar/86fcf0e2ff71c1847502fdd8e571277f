The Delta State Branch of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, CDHR has said no local government election was held in Igbudu Community Ward 9 in Warri South Local Government Area. The CDHR, Comrade Jonathan Giama said this during a chat with newsmen in Warri. He said, “There were no elections in Igbudu Ward 9. There were no electoral materials. Nobody(electoral officers) on the ground for the election.” While noting that the election held in other units, Comrade Giama said, “I just came back from there now”. Comrade Giama claimed that the Delta State Independent Electoral Commission, DSIEC denied its members assess to monitor/observe the local government elections in the state. He explained that the organization applied early to monitor the election but they were denied because they knew their reports wouldn’t be favourable and friendly to them. He said, “This is due to the poor management of DSIEC in handling the issues of local government election. INEC should be allowed to conduct local government election to stop all this selection of candidates. This will bring proper democracy.
