The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has told the Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle, to disclose the identities of those behind the recent kidnappings in the state. On Sunday, Matawalle told the 17 Emirs in the state, who paid him a sympathy visit over the abduction of the Government Girls’ Secondary School in Jangebe, that Nigerians would be shocked to know people behind the abduction of the girls. In reaction to the governor’s remark in a statement released on Tuesday, ACF Chairman, Audu Ogbeh, described Matawalle‘s allegation as an embarrassment to the north. Ogbeh warned against such unguarded statements by those in power. “The Arewa Consultative Forum ACF is stunned by a statement accredited to the Zamfara Governor, Bello Matawalle. “We ask the governor to reveal their identity and let Nigerians be shocked or even the heavens fall,” the statement read in part. It added: “People in positions of authority that will help us out of this mess like Governor Matawalle must stop embarrassing the north and country with careless statements on a serious issue like the kidnappings of school children.”
