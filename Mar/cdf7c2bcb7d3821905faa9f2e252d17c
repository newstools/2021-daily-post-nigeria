Abia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu has said that his administration will ensure that it completes and commissionâ€™s the Abiriba Ring Road. The Governor stated this on Wednesday while addressing the 2nd Town Hall Meeting with the Abiriba Community in Aba held at the Abiriba Hall, Jubilee Road, Aba. He also promised to donate 150 units of Solar Powered Street lights for installation along the main road that leads into the Abiriba Community. The Governor revealed that the State will soon take delivery of a tunneling machine to be deployed for the Aba flood management project. According to him, the machine will handle underground tunneling and storm water management around Ngwa, Portharcourt, Ohanku roads and environs. He further disclosed that the underground work to be done in the area with the tunneling machine measures 17 metres beneath, hence, no building in the area would be pulled down as a result of the work. Ikpeazu assured that his successor would no longer need to reclaim the area adding that he would do more roads in the days ahead. He revealed that his administration would build a health village at the Aba General hospital premises and informed that over 600 classroom blocks have been built across the state, while model schools have also been constructed to boost education in the State. The Governor commended the Abiriba people for their sustained support to his administration and their contributions to the State economy.
