Suleiman Ajadi, a former Senator representing Kwara South, says the herdsmen crisis has external influence. He advised leaders of herders across Nigeria to fish out the bad elements among them. In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Ajayi recalled cattle owners lived with other tribes without rancour. The ex-lawmaker condemned kidnapping, rape, encroachment of farm lands, possession of AK47 rifles, among other negative acts. “The herdsmen l know and interacted with from my childhood cannot engage in any criminal act or destroy farms, carrying AK47.” Ajadi wondered why some herdsmen turned agents of destruction. “The implication is that some herdsmen from other countries, who have criminal acts with sophisticated weapons, have been accommodated among them,” he said.
