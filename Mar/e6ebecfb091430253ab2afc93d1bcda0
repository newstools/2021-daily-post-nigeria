The Obong of Calabar and custodian of the Efik Kingdom, His Eminence, Edidem Ekpo Okon Abasi V has been vaccinated with AstraZeneca Vaccine. Speaking shortly after taking the vaccine, the Obong thanked the health team for deeming it necessary to visit the throne to get the entire cabinet vaccinated. He maintained that with the traditional stool having undergone the vaccination, the event will present his subjects with the moral fibre and a sense of belief to avail themselves for vaccination. The monarch called on all residents of the State to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, as Cross River (nay Nigeria) is too mature to buckle under the stereotype against the AstraZeneca Vaccine. Also speaking, the Director-General of the Cross River State Health Insurance Agency, Sir Godwin Iyala, another frontline worker who took the vaccine, said the vaccination has given him a sense of protection, as it was done in fulfilment of the requirement to stay safe from covid-19, adding: “I urge everybody to follow suit.” Another prominent frontline worker who took the vaccine was the Director-General, Cross River State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr. Janet Ekpenyong. She pointed out that her decision to join the royal fathers in taking the vaccine was to allay the fears arising from stereotypes and other concerns. Dr Ekpenyong restated the State Government’s commitment to the health and safety of its citizens and called on Cross Riverians and residents of the State to take advantage of the availability of the AstraZeneca vaccine and get fortified against the dreaded pandemic that has ravaged the entire world.
