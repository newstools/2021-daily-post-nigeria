Isikia Wakili, one of the most wanted Fulani herdsmen reportedly killed, is still alive. This is contrary to earlier claim by the Co-coordinator of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association in Kwara State chapter, Aliyu Mohammed that Wakili had been killed. However, fresh report reaching DAILY POST indicated that Wakili was actually arrested by a vigilante group at Kajola village in Ibarapa Local Government Area of Oyo state in the early hours of Sunday and not killed as earlier claimed by Mohammed. He was handed over to the police authorities after his arrest. It was gathered that two people were reportedly killed in the operation to arrest Wakili who had been on the wanted list for alleged kidnapping offences. The identities of those allegedly killed, could not be verified at the time of this report. The latest development is coming some weeks after the Sarkin Fulani Salihu Abdulkadir was evicted from Igangan town by Sunday Igboho and his group over alleged kidnapping and killings by his people. Salihu, had since relocated to Ilorin, Kwara State capital with his people following his eviction from Igangan town.
