As frontline workers, journalists in Ogun State will start receiving the Astrazeneca Covid-19 vaccine at the NUJ Secretariat, Iwe-Iroyin, Abeokuta. A statement by the Chief of Staff to Governor Dapo Abiodun, Kunle Somorin, said the vaccination for journalists will start on Friday, March 19. Somorin noted that Gov Abiodun had decided to treat journalists specially because their profession exposes them so much to the deadly virus. He likened pressmen to health workers and security agents, who he said were always on the road when other people stay at home, especially during lockdown. However, it was disclosed that only journalists who have registered for the vaccine online would be attended to by health workers, from 10am to 5pm on Friday at Iwe-Iroyin. Somorin added that a print out of the online registration details would be required for record purposes.
