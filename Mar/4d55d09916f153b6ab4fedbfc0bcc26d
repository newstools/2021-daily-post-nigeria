The Anambra State command of the Nigeria Correctional Services (NCoS) has confirmed that it lost one officer in an attack that happened on Friday at Ekwulobia, by unknown gunmen. The NCoS also said that it lost one inmate, who was seized by the attackers and taken away, after a gun duel that lasted for 10 minutes. A press release by DSC Francis Ekezie, stated that, “Gunmen yet to be identified attacked the court duty Vehicle of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Anambra State at Nanka while conveying inmates back from court to the Aguata custodial centre. The attackers killed the Corrections officer and whisked away the inmate being taken back to the Custodial Centre. “The gun duel that lasted for about 10 minutes was reportedly perpetrated by suspected hoodlums in two vehicles, a Sienna bus and a Hilux pick-up that trailed the court duty Vehicle from the court premises. “Although the armed escort put up a gallant resistance, he was unfortunately overpowered by the hoodlums who came in their numbers with sophisticated weapons.” Meanwhile, the body of the fallen officer has been deposited in the mortuary awaiting further necessary action. Ekezie quoted the state Comptroller, Nwakeze Emmanuel as expressing deep shock over the incident, but advised the public and officers and men of the command to remain calm as investigations have commenced with the collaboration of other security agencies. Nwakeze also appealed to members of the public to avail security agencies with useful intelligence that will lead to the arrest of those behind the dastardly act.
