Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger, has named Joao Felix as the Atletico Madrid player he enjoys watching in action. According to Rudiger, he loves to watch Felix play for Diego Simeone’s side because the Portugal youngster is a ‘special player with ‘technique’. The Germany international said this on Tuesday ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League last-16 second-leg tie with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night at Stamford Bridge. “The [Atletico Madrid] attack is not only Luis Suarez, but it is also Joao Felix who is a great talent and a good young prospect,” Rudiger told a pre-match press conference. “He is a different type of player but a player I love to watch because of his technique. “He has something special.” The kick-off time for Chelsea vs Atletico Madrid is 9 pm.
