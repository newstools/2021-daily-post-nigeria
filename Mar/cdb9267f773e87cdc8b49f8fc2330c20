Cristiano Ronaldo netted a perfect hat-trick as Juventus beat Cagliari 3-1 on Sunday. The 36-year-old scored all three goals within 32 minutes. That makes it the second-fastest hat-trick of his career. Ronaldo rose highest to meet a Juan Cuadrado corner to send a trademark bullet header past Alessio Cragno. And 15 minutes later, Cragno was helpless again as he fouled the Portuguese forward inside the box. Ronaldo stepped up and hammered the ball down the middle after picking himself up. Then Federico Chiesa found him on the right flank, and after cutting inside on his left, Ronaldo found the top corner with an unstoppable effort. The hosts then pulled one back, when Gabriele Zappa picked out Giovanni Simeone inside the box.
