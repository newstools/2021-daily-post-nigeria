Vice President Yemi Osinbajo says Nigerians would require a visa to Kano if Nigeria broke up. The VP made the remark at the 12th Colloquium to mark the 69th birthday of former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu. Osinbajo said with the birthday celebration in Kano, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has helped to tell two stories. He said it was the first time colloquium is being hosted outside Lagos and Abuja, the nation’s capital. Osinbajo described Kano as the city of radical and progressive ideas and ideologies, with some of the leading political lights in the All Progressives Congress (APC). He added that the celebration has underscored the point that Nigeria and its people are stronger and more powerful together than apart. Osinbajo further kicked against purveyors of the country’s break up into components or regions. “They should be reminded that we would not have been able to accept Governor Ganduje’s offer to come to Kano at short notice, since we would all have needed visas to come to Kano”, he said.
