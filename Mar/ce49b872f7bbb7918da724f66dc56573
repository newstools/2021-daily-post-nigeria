Suspected gunmen have kidnapped a staff of the Ado Local Government, Ekiti State, Mrs. Funmilola Osalusi and took her to an unknown destination. The widow is the wife of the late Surveyor-General of Ekiti State, Mr. Felix Oladapo Osalusi, who died barely a year ago. Explaining how the incident happened, Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, ASP Sunday Abutu, said the woman was abducted yesterday by three gun-wielding men. The PPRO added that the incident occurred at Mrs Osalusi’s residence located behind the office of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Federal Polytechnic road, Ado Ekiti metropolis. Abutu said the incident happened around 9:20pm, when the woman was said to have been tricked by abductors out of the gate and silently ferried away in their car. “The armed men numbering three were said to have knocked on the gate of the victim’s residence and tricked her outside. “She was said to have come out of the gate to ascertain the identities of the guests and as she did that, the gunmen were said to have quietly taken her away in their vehicle”. Abutu said the Police Commissioner, Babatunde Mobayo had deployed detectives to suspected bushes where the woman was taken to rescue her out of the kidnappers’ den. Abutu added that the police would work with operatives of the Amotekun corps, local hunters, the vigilante Group of Nigeria and other stakeholders to rescue the widow from the captivity.
