The Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) has confirmed the dates for Nigeria’s Africa Cup of Nations 2022 qualifiers against the Republic of Benin and Lesotho. The Super Eagles will play their last two fixtures in the series later this month. Nigeria will take on Benin on March 27 and Lesotho on March 30. The match against the Squirrels will be played in Porto Novo with the kick-off set at 5pm. Gernot Rohr’s men will then welcome Lesotho at the Teslim Balogun Stadium three days later, with kick-off also slated for 5pm. Nigeria have picked up eight points from their first four games in Group L and need just a point from their last two games to seal qualification.
