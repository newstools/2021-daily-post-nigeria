Chelsea manager, Mason Mount, has credited new manager Thomas Tuchel for lighting a fire inside him. Tuchel put himself in the spotlight after replacing Frank Lampard in January, when he left Mount on the bench for his first match against Wolves. But the 22-year-old feels it has been one of the best things to happen. “I’ve had that experience before. “I was on loan at Vitesse Arnhem when I was 18, 19. That first couple of months I didn’t play hardly at all. “I had that motivation and that fire to want to get into the team. The first game with the manager coming in, he went for a more experienced team. “I understood that and wanted to get back into the team, so that motivation and that fire that I have inside me came out. “I really tried to push to get back into the team. It’s been brilliant. We are working very hard. We’ve had tough games in this last period but we have come through it. It’s exciting stuff, we continue to work hard. It’s been a great start,” Mount said.
