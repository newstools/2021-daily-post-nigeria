Recall that DAILY POST in a quest to ascertain the causes of increasing rate of divorce in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja and other states, gathered that desperate and chronic single ladies have uncovered a ‘fetish’ means of snatching husbands.

The product, a sex and love enhancer originally meant to bond couples has been misconstrued and abused by women who are in desperate need of man or cash. Reacting to the allegation, Jaruma, opined that cross-dressers in Nigeria are responsible for the high rate of divorce in Nigeria. She explained on her Instagram page that cross-dressers in the country are known for saying they will ‘take away married men from their wives. ”News was all over town that the high rate of divorce has been linked and traced to Kayan mata because single girls are now buying Kayan mata and now taking away married men from their wives. ”There is only one Kayan Mata, the original from the North. Have you ever heard me say we are taking your husbands away from you? Have you ever heard me say we are coming to take your husbands away? ”Original Hausa Kayan Mata from the North, we are home-makers. We are not home breakers. The high rate of divorce can only be linked to cross-dressers because they always say, ‘We are coming to take your husbands, that is their motto,” She added.
