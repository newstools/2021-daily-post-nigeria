Manchester United striker, Edinson Cavani, has responded to speculation he’s set to quit the club at the end of the season. Cavani, in an Instagram post, insisted he is “proud” to wear the club’s shirt. Reports on Monday claimed the Uruguayan was eyeing a move to Boca Juniors this summer, as he had struggled to settle at Old Trafford. Cavani has proven to be a hit at Old Trafford and United are keen to extend his stay at the club by 12 months. However, the player has dampened talk by posting “Proud to wear this shirt”. The post was accompanied with a handshake emoji and Cavani tagged Manchester United.
