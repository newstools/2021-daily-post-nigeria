Oyo Governor, Seyi Makinde, on Saturday, vowed to end the trend of former governors of the state shunning their successors’ inauguration. Makinde made the promise at the induction of the 8th President of Christ Apostolic Church Worldwide, Pastor Samuel Olusegun Oladele. The event was held at All Saints Chapel, C.A.C. General Secretariat, Bashorun in Ibadan. The Oyo helmsman said politicians need to learn how to conduct rancour-free elections, handing over power and ensuring continuity. “If you look at all the past governors, none of them has handed over to the successor. From Alhaji Lam Adesina to Baba Ladoja; from Baba Ladoja to Governor Akala; from Governor Akala to Governor Ajimobi; from Ajimobi to me, no hand over. “But because we are having a new beginning, and as I am standing on the altar of the Almighty, I will be the first governor to hand over to a successor in Oyo State.” Makinde called for unity in the Church and the country. He noted that Nigeria is currently at a crossroad. “The issues of insecurity, banditry, ethnic clashes everywhere. We know that the leadership of the church or political leaders did not drop from heaven as we are also from this society. “The new (CAC) president has said his priority is to end the crisis of division. I think as a nation and people, we, also, from this day, should make it a priority to end the crisis of division in Nigeria”, he said.
