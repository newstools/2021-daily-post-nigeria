All the six people in a tightly packed 5-seater Corolla Starlet car died following a road crash in Adamawa State on Sunday evening. The accident occurred near a community called Jabbo-Lamba in Girei Local Government Area, along Yola-Mubi highway, when the cab crashed into a Sienna bus. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Adamawa State, DSP Sulaiman, said the accident occurred around 4:00pm. “All the six passengers in the Starlet, including the driver, died on the spot, while the driver of the Sienna bus who was alone sustained serious injury,” Nguroje said. He added that the Adamawa State Police Commissioner, CP Aliyu Adamu Alhaji, had ordered the immediate investigation on the accident. In Adamawa State where Keke NAPEP is the mode of intracity commercial transport, especially in the major towns, Starlet cars constitute the mode of inter-city commercial travel, and accidents are common on the highways as the drivers of the cars are often accused of overspeeding.
