Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has said Northern Christians have nothing to worry about concerning Nigeria’s disintegration. Kanu declared that the Northern Christian community would be granted political asylum in Biafra when it cedes from Nigeria. He stressed that Biafra would not allow Christian communities in the North to be decimated by Sharia. The IPOB leader stated this in a statement by the group’s spokesman, Emma Powerful. The statement reads: “We the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, under the leadership of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, wants to inform Christian communities in Northern Nigeria that they have nothing to worry about in a disintegrated Nigeria. “Our leader made this solemn pledge while assuring them that they will be granted automatic settlement rights in the new Biafra when Nigeria finally implodes as every other failed state before it has done. “Biafra will not allow Northern Christians who are currently at the mercy of marauding Fulani Islamic terrorists to be roasted by the Janjaweed Sharia North that is eager to decimate indigenous communities of Northern Nigeria. “Our leader has assured them under divine oath that any Northern Christian willing to live in Biafra land can come and settle. Northern Christians shall be granted political asylum in Nigeria to pursue their legitimate careers.”
