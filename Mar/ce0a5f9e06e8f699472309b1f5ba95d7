Fulani herdsmen have claimed that the government supplies them with weapons. In a viral video recorded during one of the several meetings between popular Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, one of the herdsmen, addressing the crowd, pointed out that cows don’t give birth to guns. He said that they were only herdsmen and did not know what guns were until the government started supplying them with AK-47. “I swear to the Almighty Allah that it’s the government that is giving arms to us. Fulani don’t know what gun is,” he said in Fulani to the applause of others. “We are only herdsmen. Cows don’t give birth to guns. I swear to Allah, we are on our own and the government supplies AK47 to us. I am not afraid to say the truth.” Sheikh Gumi has been visiting forests across the North where he is meeting with armed Fulani bandits. The Islamic teacher is also calling on the government to grant the bandits amnesty, a move he believes will end the kidnappings and killings in the region.
