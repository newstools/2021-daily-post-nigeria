Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, Deputy President of the Senate, has cautioned the All Progressives Congress(APC) against repeating past mistakes of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Omo-Agege said Nigerians have come of age in terms of political maturity and that politicians and parties must deliver on their promises “or face removal, just as it happened in 2015”. The DSP spoke at the APC South-South Town Hall Meeting for Constitution Review in Asaba, Delta State. The lawmaker explained that the move to review the APC constitution was to make it a people-oriented platform with equal opportunities for all members. Omo-Agege told the gathering that APC is the first-ever opposition to unseat an incumbent party in the history of Nigeria. “Fellow party men, remember that the PDP had confidently said that it would be in power for 60 years. It took the resolve and determination of a strong-willed nation and its people to upstage that confidence. “Now there is a lesson that we must bear in our subconscious and which should give centrality to our thoughts and deeds,” he said. Omo-Agege added that the APC must provide a constitution that is fully integrative not only of the obligation and responsibilities of party men and women but also of their rights.
