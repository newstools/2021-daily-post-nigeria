The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila has admonished Nigerians not to play politics with the COVID-19 vaccines. He warned that allowing conspiracy to thrive will affect the successful rollout of the vaccines. Gbajabiamila made the call during the Flag-off of COVID-19 Vaccination in Nigeria on Friday. Nigeria had taken on delivery of four million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab COVID-19 vaccines on Tuesday. “We must not play politics with vaccines; we must not play politics with the health of our neighbour; we must be on the same page whilst we also correct and do what you need to do in terms of your role in checking the government and holding their feet to the fire”, Gbajabiamila said. He added, “Therefore when a country goes to war, you go as one. I want to implore the journalists and implore all Nigerians, therefore, not to give in to conspiracy theories because we will hear them.” He called on everyone to rally behind the government to fight the pandemic.
