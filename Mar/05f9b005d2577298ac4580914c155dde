The Amalgamated Union of Foodstuff and Cattle Dealers of Nigeria (AUFCDN) has resolved to end the blockade of supplies to the south. Leadership of the union reached the agreement on Wednesday during a meeting with Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and the former Minister of aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode. President of the union, Mohammed Tahir and Chairmen of the Union across the 36 states of the Federation and the FCT and critical stakeholders were all at the meeting. Tahir, who addressed newsmen shortly after the meeting, commended Governor Bello for wading into the crisis and ensuring that it was resolved amicably. According to him, the Governor has demonstrated leadership which both parties greatly appreciated and have decided to return to their normal business. “With this development, the Union members will commence the movement of their products especially cattle, vegetables and other foodstuffs to the Southern part of Nigeria and vice versa”, he stated. DAILY POST recalls that the dealers had embarked on an indefinite strike, vowing not to supply food items to the South as a protest against alleged maltreatment of Fulani herdsmen and some Northerners residing in the south. The union also demanded compensation of N4.75 billion to its members, over alleged losses incurred during the #EndSARS’ protest and razing of their properties at Shasha market in Oyo State. Reacting, the Association of South East Town Union on Tuesday, said the people of South East are capable of feeding themselves. The National President of the association, Emeka Diwe, and the Secretary, Gideon Adikwuru, in a statement, said it would within a short time put a stop to the capital flight caused by what they called “the imperialism of the northern agro-cartels in Igboland.”
