Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has abandoned his pursuit of Lionel Messi and the whole episode is now seen as “case closed”, according to Sport. ManCity has been seen as favourites to be Messi’s next club, should he make an emotional exit from the Nou Camp this summer. Messi tried to force his way out last summer, but under new manager Ronald Koeman and the returning president Joan Laporta, he appeared to be enjoying his football once more and looked set to stay. City was keen on signing Messi last summer but “they are throwing in the towel, convinced that the Argentine will renew with Barca”. Instead, Guardiola will now look to either Erling Haaland, Romelu Lukaku or Harry Kane to replace the departing Sergio Aguero. The Etihad club confirmed on Monday that all-time leading goalscorer Aguero will move on at the end of the season once his contract expires.
