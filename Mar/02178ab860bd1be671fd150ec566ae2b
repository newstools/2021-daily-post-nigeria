Arsenal players have supported manager Mikel Arteta’s decision to drop captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from the north London derby after he arrived late for duty, SportsMail reports. Aubameyang was furious with Arteta’s decision to remove him from the starting XI just hours before the clash against Tottenham. Nevertheless, it is understood influential members of the squad believe the Spaniard made the correct decision. Aubameyang was caught in traffic on his way to the Emirates Stadium for the game and Arteta deemed his late arrival as unacceptable. The club’s top-earner is said to have been livid and as a result, did not take part in the post-match warm-down with his fellow substitutes and was one of the first players to leave. It is understood that Arteta wanted to make a public stand, partly as a message to his squad, that no one player is bigger than the squad. There have been concerns within the club regarding Aubameyang’s discipline. His time-keeping has been a problem at times this season, while recently the club was forced to look into claims he broke lockdown regulations in order to get a new tattoo.
