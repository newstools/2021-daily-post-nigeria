Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State has insisted that his party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, and President Muhammadu Buhari, have failed to deliver all the campaign promises to Nigerians. Fayemi said APC leaders should take responsibility for the failure to deliver on their campaign promises, insisting that some of the country’s issues were on ground before Buhari’s government. He pointed out that the party failed to deliver on its promises made to Nigerians in the areas of security, anti-corruption, and economic growth. Featuring on Channels Television yesterday, Fayemi said: “I’m not going to shy away from the expectations people had before we came to office. I was a leading player in the campaign that brought my principal ( Buhari) to power. “We promised Nigerians quite a number of things, particularly centering on security, anti-corruption, and on economic growth. Have we been able to attain all of what we promised? Obviously not.” Nigeria has been experiencing serious security challenges with the resurgence of banditry and kidnapping, especially in the Northern part of the country. Amid the security challenges, Nigeria had slipped into recession twice in the last six years under Buhari’s administration.
