Mike Davids has apologized to Apostle Johnson Suleman after accusing him of having sexual relations with his wife. Recall that Davids had in a petition to the Inspector-General of Police, IGP, last month alleged that Apostle Suleman slept with his wife, Faith Edko, in Uyi Hotel, Auchi, Edo State. He also alleged that the pastor was threatening his life and denied him access to his three children. Following the development, Apostle Suleman through his legal team, instituted legal actions against Davids. He also launched a N5bn suit at the Lagos State High Court, Ikeja, against him for “conspiracy to blackmail and defamation of character.” However, Davids in a video released on Wednesday apologized for all the accusations he made against Apostle Suleman. Davids also referred to Suleman as his father in the Lord. He also claimed that he’s been on a “spiritual sojourn” and received instructions from the Lord to apologise to Suleman. “In view of what has happened in the past, after embarking on my “spiritual sojourn” I received instructions from the lord to do what I’m about to do now. “I want to sincerely apologize to my father in the lord Apostle Johnson Suleman for accusing him of sleeping with my wife. “Also, I apologise to Omega Fire Ministries around the world and to Apostle Suleman’s wife for the manner in which i reached out for help. I’m deeply sorry,” he said.
