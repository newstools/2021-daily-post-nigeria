Senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has urged the people of the Southwest region to get ready for their freedom. The cleric, who reiterated this while addressing his members in Akure on Sunday, said nothing can stop Yoruba from getting to its destination. He, however, advised the agitators to put God first in all things and urged them to build Yoruba nation on the solid rock. Giwa noted that part of the reasons nothing works in Nigeria was because the country was established in a crafty manner. “Let me urge the agitators to be transparent and truthful. Above all, they should put God first in all things. “As it is, nothing can stop the freedom of the Yoruba ethic group. However, Oduduwa Republic should not be like Nigeria that was created in a crafty manner. “If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do? They created Nigeria on deceit and nobody knows the meaning of that name, Nigeria. “Yoruba leaders must give their people equal rights, solid constitution. They should be ready to serve the people not to serve themselves. “Freedom is coming soon, and nothing can stop it. Yoruba must all unite to grab this opportunity,” he stated.
