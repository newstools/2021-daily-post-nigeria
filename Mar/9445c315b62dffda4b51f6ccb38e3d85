The leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has declared that politicians in the country will soon be eradicated. He called on President Muhammadu Buhari and every other known politicians in the country to resign, adding that they will soon be on the run. In a lengthy statement to DAILY POST on Monday, the Prophet said that a new Nigeria is coming, explaining that the country might not be the same in 2023. “Nigeria is sinking, the government has failed completely and the issue of herdsmen will cause a lot for us, Buhari doesn’t understand the directive of his government. “This one happening is more than COVID-19, it will consume the nation unexpectedly, I doubt it if Nigeria will do the same in 2023. 2023 will be very serious, we are still joking now. “Our politicians will be on the run when the time comes. New Nigeria is coming. But let us take it easy before it turns to something else “Those politicians that have served before may not be seen again, a new Nigeria is coming. Either we want it or not, it will happen. “It’s the word of God, all of these people will be eradicated completely, it’s not going to be the same but a new Nigeria is coming.”
