Arsenal hero, Paul Merson, has predicted the position Chelsea will finish under their manager, Thomas Tuchel, this season. Merson said that Chelsea are now in “pole position” to finish in the top four position this term under Tuchel. He said this ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash with Leeds United on Saturday. Chelsea are currently in the fourth position on the log with 50 points from 28 games. Merson told Sky Sports: “Chelsea are now in pole position to finish in the top four after a big week of results, but it is not a foregone conclusion. “They have to keep producing right until the end of the season. “There are not too many concerns about injuries at the moment. They have a really good squad, and we have seen it utilised in the last few weeks by Tuchel. [N’Golo] Kante and [Mason] Mount were rested on Monday, Olivier Giroud is on the bench too, and Tammy Abraham is not even getting a look in. “It’s far from job done, though. They need to keep this run going because we’ve already seen this season that things can change very quickly. “West Ham keeps winning, and Tottenham are flying again. It’s lucky Chelsea have been on this brilliant run and are in the position they are in because otherwise, they’d have been out of it.”
