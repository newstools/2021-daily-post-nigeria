Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has named playmaker Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Dan James and Edinson Cavani, as the biggest threats in Manchester United’s team, ahead of Sunday’s Derby. Guardiola feels United are “so strong in all departments”, but named Fernandes and Cavani as players to watch out for. Both Manchester clubs face each other with City looking to maintain their 28-match unbeaten run. United, however, are on a 21-match unbeaten streak in away Premier League matches. “They are so strong in all departments. “Defensively. Bruno Fernandes, the speed upfront with [Dan] James, [Marcus] Rashford, [Anthony] Martial. “The experience of Cavani, a player I admire the most for what he’s done with his career. It’s Manchester United. “It’s a privilege to compete with them, to be in front of them. Tomorrow is no exception. It’s our target to do what we’ve done later,” Guardiola said.
