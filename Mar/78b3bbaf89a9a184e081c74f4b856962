Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has finally reacted after being dropped to the bench by manager, Mikel Arteta, during the Gunners’ Premier League derby 2-1 win against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Arsenal defeated Jose Mourinho’s side at Emirates, thanks to two goals from Martin Odegaard and Alexandre Lacazette as Erik Lamela’s strike was not enough for the visitors. Aubameyang had turned up late prior to the game, and the strict Arteta did not spare him any leniency, saying: “He was not going to start the game. “We had a disciplinary issue, we have drawn the line, and we move on. “We have a process that we have to respect for every game, and that’s it. “It was a decision made after evaluating everything and who Auba is and what he’s done. “We have other players who can play.” Reacting, Aubameyang, in a post via his Instagram account, was full of praises for his teammates after the match. In a post depicting his teammates celebrating, the Gabonese striker said: “North London is Red and that’s it!!!” Aubameyang will now hope to feature for Arsenal when they face Olympiacos in the Europa League on Thursday.
