Gunmen who abducted 39 students from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation in Afaka, Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State have released a video showing the abductees being flogged. Parents of the students have slso confirmed that the abductors have reached out and are demanding the sum of N500 million as ransom. The video shows the students in what appeared to be a forest. Governor Nasir El-Rufai has, however, ruled out the possibility of paying ransom or negotiating with the bandits when he appeared on Channels Television on Saturday. The abductors used the students Facebook accounts to release three videos showing them surrounded by gunmen in military uniform. Some of the students earlier rescued from the college confirmed the identities of their friends and schoolmates in the videos. The second and third videos were posted through the Facebook page of one of the students, Tasha Sandra. In one of the videos, most of the female students have only wrappers tied around their chest while majority of the male students were shirtless. In the second video posted around 11:30 am on Saturday, the gunmen were seen flogging the students while they screamed and appealed to the government to come to their rescue. Caption on the video posted on Tasha Sandra’s Face Book account, reads, “Please this is not a fake video or message please help us and pay the ransom the are asking for and do not try to send any armed forces to rescue us because the said the will kill us all. “Please I am calling on the federal government and state government to come up with the ransom 500 million naira.” See video   A post shared by nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen)
