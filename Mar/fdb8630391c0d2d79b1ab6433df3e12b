The Adamawa State Government has received 59,280 doses of the Aztrazeneca coronavirus vaccine from the Federal Government. Secretary to the State Government, Mallam Bashir Ahmad, confirmed the development to newsmen in his office Wednesday evening, saying both the vaccine viles and equal number of syringes have been kept away in prescribed manners. He disclosed that administration of the vaccines will begin on Monday, March 15, with a health worker and then the state governor. The SSG, who is also the Chairman of the state COVID-19 Containment Committee, said the state has created a portal for residents who are interested in taking the vaccine to register in preparation for their vaccination. He explained that the 59,280 vaccine doses are for people earmarked for the first phase of vaccination. People in the first phase, he pointed out, are those identified as frontline workers who include health workers and security personnel, as well as “critical leaders.” According to him, people with underlying illnesses that are regarded as vehicles on which the virus rides, such as the diabetic and asthma patients of all ages, will constitute residents of Adamawa State for the second phase of vaccination. Members of the general public, the SSG and Chairman of the state COVID-19 Containment Committee explained, would be administered vaccine in the third phase.
