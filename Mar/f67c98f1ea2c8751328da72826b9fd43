Manchester United defender, Eric Bailly, is ‘angry’ with the club’s manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, ahead of the Red Devils’ FA Cup clash with Leicester City on Sunday, according to The UK Sun. Bailly was furious after Solskjaer snubbed him and featured Victor Lindelof to partner Harry Maguire during Man United’s Europa League 1-0 victory against AC Milan at San Siro last Thursday. The Ivory Coast international is now set to reject an additional 12-month contract offer which would see him remain at Old Trafford until 2023. Bailly has largely played second fiddle to Lindelof as Maguire’s centre-back partner and has become more and more annoyed at his lack of opportunities under Solskjaer, with the Milan snub the final straw. He was also dropped after Man United’s disastrous 6-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur last October and has played just nine matches for Solskjaer’s side since then. “Eric has had enough now. He simply doesn’t feel wanted or respected by the manager,” The newspaper quoted a dressing-room source as saying. “Eric doesn’t believe he gets any answers or explanation about the way he is treated and feels he is the easy option to leave out. “It’s a real shame because Eric always tells us he loves the club and feels the respect of the fans.” Bailly joined Man United in 2016 from Villarreal. The 26-year-old has seen his time at Man United disrupted by injuries, with knee and ankle issues hampering his progress.
