Zamfara State Governor, Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle has declared that he has no hand in banditry activities in the State. He also challenged traditional rulers and political appointees to prove their innocence. The Governor said this while receiving an award as the Khadimul Qur’an conferred on him by the center for Qur’anic Reciter, Nigeria, in Gusau, the State capital. Governor Matawalle also challenged the traditional rulers and all citizens of the State to swear with the Holy Quran which he said would vindicate them that they have no involvement in the terror attacks ravaging the State. “I challenge the high and low in the State, as well as my political appointees, to take an oath with the Holy Quran, that they are not connected with banditry in the State,” he said. According to him, doing so will enable the citizens to know those behind the banditry activities, saying that such would ensure peace and tranquility in the State. Governor Mohammed described insecurity as worrisome, despite efforts to tackle it. He said as the Chief Security Officer of Zamfara State, he would do everything possible to provide a secured and peaceful environment for the residents, to go about carrying out their lawful businesses, without fear of anyone harming them. He said there was the need for all and sundry to come together to confront their common enemies, stressing that the fight against banditry and other forms of criminalities was a collective responsibility, and not a one man show.
