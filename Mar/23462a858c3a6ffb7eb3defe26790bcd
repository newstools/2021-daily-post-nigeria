Taiwo Adisa, Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde, said the All Progressives Congress (APC) was making moves to get the Oyo helmsman to leave the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Adisa, in a statement, noted that the “plot to lure Makinde to the APC” did not come as a surprise. According to him, the opposition was scared of a woeful performance in Oyo in the 2023 governorship election. The spokesman said the governor’s “unprecedented achievements” have surpassed the opposition’s imagination. “Rather than claim that Makinde wants to defect, the truth the APC elements should tell the world is that their party is attempting to lure the performing governor.” The CPS added that Makinde has not bothered to respond to their criticisms because he was focused on service delivery to the people. On the farmers/herders’ crisis, Adisa said the governor had remained on the side of the law and always insisted that criminals must be fished out without ethnic profiling
