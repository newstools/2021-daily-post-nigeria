The Zamfara State government has relaxed the dusk to dawn curfew imposed on Jangebe town and other nearby communities. It said business activities had fully resumed in the affected areas. This was disclosed by the Commissioner of Information, Hon. Ibrahim Magaji Dosara in a statement in Gusau, the State capital, Monday. He said the decision was taken following relative peace in the area. “However, Jangebe Market will remain closed until the state government is satisfied with the security situation of the area”, he said. DAILY POST recalls that 279 school girls were abducted in their dormitory from Government Girls’ Secondary School Jangere, last month, which caused serious tension in the area.
