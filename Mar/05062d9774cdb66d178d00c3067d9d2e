Everton boss, Carlo Ancelotti, has compared Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea to the Frank Lampard era ahead of both sides clash in the Premier League on Monday night at Stamford Bridge. Ancelotti said Tuchel has the quality, while Lampard did a fantastic job during his time at the Blues. Tuchel has not lost a match in his last ten games as Chelsea manager since he replaced Lampard last January. “Offensively, they [Chelsea] play a little bit different but not too much because the quality of the players is still the same,” Ancelotti said as quoted by football365. “Now they are really consistent because they haven’t lost under Tuchel, and they are solid, but this doesn’t mean Lampard didn’t do a good job. I think Lampard did a fantastic job while he was there. “(Tuchel) has quality. He is a young manager, but he already has experience in Germany, and in Paris, so he is a manager with knowledge and ambition.” Everton defeated Chelsea 1-0 last December at Goodison Park in the reverse fixture.
