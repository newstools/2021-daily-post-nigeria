Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has reacted to the release of Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) members Police arrested over Iskili Wakili. Dauda Kazeem, Awodele Adedigba and Ramon Hassan were part of the OPC team that apprehended the alleged ethnic warlord on Sunday. After the capture at the Kajola area of Ibarapa North Local Government in Oyo State, the Police arrested them for alleged murder of an unidentified civilian. The action was widely condemned. Adams, in his reaction, lambasted the Police for treating the OPC members like criminals, after helping them to nab Wakili. Speaking on Tuesday, Adams, the OPC National Leader, described their freedom as good news. “I thank all that raised their voices against the unjust detention, including well meaning Nigerians, public opinion experts, socio-cultural groups, such as Afenifere, Yoruba Summit Group (YSG) and the media. “I want to assure Nigerians that the OPC will continue to support and complement the efforts of all security agencies, including the police in ensuring that the south west is safe”, Adams added. Wakili and his gang have been accused of crimes including murder, rape and kidnapping. In late February, the OPC fished out his boys, including Isiaka Muhammadu. He is regarded as Wakili’s second in command.
