Former Zamfara State Governor, Abdul’aziz Yari, has reacted to news of him alleging that members of the All Progressives Congress, APC, sponsor banditry. Yari insisted that he never accused the party members of sponsoring banditry while in office, NAN reports. He stated this while addressing journalists in the Talata Marafa Local Government Area of the state, on Monday. The former governor described those behind the allegations as mischief-makers. According to Yari, the mischief-makers are those determined to work against the APC. Yari said: “When I was the governor, I never accused the opposition party of sponsoring banditry. “I wish to debunk such claims as they were made by mischief makers working against APC in the state.” Zamfara State is one of the states that has witnessed the sting of banditry. Bandits had abducted several students from the state and later freed them, following intervention from the state government.
