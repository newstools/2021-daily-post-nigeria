Former Governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole, has made peace with the incumbent, Godwin Obaseki, describing him as his brother and friend. Both men met in Auchi, Edo State, at the Centenary Birthday Thanksgiving of Msgr. Thomas Oleghe and 18th Canonical Erection Anniversary of the Diocese of Auchi. Oshiomhole and Obaseki exchanged greetings with an elbow-bump in compliance with COVID-19 protocols. Obaseki said, “I don’t have anything personal against Oshiomhole. I may not like his politic but he has not done anything personal against me. We all are interacting with the interest of the country and the development of our community at heart.” On his part, Oshiomhole, who was a guest at the event, hailed his successor, describing him as “his brother and friend”. Oshiomhole said, “Once the governor speaks, the matter ends. The governor knows that pensioners here might not be able to do much, that is why he said every other thing required to complete the hostel of the Catholic School of Nursing and Midwifery in Uzairue, his government will do.”
