Real Madrid is ready to sell defender, Raphael Varane to Manchester United this summer on one condition, AS reports. Varane has drawn the interest of Man United in the past. The France international currently has less than 18 months in his contract with Real Madrid. The former Lens star is believed to be keen to experience life away from Santiago Bernabeu. Varane must first inform Real Madrid of his decision to leave the club before the La Liga champions open negotiations with Man United for the centre-back. Real Madrid is keen to keep Varane but they will not allow the player to enter the last season of his contract without extending his deal. Zinedine Zidane’s side are presently under huge financial pressure and they can’t afford to lose Varane cheaply in 2022, so they have decided to cash in this summer if the 27-year-old makes it clear that he will not sign a new deal with the Los Blancos at the end of the season. Varane must inform the Real Madrid board of his decision before the transfer window opens so the club can prepare for negotiations with Man United.
