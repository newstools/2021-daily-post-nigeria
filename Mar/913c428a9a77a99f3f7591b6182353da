The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has certified AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine safe for use in Nigeria. Dr Osagie Ehanire, the Minister of Health, made this known on Friday at an event held at the National Hospital in Abuja. Ehanire explained that the government agency cleared the vaccine for use in Nigeria after NAFDAC concluded its final test on it. Ehanire said, “The long-awaited day is here on which Nigerians can now join others in the global community to be vaccinated against the dreaded COVID-19 virus. “For us in the health sector, it is a relief and the marking of the start of a tedious but hopeful exercise to see our fellow citizens develop immunity against this virus.” He added, “I am also relieved again to announce that at 12 minutes past midnight today (Friday), I got a text message informing me that NAFDAC has certified this vaccine for use, otherwise, we will not be sitting here today.” Recall that Nigeria, on Tuesday, received 3.94 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and shipped via the COVAX facility.
