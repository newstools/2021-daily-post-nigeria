The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has confirmed that 16 teams have qualified for the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations. This means they are eight slots up for grabs. “The Elephants are heading to Cameroon! “Côte d’Ivoire are the 16th team to qualify to the 2021 #TotalAFCON. 8 spots to go,” CAF tweeted on Friday. Before Friday, Comoros, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Egypt, Algeria, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, Senegal, Tunisia and hosts Cameroon has booked their places in January’s tournament. Three-time champions Nigeria will be seeking to claim one of the remaining slots, when they take on Benin Republic on Saturday. Gernot Rohr’s men only need a point to secure a ticket to AFCON 2022.
