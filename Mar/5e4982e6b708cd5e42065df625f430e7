Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has predicted that Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, will take home the Ballon d’Or prize at least once within the next five years. He also believes Mbappe will be playing for Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain. The 22-year-old’s contract with PSG expires at the end of next season and top European clubs are monitoring his situation. PSG may be forced to cash in if they cannot get him to commit to a new deal. Wenger thinks he will remain in Ligue 1 or move to Madrid. “In five years’ time, Kylian will be on top of the world. On top of the world in Paris or Madrid,” Wenger told Le Parisien. “And I hope he will have won one or several Ballon d’Or. Kylian must not place any limitations on himself.”
