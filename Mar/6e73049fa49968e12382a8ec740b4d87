A human rights activist, Adeniyi Sulaiman, has hailed the directive by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to bankers to declare their assets. Sulaiman accused some financial institutions and their officials of aiding the fraudulent activities that made several Nigerians lose their hard earned money. The Chairman, Centre for Human Rights and Social Justice (CHRSJ) said bankers and unions should not be afraid of EFCC if they had nothing to hide. Sulaiman maintained that the staff including Tellers, Marketers and Managers were perpetrating fraud in the industry. “Abdulrasheed Bawa, the EFCC Chairman, touched the wounds of the bankers by requesting their Assets Declaration form June, 2021. “They are not comfortable with the new policy because some of their hands have soiled with fraud”, the activist said. The CHRSJ recalled that it dragged the banks before the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the EFCC over alarming infractions against their customers. The group warned if the scams committed by bankers are not probed, it would launch “#EndBankingFraud” nationwide protest.
