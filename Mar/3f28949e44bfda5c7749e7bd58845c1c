Over 100 cows were over the weekend “arrested” by the men of the Ondo State Security Agency, otherwise known as Amotekun Corps for flouting the open grazing laws of the State. The herders, who were suspected not to have registered with the State government, took to their heels upon sighting the operatives of the Amotekun Corps. DAILY POST gathered that the cows were caught grazing along the busy Akure/Ilesa highway. Disclosing this, the Commander of the Corps in the State, Adetunji Adeleye stated that the move was part of efforts at curbing crimes in the State and as well enforcing the directives of the State government that the streets and forest reserves be rid of unregistered herdsmen.  According to Adeleye, the cows were intercepted and arrested at the boundary of Osun and Ondo State, adding that it took his men about 30 kilometres walk to control the cows to the corps headquarters in Akure, the State capital. “I don’t want to narrow it on the issue of capturing cattle. I would want to say it’s a way of reducing crime. These cows were actually blocking the major road leading to the State capital,” he said. The Corps Commander also emphasized that with the herders engaging in illegal grazing, kidnappers use it as a ploy to waylay victims. “One of the occupants in the vehicle that was blocked called our distress line. And within few minutes, our men were on ground. “We should take note that our men are in all the 18 local government areas and we are on 24 hours patrol. We arrived the scene promptly. “The culprits who sited us on arrival ran away as they controlled the cows to follow them, but we were only able to control them back,” he said.
