The Convener of Stand Up For Women Society, NGO, Barr Deborah Oladele has berated the current situation of the country, noting that Nigeria could be better if women are given chances at the stage of policy formulation. She noted this during the inauguration of the Non-Governmental Organisation in Abuja. Barr Oladele charged women to focus on self-development and the development of the country as well. She regretted how women were being sidelined in policy formulation issues and counselled them to seek offices to make a difference for their gender. She said, “70 percent of farmers in the rural area are women and they are not given loans or grants. Women don’t get a loan because they don’t have access to collateral.” Speaking on some of the issues affecting women, the convener condemned underage marriage, lamenting that women bear the brunt of traumatic issues arising from it. “Nigeria could have been a better country if women are given more space in politics. Women are not dullards, women are not fighting men, they can also develop themselves in many areas,” she said.
