Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe has reacted to the Peoples Democratic Party’s victory in Saturday’s by-election in Aba North/South Federal Constituency. He said that PDP’s Chimaobi Ebisike’s victory was due to a clean campaign by the party while thanking the people of Aba for trooping out to elect a representative of their choice. In a statement by his Media Adviser, Uchenna Awom, the lawmaker noted that the Party understood the challenge and mobilised voters as never before, which culminated in a victory. The statement pointed out that PDP’s performance in Abia State was an added factor that drove victory for it, too, while he accused the All Progressives Congress-led government of treating Ndigbo with disdain. “This victory is soothing and a clear signal that our people are very conscious of what is going on in the country, with the shoddy treatment of the Ndigbo by the APC government. Never again can we be led by the nose, by people who don’t mean well for our people”, Abaribe said. Nonetheless, he advised the party to be magnanimous in victory and remain united and eschew tendencies that could alienate those willing to join now.
