Motorists, pedestrians as well as residents along Fadilullah junction, Oke-Ayepe have complained about a faulty heavy-duty truck causing obstruction to the smooth flow of vehicular movement along the Oke-Ayepe road in Osogbo since Friday, 12th March, 2021. They complained that despite repeated appeals to the appropriate government agencies, nothing has been done as the truck remains stuck in the middle of the road and blocking traffic. A teacher at Saint Charles Grammar School, Oke-Ayepe who prefer not to be in print revealed to DAILY POST that the situation has been pathetic since it happened because the road from time has been narrow. He explained that it was because of the narrow nature of the road that the last administration in the state had to embark on its rehabilitation which has also been abandoned for years. He lamented that the breakdown of the heavy duty vehicle in the middle of the road is something of a nightmare because it has worsened the traffic situation. Korope drivers and commercial motorcyclists coming from either way, DAILY POST observed had to create an alternative route near the stuck truck to avoid head on collision as a result of visual obstruction. Attempts to get Engr. Olatoke Olaniyan, the Special Adviser on Transport to the state government to comment on the matter proved abortive. Meanwhile, in a response to a text message sent to Mrs. Kudirat Ibarahim, the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) Osun Sector Commander, she acknowledged the receipt of the same information Tuesday evening at about 7:15 pm. She disclosed that the obstruction has been assessed and FRSC personnel will be there Wednesday morning to clear the obstruction. She appreciated the public for their active response and feedback on road safety matters in the state.
