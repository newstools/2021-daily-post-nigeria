The Presidency has declared that nobody can bring down the current Federal Government. President Muhammadu Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, made he remark on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily, on Friday. Shehu assured Nigerians that Buhari was working towards addressing the several challenges facing the country. According to Shehu: “Nobody can bring down the government because this is a government elected democratically. “I want to assure Nigerians that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is addressing multiple challenges that are facing the country especially in dealing with security and yet we are still making progress in agriculture, economy, anti-corruption, which are the key policies that brought the party and the government to office.” The presidential spokesman also lamented that those in opposition are exploiting the challenges facing the country. “It is sad for the country that opposition is exploiting some of these things. It is quite unfortunate and I want to assure that the president remains focused in preserving the security and unity of this country,” he added.
