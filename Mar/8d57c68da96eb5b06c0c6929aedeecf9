Everton coach, Carlo Ancelotti, has warned Chelsea that his team can now compete with Thomas Tuchel’s side for a place in the Premier League top four. Ancelotti gave the warning during his pre-match press conference ahead of Everton’s Premier League clash with Chelsea on Monday night at Stamford Bridge. The Italian gaffer believes Everton are now better, having defeated Chelsea 1-0 last December at Goodison Park in the reverse fixture when Frank Lampard was in charge of the Blues. Ancelotti’s side head to the game following a 1-0 victory over West Brom last Thursday, while Chelsea defeated Liverpool 1-0 “I think we are better. We have more knowledge and more belief in what we’re doing,” Ancelotti said. “We can compete against Chelsea [for EPL top four]. It will be difficult, we know because they are a fantastic team, but we can compete.” He added: Of course. “We have twelve tests until the end of the season. “This against Chelsea is the first one, but there are a lot of teams involved. A lot of strong teams.” The kick-off time for the game is 4: 15 pm, Nigerian time.
