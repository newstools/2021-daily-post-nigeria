Chelsea winger, Christian Pulisic, has offered the latest update on his fitness level ahead of his side’s Premier League against West Brom on April 3 at Stamford Bridge. Pulisic said he is ‘feeling good’ and ‘excited’ for what is to come ahead of the West Brom clash. “It always feels good, of course, to get on the scoresheet. It’s definitely going to help build some confidence,” the 22-year-old told reporters at a post-match press conference after USA’s 2-1 win over Northern Ireland in an international friendly match on Sunday. “I am feeling good, the guys are feeling good as it seemed here. For me personally as well, going back to the club level, I’m excited. “I am feeling confident, as I have said. I feel the best I have felt in my game, so I am excited for what’s to come.” He added: “I was definitely playing my game. Obviously, positionally things changed a bit from a formation standpoint, but when I get the ball, I still have the same objectives in mind. “I am still going right at the goal and trying to create things, and I was able to do that today.”
