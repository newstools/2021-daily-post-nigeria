FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, has expressed his optimism that the president of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, will make a meaningful contribution to the development of football after his election as a member of the FIFA Council. Pinnick won the highly-coveted seat, defeating Malawian FA president, Walter Nyamilandu during the 43rd CAF General Assembly in Rabat. The 50-year-old becomes the third Nigerian to achieve the feat after Oyo Orok Oyo and Amos Adamu. Pinnick will be representing Africa in the highest decision-making organisation of the world football governing body, along with Egypt’s Hany Abou Rida, Morocco’s Fouzi Lekjaa, Mali’s Mamoutou Toure, Benin’s Mathurin De Chacus and Sierra Leone’s Aisha Johansen. “I would like herewith reiterate my warmest congratulations to you for your election as member of the Fifa Council, at the 43 CAF Ordinary and Elective General Assembly, held on Friday in Rabat,” Infantino said. “I have no doubt that your experience, your knowledge, not to mention your passion, your sense of consensus and your personal qualities, will help you to meet future challenges at the service of the world football community. “I am convinced that, as Fifa Council Member, you will make an important contribution to Fifa and, most importantly, to the development of our sport, which unites us all. “Sending you my best wishes of luck, courage and success for all the challenges that lie ahead, I look forward, dear Pinnick, to working with you already at the next meeting of the Fifa Council, which will be held by videoconference this Friday, 19 March.”
