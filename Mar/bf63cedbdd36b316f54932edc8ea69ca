The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has explained why his wife, Oluremi, was absent at the 12th colloquium to celebrate his 69th birthday in Kano State. According to Tinubu, she was dealing with guests at his Bourdillon residence in Lagos State. Oluremi is currently a senator representing Lagos Central Senatorial District at the Nigerian National Assembly. Tinubu said, “My wife is dealing with the crowd now in Bourdillon and she is probably not even watching (online) but without her permission. “I couldn’t be here, without her collaboration, I won’t have peace to be standing here before you. Very gracious woman.” The colloquium held in Kano, was themed, ‘Our Common Bond, Our Common Wealth: The Imperative Of National Cohesion For Growth And Prosperity’. The event was virtually attended by President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice-President, Yemi Osinbajo; House of Representatives Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila; Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; amongst others.
