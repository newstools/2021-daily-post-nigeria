Olumide and Stephanie Aderinokun Foundation has taken giant steps in providing water facilities to communities in Abeokuta South and Abeokuta North Local Government Areas in Ogun State. It was two days of jubilation across the two local government areas as residents were grateful for the Foundation’s humanitarian service. On Thursday, the first borehole project was commissioned at Arinlese Road beside Alhaji Sanusi House, Isaje, Abeokuta South by former governorship candidate, Honourable Ladi Adebutu.  The following day, the commissioning train berth in Abeokuta North with Hon. Adebutu was also in attendance to open two fetching points built in Owu and Lafenwa Market. In complementing the projects donated by Olumide and Stephanie Aderinokun, Hon. Adebutu – who is also the Omogbadero of Owu Kingdom – said he will be providing replacement transformers to the faulty ones in the area where boreholes were commissioned. “My brother has brought water and I have decided to give the community a replacement transformer. You’ll decide where you want to put it,” he said. “Anywhere there is a faulty transformer in this community, do findings immediately and let David know so that I can release a replacement. “Where we come from, it is not for campaign today and you may think we have come to talk about PDP, which is not so because we are PDP members. When it is time, we will campaign and you will know PDP is a gracious party.”  In November 2020, Chief David Olumide Aderinokun, a foremost businessman – who ran for Abeokuta North Federal Constituency seat in the 2019 general elections – disclosed his ambition to join the Ogun Central Senate race under the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) come 2023. Stephanie Aderinokun, his wife, is a media personality – formerly a presenter for MTV Base Africa and Ebony Life TV.
