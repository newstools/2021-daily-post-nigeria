The Defence Headquarters says the Nigerian military cannot stoop low to spy on an individual as claimed by Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho. The Acting Director, Defence Media Operations, Brig.-Gen. Benard Onyeuko, reacted to the news in a statement on Saturday. In a viral video, two men in military uniform and two others were interviewed for allegedly surveying Igboho’s Soka residence in Ibadan. Igboho, real name Sunday Adeyemo, linked the alleged spy to the federal government and his declaration that the Yoruba are no longer a part of Nigeria. Onyeuko said the Armed Forces are professional in the discharge of their duties, with well-defined roles and duties in its mandate of securing the territorial integrity of Nigeria. “The Military cannot stoop so low to such extent to ‘spy’ on one individual. It is practically impossible for military personnel on official duty to conduct themselves in such a manner as alleged by Adeyemo and his cohorts,” he said. Onyeuko noted that a preliminary investigation revealed that one of the alleged “soldiers” was a serial impersonator. The spokesman said eyewitnesses and sources disclosed Igbhoho’s associates went after some individuals when the motorbike conveying the impersonator and one Nigerian Air Force (NAF) personnel ran into them. Onyeuko confirmed a full probe was underway by NAF and the Nigerian Army to unravel the actual circumstances which played out. The Defence Headquarters warned individuals and groups to desist from disparaging the reputation of the Nigerian military.
