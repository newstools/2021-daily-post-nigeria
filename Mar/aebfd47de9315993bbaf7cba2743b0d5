Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has expressed an interest in coaching Paris Saint-Germain in future. Arteta sent one year on loan at PSG between 2001 and 2002. During his spell in France, he won the Intertoto Cup before leaving Barcelona for Rangers. His history with the Ligue 1 club has led to links with a possible return. Arteta was in December mentioned as a potential candidate when Thomas Tuchel was sacked, before Mauricio Pochettino was appointed. “I love Paris, I love Paris,” Arteta told BeIN Sports FR. “I have very good memories from over there. It was my first club as a professional. The club is always in my heart. “You never know, but I have a lot of work to do (at Arsenal).”
