The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) will carry out another COVID-19 test for Everton forward, Alex Iwobi. Iwobi tested positive on arrival at Porto Novo ahead of Saturday’s 1-0 win over Benin Republic in a 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. He immediately left camp and returned to Lagos to self-isolate. Iwobi would, however, undergo another test, to confirm if it was just a ploy by the Beninoise to demoralise the Super Eagles. If he tests negative, the former Arsenal man will be part of the Lesotho game on Tuesday. Gernot Rohr’s men have already qualified for next year’s tournament.
