Suspected hoodlums in early hours of Monday invaded and burnt down a divisional police station in Essien Udim Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State The incident occurred barely one week after some hoodlums in the same local government attacked members of the Quick Response Squad at Ikpe Annang’ junction and burnt an inspector of police inside a police van. It was gathered that the hoodlums came out in their numbers burnt offices including unserviceable vehicles and motorcycles but no life was lost. However, the Chairman of Essien Udim Local Government Council, Mr Anthony Luke, has condemned the attack on the police station, describing it as an act of cowardice. “The council will not be intimidated in the war against criminality in the area,” Luke said. While calling on Essien Udim people to remain calm and go about their legitimate businesses, the council chairman assured them that the council was working assiduously in collaboration with the state government and security agencies to bring the perpetrators to justice soon. Meanwhile, the Police Public Relations Officer, SP Odiko Macdon, has confirmed the incident, saying investigation is still ongoing to unravel the perpetrators. He said the state Commissioner of Police, Andrew Amiengheme, had visited the station for an on-the-spot assessment “I can confirm that our station was torched by the hoodlums. The CP has visited the station for an on-the-spot assessment. Investigation is still ongoing, no life was lost and no rifle carted away,” Macdon said.
