The Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, CDHR, has said that Nigeria is undergoing a high level of human rights infringement on so many fronts particularly with the high level of insecurity in the country coupled with the unprecedented killings of farmers by the militia Fulani herdsmen and the incessant kidnapping of students, particularly the Friday’s abduction of over 300 schoolgirls in Zamfara State by bandits. CDHR’s Acting National President, Comr. Dr Prince Kehinde Taiga in a statement made available to DAILY POST after it rose from its
National Council meeting held in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State said the activities of herders and bandits in the country today show that the security of farmers and students respectively are no longer guaranteed. The CDHR urged the federal government to declare a state of emergency on security in the country in order to put an end to these happenings. According to the CDHR, “The experiences of kidnapping from Chibok, Dapchi, Kagara and Jangebe for ransom by bandits is more than enough reason for the federal government to declare these bandits as terrorists. “Today, in the northern part of our nation, we currently face multi-dimensional security challenges and continuous threats to the safety and security of our schools and this is an infringement on the rights of our students to association and learning. “Furthermore, we must at this juncture change our security approach in the country. “As we cannot keep doing the same thing over and over again and expect different results. The change of service chiefs by the President hasn’t yielded any result worthy of note, and that’s why we are saying that there is need for us to change our approach today.”
