Liverpool owners, Fenway Sports Group, have chosen to back manager Jurgen Klopp, despite their dreadful dip in form. Klopp’s future at Anfield has become a topic of debate in recent weeks, as the Premier League champions have slithered out of the title race. Their 1-0 defeat to Fulham last week, means they have set a club record of six consecutive league home defeats at Anfield. This had led to uncertainty over whether they will qualify for the Champions League. FSG have historically seen Champions League qualification as the minimum requirement for a manager during the 10 years they have been in control. A failure to finish in the top four cost Kenny Dalglish his job in 2012, while Brendan Rodgers never recovered from missing out in 2015. The Americans however have complete faith in Klopp, who also enjoys the backing of the majority of supporters. The German’s relationship with Mike Gordon, FSG’s President who oversees the day-to-day running of Liverpool, is also very strong.
