Inter Milan striker, Romelu Lukaku will only accept interest from Chelsea, Barcelona, Manchester City and Real Madrid if the club’s manager, Antonio Conte, departs the Nerazzurri, according to the Daily Mail. Inter Milan have rejected all interest in Lukaku, who is understood to be keen to stay at the San Siro, providing Conte remains in charge of Serie A leaders with the pair sharing a strong relationship. Lukaku has enjoyed the best football of his career under the guidance of Conte and has formed a fine partnership with Lautaro Martinez for Inter. The former Chelsea and Manchester United star has been impressive since signing for Inter from Manchester United in 2019 in a £73m deal. The Belgium international has become the fastest player in Inter’s history to reach 50 goals in all competitions. The 27-year-old has scored 19 league goals and registered eight assists in just 26 appearances so far this season for Conte’s side. His performances have attracted transfer interest from top clubs in England and Spain.
