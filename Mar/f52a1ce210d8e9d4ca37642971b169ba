Former Liverpool player, Mark Lawrenson, has predicted Manchester City to beat Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday evening. Lawrenson also predicted Chelsea to defeat Everton on Monday night at Stamford Bridge. Providing his predictions, Lawrenson told BBC Sport, “Both these sides are right in the mix for the top four, and this is a tough one to call. “Chelsea still haven’t conceded a home goal in four games under Thomas Tuchel, and Everton are better on the road than they are at Goodison Park – the Toffees haven’t lost an away game since 1 November, and 29 of their 46 points have come on the road. “I’m going to go with a Chelsea win here, although it would not surprise me if Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti ends up getting something to show for his return to Stamford Bridge.” Commenting on the Man City vs Man United game, Lawrenson said, “United must know by now that they are not going to stop City winning the league. “I remember in April 2018 when City led 2-0 in this game at half-time and were about to clinch the title, but United came back to win 3-2. “That only delayed the inevitable, though. City were crowned champions a few days later. “It’s similar with this game. United have been struggling to score of late – they have drawn a blank in their past three games in all competitions – but if they do get something out of it, it will be more important for their top-four hopes than for catching City at the top.” The kick-off time for Chelsea vs Everton is 7 pm, while that of Man City vs Man United is 5:30 pm.
