Jurgen Klopp has said that he is not thinking about finishing in the Premier League top four at the moment. Liverpool are finding life difficult with series of poor results coming from both home and away games. The Reds were overpowered by bottom three side, Fulham, losing 1-0 at Anfield to Scott Parker’s side on Sunday. The Reds have now lost 6 matches consecutively and every hope of making it to next season’s Champions League is fading away. Addressing the press after the match, the German gaffer, who is now under intense pressure, said, “I imagine that is really not my concern in the moment. I understand that you have to ask that but I cannot think about that. “We have to win football games, we have to win one football game, that would be helpful already and then we will see [with] the rest,” Klopp said when asked where the result leaves Liverpool’s hopes of a top-four finish
