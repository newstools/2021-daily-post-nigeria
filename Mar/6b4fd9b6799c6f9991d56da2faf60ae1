Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has explained why he benched Bruno Fernandes in his side’s FA Cup 3-1 defeat against Leicester City on Sunday. Solskjaer said he benched Fernandes against Leicester because the midfielder is ‘not inhuman’ amid the hectic fixture schedule so far. Kelechi Iheanacho’s brace and a strike from Youri Tielemans ensured Leicester knocked out Man United from the FA Cup at the King Power Stadium. Explaining his decision to bench Fernandes, Solskjaer said in his post-match press conference, “Every team selection has reasons behind it. “Bruno has played very, very much football. He broke all his records on Thursday night [at the San Siro] physically statistically, and the boy is not inhuman. “He’s also a human being. He’s played a game every three or four days, really. It was a chance to start with both Donny [van de Beek] and Paul [Pogba]. “The accumulation of games may be caught up with us. I know Bruno wants to play, but sometimes you make decisions for the benefit of both the team and him.”
