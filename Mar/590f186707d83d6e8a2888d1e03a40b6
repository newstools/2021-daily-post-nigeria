Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has confirmed that David De Gea will be given an extended break, following the birth of his first child. De Gea flew back to Spain to be with his girlfriend for the birth of Yanay. Dean Henderson, who came in for the 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace, will be in goal for Sunday’s Manchester derby and may keep the position until the international break. “We will give him the time he needs, he has to go home and, in the old world, you go back a day, come back, but with the quarantine, it’s a different world. “When David said he wanted to go and be there to support his girlfriend, it’s not even a decision to make. Dean came in and played well, and he’s ready. I’ll give David the time he needs. “As soon as David travels back, we just have to follow the Government rules, I expect him to be available very soon. “We want our players back as soon as possible, but there’s a human being in there and David was there for this fantastic day for him and his girlfriend. “I don’t know when he’ll be back, but it won’t be long before he comes back. It was easy when I travelled back from the Euros, my son Noah was born on a Friday, we played Spain on Tuesday, travelled back Sunday. “But this is the biggest occasion in any parents’ lives. Dean did well against Palace and is looking forward to this City game as well,” Solskjaer told reporters on Friday.
