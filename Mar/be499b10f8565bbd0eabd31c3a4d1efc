The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has said he will only support former President Goodluck Jonathan if he accepts the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential ticket for the 2023 election. Wike insisted he would snub the former President if he opts to contest under the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He stated this while speaking to BBC Pidgin at the weekend in Port Harcourt. Governor Wike explained that even Jonathan understands that he would work against his ambition if Jonathan joins the APC and clinches the party’s ticket to run for President in 2023. He said: “I am a PDP member, if former President Goodluck Jonathan picks a ticket to run in my party, I will support him. I can’t do anti-party. But if he picks a ticket to run in APC, I won’t support him because I can’t do anti-party. “He knows I won’t support him in APC even if he is from the south. I don’t do that kind of politics. It is the party we are talking about and I don’t play ethnicity.” However, the former President has remained coy over his intentions to contest for president in 2023, despite widespread insinuations that he may contest in 2023.
