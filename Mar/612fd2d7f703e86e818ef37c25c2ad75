AC Milan striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, is set to face his former club Manchester United in the Europa League, after he returned to training on Tuesday. Ibrahimovic missed the first leg of the last-16 tie at Old Trafford due to injury. In his absence, the Rossoneri drew 1-1 with the Red Devils. Ibrahimovic suffered a thigh muscle tear during their 2-1 win at Roma in Serie A on February 28. The 39-year-old then missed subsequent Serie A games against Udinese and Verona. He was also unavailable for Milanâ€™s 2-1 loss to Napoli at the weekend, but is now back to light training. Ibrahimovic has since taken part in a full session with the first team, and Stefano Pioli will now have to decide whether or not to start him against the Red Devils on Thursday.
