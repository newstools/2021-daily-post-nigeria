The Federal Government of Nigeria has jammed Radio Biafra in Lagos. The National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) made the announcement Monday night. NBC said it intercepted the signals, which were transmitted to most part of the nation’s commercial hub. “The illegal Radio, which broadcasts incendiary messages, is notorious for spewing fake, inflammatory and inciting content”, a statement read. NBC said the Department of State Services (DSS) and Nigeria Police have been requested to bring the culprits to book.
