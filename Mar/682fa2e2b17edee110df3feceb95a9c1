Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola has addressed talk of a fight between him and England forward, Raheem Sterling. He insisted that it is normal for football players to be unhappy when they are left out in the team. The England winger was a surprise absentee from Guardiola’s matchday squad for the win over Fulham at the weekend. He was also an unused substitute for their 5-2 victory against Southampton three days earlier. Manchester City has travelled to Germany where they will face Borussia Monchengladbach in the Champions League on Tuesday, and Guardiola says there are no issues between him and the player. Asked if there were rifts between him and the former Liverpool man, Guardiola said, “He travels with the team. All the squad travels to Budapest for the Champions League. “Always Raheem and all the players react really well. “I do not expect they are happy, the guys who do not play and who are not selected, so it is normal. That has always happened since football was created. “Raheem in this case is so important for the team and for all of us. “All the players respect my decisions. “I never found in my career in 40 years one player who was happy when they are not playing, never, ever. But they react really well and behave very well.”
