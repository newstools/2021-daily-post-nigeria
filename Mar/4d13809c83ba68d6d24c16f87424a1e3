Chief Magnus Abe, a factional leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, has said that Igo Aguma, sacked Chairman of the state’s Caretaker Committee of the party, was an ally to the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi. According to Abe, Aguma was never in his camp as widely believed, adding that he (Aguma) was free to leave the party. The Supreme Court had last week affirmed the sacking of Aguma as the party’s chairman of the caretaker committee in the state. But speaking on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Monday, Abe also said that the apex court’s decision should afford the APC an opportunity to put its house in order. “Chief Igo Aguma as you would recall became chairman by virtue of a court judgement when he tried to intervene in a crisis. He was actually a member of the Minister’s faction,” he said. “He was not part of us originally so his leaving is a personal decision. Like everybody knows in this country, every adult is free to associate with whomever he wants to associate with. He took the decision of the court to mean that the party will not respond to the issues. “But we took the decision of the court to see it as a fresh opportunity for the All Progressives Congress (APC) to put its house in order.” Pained by the decision of the Supreme Court to sustain an earlier ruling of the Appeal Court, Aguma had announced he is no longer a member of the APC.
