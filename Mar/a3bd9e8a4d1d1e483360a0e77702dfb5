Chidi Izuwah, Director-General of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC), is dead. Izuwah, an Engineer and Management executive, rose to the position of DG in 2019. President Muhammadu Buhari, in a statement, Tuesday night, offered his condolences to the family and friends. The Nigerian leader hailed the late public servant who held several positions in the oil and gas sector before joining the public service in 2009. “Izuwah was reform oriented and highly skilled, playing very important roles in advancing infrastructure financing in Nigeria with special emphasis on Public-Private Partnerships (PPP). He will be missed,” he noted. Buhari said his thoughts and prayers are with the family, the government and people of Abia State as they mourn the demise of an illustrious son.
