Some unknown gunmen have reportedly kidnapped two female students of the Olabisi Onabanjo University. DAILY POST learned that the students were abducted on Sunday night at the schools’ Ayetoro campus in Yewa-North Local Government Area of Ogun State. The Ogun State Police Command has confirmed the incident. Recall that Yewa North has recorded cases of herdsmen clashes and kidnapping lately. Precious Adeyemo and Abiola Oyefule, who are students of the Departments of Forestry and Wildlife Management and Agricultural Economics respectively were picked up in front of their hostel in the Olowu area of the town. It was gathered that the abductors have contacted the families of the victims, demanding a ransom of N50 million for the release of their children. Our correspondent learnt that the kidnappers reached the parents of the victims through the students’ phones. “The bandits have gone on a manhunt for a female call card voucher bulk dealer and they were shooting sporadically into the air to gain access to the premises of the lady. When they discovered that the gate was closed and they could not enter the premises, they became wild. Unknown to the female students, who were returning to the same house of abode, they were taken away by the bandits. It was this morning that it became known that they were kidnapped,” another source explained. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST that the students were truly kidnapped. Oyeyemi said, “I can not confirm if the abductors are demanding ransom. But it is true that they were abducted. Right now, the area has been cordoned off. The anti-kidnapping unit, the Area Commander, the DPO are all on top of the situation.”
