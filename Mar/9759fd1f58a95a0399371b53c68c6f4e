The appointees of Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State have been barred from speaking to journalists or granting press interviews. In a statement made available to DAILY POST on Tuesday, the Special Adviser, Media and Publicity to the Governor, Christian Ita, said he has observed with disappointment that some persons have regrettably arrogated to themselves the role of the Chief Press Secretary. “I have observed with utter disappointment that some persons in the media unit have regrettably arrogated to themselves the role of the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor and have persistently been posturing as speaking for the governor. “The latest of such incident occurred yesterday when one of the appointees in the unit reportedly spoke on a delicate issue he had no authorization is a case in point. “While I am still battling to clear the mess occasioned by the brazen zealotry of the purported spokesperson, may I warn that on no account should an appointee in the Media unit posture, parade or pass himself/herself off as speaking for His Excellency, Governor Ben Ayade.” Ita said that as a reminder, the responsibility of speaking for His Excellency the Governor, remains the exclusive preserve of the Special Adviser on Media/Chief Press Secretary. He said any further circumvention of this warning shall be greeted with the severity of penalty it deserves, including redeployment from the unit, “For a coordinated flow of information and a strategic response to issues that border on the Governor’s image, ONLY the Chief Press Secretary/Special Adviser on Media and Publicity holds the gavel, unless as he so delegates,” he stated.
