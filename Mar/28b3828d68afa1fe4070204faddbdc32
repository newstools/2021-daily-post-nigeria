Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has told striker, Anthony Martial, how he can become the club’s main striker. Scholes said the France international could establish himself as the Red Devils’ first-choice centre forward and score 30 goals per season if he develops a “ruthless streak”. Martial was impressive in Man United’s 2-0 victory over Manchester City on Sunday as he won an early penalty during the encounter. “Today against Manchester City, I thought they were excellent on the counter-attack. I thought Martial was really good as he (Solskjaer) said in the interview,” Scholes told Premier League Productions. “He’s not scored today, he’s had a great opportunity to score, but the other things he did meant he was a real threat. He was working hard. “He has quality, I really like him. I think he’s suffered the last ten or so games with confidence more than anything. The lad has got real ability, he probably should’ve scored today when he had a great chance and the keeper saved. “When you go to Manchester City, that might be the only chance you get. Someone like Michael (Owen) they take it, they know. They understand, ‘I’ve got to be ready if I get that chance, I’ll put it away. “I don’t think he’s got that streak in him. But if he does get that streak in him, he’s a lad who will get you 25 to 30 goals a season.”
