The presidency has responded to enquiries about the health of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo after they received the COVID-19 vaccine. The duo took the vaccine jab on Saturday. In a statement, presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, said the President felt normal and went about his daily affairs. Shehu dispelled fears and misconceptions about the safety of the vaccine. He said if there are side effects that followed, the federal government would be open about it. “So far there is nothing of a side effect, serious or mild on the President. He is carrying on as normal. “We hope this will help to send a strong message among the people, especially those grappling with hesitancy about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine”, Shehu added.
