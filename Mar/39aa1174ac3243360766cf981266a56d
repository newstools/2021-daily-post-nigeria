MacKenzie Scott, the world’s 22nd richest person and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has married her new lover, Dan Jewett. The couple, who announced their marriage in a statement released on Sunday, vowed to dedicate a majority of their wealth to charitable causes. Scott revealed that her philanthropic plans have not changed. According to her, “My approach to philanthropy will continue to be thoughtful.” “It will take time and effort and care. But I won’t wait and I will keep at it until the safe is empty,” she said. Her husband, Jewett also revealed that he plans to follow her lead, adding that he intends to give away the majority of his wealth. “I have been a teacher for the majority of my life, as well as a grateful student of the generosity of those around me. “This has meant doing my best to follow their example by passing on resources of all kinds from time, to energy, to material possessions when I have had them to give. “Currently, l am married to one of the most generous and kind people I know and joining her in a commitment to pass on enormous financial wealth to serve others,” he said. Reacting, Bezos, who shares four children with his ex-wife, in a statement released by Amazon spokesman, James Carney said he was happy for the new couple. “’Dan is such a great guy, and I am happy and excited for the both of them,” Bezos said. Recall that Bezos and Scott in January 2019 announced that their marriage of 25-years had ended. However, Scott became one of the richest people on Earth with a $53 billion fortune after receiving a quarter of Bezos’ Amazon shares after their divorce was finalized.
