Bayern Munich star, Thomas Muller, has refuted claims that Germany ‘stole’ Nigerian-born youngster, Jamal Musiala from England. Muller said he found “no English blood” in Musaila’s bloodline when the teenager pledged his international allegiance to Germany. A battle for Musaila’s International future raged between Germany and England with Nigeria hoping they can still acquire his services. But the young player chose Germany. Musiala represented England at the youth level, having grown up in London and spent time with Chelsea, he, however, opted to play for the land of his birth at the senior level. There were claims in the English media that Germany stole the player from England but speaking to Daily Mail, Muller said, “I don’t know if we stole him. “I looked at his bloodlines and there was no English blood in there!. “But we are very happy in Germany that Jamal decided on Germany. The set-up now, with his long contract to play in Bayern and decision for the German national team, fits very well.”
