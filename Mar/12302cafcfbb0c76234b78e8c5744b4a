A mother and her four children were burnt to death in a fire disaster that occurred in their home at Tanke area of Ilorin, Kwara State on Wednesday. DAILY POST reports that the father of the family was away when the disaster struck at Ifesowapo Community, behind ‘F’ Division Police station, Tanke, in Ilorin. Sources said the fire disaster was caused by candlelight as the area had been thrown into darkness for several days due to a downpour that damaged electric poles in the area. The candlelight which ignited the fire disaster burnt all domestic items in the room and spread to the occupied by the mother and her children while sleeping, burning them to death. The state fire service personnel that responded to a distress call put across could not do much as the victims had been burnt to death before their arrival. Awodun Yinka, Chairman of the community, told newsmen that some people heard the noise from a room and parlour self contained apartment and rushed down but were unable to rescue the children and their mother. According to his account, “We did not know about the tragedy on time, by the time we saw the smoke and rushed to the apartment to see what was happening, thick smoke had already enveloped the apartment, hence, we could not rescue any member of the family.” Yinka, confirmed that, “the fire was caused by candlelight which spread across the room while the family was already asleep.” He explained that the family must have resorted to the use of candlelight as a result of power surge, which has thrown Tanke area into darkness due to damaged electric poles caused by rainstorm in the area. Landlord of the house, Ibrahim Gana, who was also injured in the attempt to rescue the deceased family members from the fire disaster, appealed to the state government to assist them, particularly the only survivor of the incident now receiving medical attention at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital.
