The Kaduna State government has urged the state High Court to sentence Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, IMN, and his wife, Zeenat. Dari Bayero, lead Counsel made the call during the “secret trial” of El-Zakzaky and his wife on Wednesday, NAN reports. Bayero disclosed this while addressing journalists after Justice Gideon Kurada adjourned the case until May 25. He said the court was urged to overrule the defence, and sentence El-Zakzaky and his wife as provided by the law. The Counsel said the state had closed its case after presenting its 15th witness in the trial. Bayero said: “Our last witness has testified and the state has closed its case. “We are satisfied with the way the case has gone so far, we have presented 15 witnesses, including Army Generals, who are key actors and players that led to the filing of the case against the IMN leader. “As far as the state is concerned, it has tendered all the exhibits, and witnesses have come before the court and tendered evidence against the defendants. “One of our prayers is that the court should overrule the No-Case-Submission, overrule the defence, convict the defendants accordingly, and pass the necessary sentence as provided for in the law.”
