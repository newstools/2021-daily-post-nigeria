Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes has rated the teams’ chances of qualifying for the quarter final of the Europa after their Thursday performance at Old Trafford against AC Milan. Scholes said the Red Devils are now underdogs against the Italian side after a disappointing draw in the Europa League opening leg. He said the Italian giants are now favourites to progress to the quarter-finals after the 1-1 draw they secured in England. An Amad Diallo goal saw Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men take the lead as the game headed into stoppage time, but a 93rd minute equalizer by Simon Kjaer saw the match end in a draw. “Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] said they deserved a draw, I really don’t think they did, I think they got away with one, getting the draw,’ Scholes told BT Sport. “It’s a bad result. 1-1 at home is a bad result. We know they’re good away from home, but they’ve got to go and prove that now in a second leg which won’t be easy. “We’ve seen the qualities they have as well, they’re going to get some of their better players back as well. “It’s in the balance but AC Milan have to be slight favourites just because of the away goals they’ve got.”
