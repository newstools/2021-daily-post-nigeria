Rotimi Amaechi, the Minister of Transportation, on Saturday said Nigerians should stop distracting him with 2023 politics. Amaechi said he is not a politician, hence should be allowed to carry out his duties as a minister. The former governor of Rivers State, who appeared on Arise Television was reacting to questions on his purported 2023 presidential ambition. The minister pointed out that he was currently focused on ensuring that railway projects are delivered across Nigeria. Amaechi said mischief-makers misinterpreted his recent visit to Taraba State for a wedding mean the flag-off of his presidential campaign. According to Amaechi: “I went to Taraba for a wedding. At the end of the wedding, if you see plenty news that was out of Taraba. Mischievously, it was reported that I went to campaign, campaign to do what? “The election is about two years plus away, am I that rich even if I have ambition? I have told you, can you people allow me do my work? “I am the Minister for Transport and that is my responsibility, nobody should keep talking to me about politics, that was why I said on several occasions that I am not a politician. Please allow me do my work.”
