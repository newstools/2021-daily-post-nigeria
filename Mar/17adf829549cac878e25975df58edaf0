The Commandant General of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, (NSDC) Ahmed Audi has said that bandits in Nigeria have foreign sponsors. Audi made this known on Wednesday during the training workshop for state commandants of the NSCDC in Abuja. Audi noted that Nigeria is experiencing serious conflict and problems called asymmetric war which requires inter-agency collaboration among security agencies. “Following how events are unfolding in our nation, we are experiencing a serious conflict that I think in the history of Nigeria, this is about the first conflict that will give us a serious problem and the conflict is called asymmetric war.” The NSCDC boss called for all security agencies and Nigerians to work together to solve the insecurity before it gets worse. “We have had in the past some semblance of this type of war but the proper manifestation of it is the one we are seeing now. An asymmetric war is a war that requires all hands to be on deck if we really want to deal with it and nip it in the bud. “These guys are serious; these guys have international sponsors, so we need to come together,” the NSCDC boss warned. Audi advised the security agencies to avoid rivalry or service supremacy, adding that collaboration is needed to win the war against banditry. He, however, assured Nigerians that the NSCDC is working hard to rid the nation of the increased violence.
