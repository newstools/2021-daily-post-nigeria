Tottenham Hotspur boss, Jose Mourinho, is furious that some of his players have been leaking negative stories about his training methods and he is desperate to expose them, the Daily Mail reports. Spurs went on a miserable run of form earlier this year, losing three successive Premier League games for the first time ever. They then won five straight matches, before losing 2-1 to Arsenal in the North London Derby and getting eliminated from Europe against Dinamo Zagreb. Those results have seen Mourinho’s future at the club called into question, while stories also emerged of discontent within the squad. After the defeat to West Ham, a report in The Athletic claimed players were questioning his overly reactive and defensive approach in games. They also felt training sessions were always geared towards negating the threat of the opposition. It was even suggested that Mourinho had spent “hours” in the build-up to facing Liverpool simply working on defending throw-ins. It is now believed Mourinho is so unhappy with the criticism about his sessions that the club is seeking to identify the players who may have been behind the stories.
