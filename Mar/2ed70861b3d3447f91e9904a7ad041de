President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the assassination attempt on Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State. Buhari in a statement signed by his media aide, Garba Shehu, said the string of brutal attacks on individuals and communities in Benue, with the latest one targeting the governor, was unacceptable. The President welcomed the dispatch of a team of investigators to Benue from the Police headquarters in Abuja. He admonished the officers investigating the attack to uncover who, or whatsoever, and bring them to justice. Buhari, expressing his sympathies to Governor Ortom and all Benue indigenes, warned that the unfortunate incident must not be politicized, reiterating that an attack on one Nigerian is an attack on all Nigerians. “The President has directed the Police to undertake a thorough investigation into the attack involving the governor and into all such incidents affecting individuals and communities in the state. “Let there be open and transparent investigation and whoever is linked to it should be caught and be made to face the law,” the statement read.
