President Muhammadu Buhari has sent wishes to former President Olusegun Obasanjo, one day after his birthday. It is not clear if the belated birthday message was an oversight. However, the very vocal former Obasanjo clocked 84 on Friday and received many birthday wishes from Nigerians from all walks of life In a statement on Saturday by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, Buhari said Obasanjo served the country with loyalty and huge dedication. The Nigerian leader wished the retired General, continued good health and happiness. Buhari said the nation will continue to look up to the former President for wisdom and statesmanship. He asked God to sustain Obasanjo with greater wisdom and strength to continue his good works for the country.
