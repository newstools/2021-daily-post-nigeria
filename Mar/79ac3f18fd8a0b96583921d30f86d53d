The Oyo State Police Command, on Tuesday, explained the rationale behind the release of three members of the Odua Peoples Congress (OPC). DAILY POST has earlier reported how the three OPC members who were arrested on Sunday were released. Our correspondent learnt that the OPC members were arrested after they arrested Isikilu Wakili, a Fulani herdsman. Wakili has been accused of masterminding series of attacks, killings and kidnappings cases in Ibarapa geo-political zone of the state. DAILY POST reports that Ibarapa zone had witnessed a series of security breaches due to notorious activities of suspected Fulani herdsmen who were accused of terrorising innocent citizens. Among notable persons killed in the zone by suspected gunmen in the last few months are Mrs. Sherifat Adisa and Dr. Fatai Aborode. On Tuesday, unconfirmed information surfaced in Ibadan, the state capital that the arrested OPC members had been transferred to Abuja for further investigation, though the police command insisted that all the OPC members are still in Ibadan. Police Spokesman, Olugbenga Fadeyi told DAILY POST that the OPC members are still in Ibadan, contrary to insinuation that they had been transferred to Abuja. Fadeyi told DAILY POST that the OPC members are still at the Criminal Investigation Department, Iyaganku in Ibadan. DAILY POST however learnt that the three OPC members have been released after much pressure from stakeholders. Public Relations Officer of the State Police command, Mr. Olugbenga Fadeyi who confirmed the release of the OPC members Tuesday night, noted that the trio were released on health grounds. Fadeyi maintained that the OPC members were released on Tuesday due to their health status. He said, “They have been released due to their health status.”
