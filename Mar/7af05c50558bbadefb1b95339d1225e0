The police in Ogun State said it arrested “two members of Aiye confraternity on Sunday, over their involvement in the attack of a vigilante. Police disclosed that the suspects’ arrest followed a report lodged at Ijebu-Igbo divisional headquarters by one Salami Azeez. Azeez had reported that while he was on duty as a vigilante at Aleke area of Ijebu-Igbo, about 1:30am, he saw three boys moving around the area; and when he challenged them about their mission at that ungodly hour, they allegedly attacked him with an iron rod, inflicting serious injury on his head. Consequent upon this, the DPO of the Ijebu-Igbo division, SP Kazeem Solotan, mobilized his patrol team and moved to the scene where two of the suspects – Balogun Opemipo (26 years old) and Korede Onabanjo (27 years old), were arrested, and the third one escaped. “Upon their arrest, the policemen discovered them to be among those on their wanted list for their involvement in various cult-related clashes in Ijebu-Igbo and its environs. “On interrogation, the two suspects confessed to be members of the dreaded Aiye cult group terrorizing the area for quite some time now,” Ogun police spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said on Monday. The case is to be transferred to the State CIID as directed by the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun.
