Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, says he knew Fulham would cause his side problems following the Reds’ 1-0 defeat against the Cottagers at Anfield. Klopp said that Fulham are in a good moment, adding that the goal Liverpool conceded before half-time was a massive blow. According to the German, his players tried to score against Fulham but were unable to do so against the visitors. Mario Lemina’s fine strike late in the first half ensured Fulham defeated Liverpool at Anfield. Liverpool are now four points off the top four position on the Premier League table. “Fulham will cause us problems – it’s clear,” Klopp told Sky Sports. “They are in a good moment, they are a good team. We all agree a team like this should stay in the Premier League. “There were moments we could have had more of an impact on the game. Conceding that goal before half-time was a massive blow. “We tried to react, and the boys showed that. In the end, we don’t score goals, and that’s a big problem.”
