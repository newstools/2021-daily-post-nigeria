The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arraigned Peiter Borremans and Nkechi Borremans before Justice E. A. Obile of the Federal High Court, in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. The Dutch couple were arraigned, alongside Lagon Trade Limited, on two-count charges bordering on conspiracy and obtaining by false pretences. EFCC said the couple, on or about July 31, 2014, obtained $330,000 from Jackkyson Multi Services Limited and Alot General Services Limited. The money, received by false pretext, was an advance payment for the purchase of a Marine Tanker Vessel. The offence run afoul of Section 1(1) (a) and (2) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act 2006 and punishable under Section 1(3) of the same Act. The defendants pleaded “not guilty” to the charges. N. A. Dodo, the prosecuting counsel, prayed the court for a date for commencement of trial and sought their remand in a Correctional Centre. C. A. Okowanya, defence counsel, informed the court of oral applications for the bail and prayed they be remanded in EFCC custody due to the second wave of COVID-19. Justice Obile adjourned the matter until March 31, 2021, and remanded the defendants in EFCC custody.
