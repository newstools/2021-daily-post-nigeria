Buba Marwa, Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on Tuesday ordered officers to wipe out drug cartels in Lagos State. The retired General gave the order when he visited the agency’s command in Lagos. Marwa noted that the state had 30 percent of the total drug abusers in Nigeria. “In the country, an estimate of 15 million people belong to one or more aspects of illicit drug dealing. About 4.5 million people in Lagos State are into illicit drugs.” Marwa listed factors responsible for the illicit drug scourge in Lagos as population, presence of two seaports and airports and a high number of unregistered medicine sellers. Lagos commandant, Ralph Igwenagu, recalled that 471 drug offenders were arrested at various locations in 2020. The figure comprised 424 males and 47 females. “This year, the Command seized 11,798 kilogrammes of various illicit hard drugs and 722.31 litres of the same illicit drugs (liquid) from dealers and joints,” he said.
