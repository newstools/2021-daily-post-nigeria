The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said all its aspirants for the Anambra State governorship election are billionaires. The party, however, declared that money would not be the deciding factor in who emerges the candidate. Ali Odefa, PDP National Vice Chairman (South East) spoke on Monday in Abakaliki at the party’s stakeholders meeting. The official advised the aspirants to approach the grassroots for support. “I told them that they are rich and are all billionaires but money is not the issue presently. “I told them to keep money aside as the party is more interested in reclaiming power”, NAN quoted him as saying. Odefa said the same measure would be applied in contestes for elective positions in other South-East states. The vice chairman affirmed that the delegates, not party leaders, will decide the Anambra flagbearer. Odefa dismissed fears of favoritism and assured of a level playing ground.
