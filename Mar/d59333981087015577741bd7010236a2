Chelsea midfielder, Jorginho has revealed his teammates with ‘big brains,’ and he is among the three midfielders he mentioned. According to him, “Oh yes, big brains [Kante, Jorginho and Kovacic have big brains].” But he admitted that the other two have more legs than him. The Brazilian-born Italy International also suggested that the football Chelsea play now under Thomas Tuchel is much better than it was under sacked manager, Frank Lampard. Tuchel, a former Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain manager, took over at Stamford Bridge after Lampard was dismissed in January. “So, for me, it’s a good way to play football that I like and enjoy, and I think it’s better for my characteristics than playing long balls, and second balls,” Jorginho was quoted by Express Sport. “When it’s Kova [Mateo Kovacic], his style is to play short, to come, so I know if he wants to play one-two or when he wants some space to move forward and to dribble. “So, I just try to help him, either give him the space, or come over to help him and give him an option – whatever he needs to get out of the situation. “With Kante, it’s kind of the same. When you play with your mates, you need to understand each other, and understand their characteristics as well. So, I know that Kante has big power, so I tell him when he can turn. [For Kante its about talking]: “Turn! Man on!’ or talking so he knows I’m there for the short pass. So, I just try to give him an option to do a one-two and get out.”
