Obinna Kalu, a 35-year-old resident of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, has been arrested by the police for allegedly shooting a co-tenant, one Adijat Balogun, at her right rib. The Ogun State Police Command’s spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this to DAILY POST on Thursday. Oyeyemi said Kalu committed the crime at noon on Sunday and fled the house. The case, it was gathered, was reported at Sabo/Ilupeju divisional headquarters by one Olayiwola Kareem. Kareem was said to have informed the police that while the victim was sleeping in her room, the suspect, who had always been at loggerheads with the woman, sneaked into her room and shot her. “Upon the report, the DPO Sabo/Ilupeju division, SP Mustapha Opawoye quickly led his men to the scene where the victim was quickly rescued to State Hospital, Ijaye, before she was referred to Federal Medical Centre, Idi-Aba, Abeokuta,” the PPRO stated. After carrying out the act, it was learnt that Kalu quickly packed all his belongings and ran away. He was hunted by the police and arrested on Tuesday with the help of members of the public. “On interrogation, the suspect initially denied being the person who shot the victim, but when he was asked for the rationale behind his sudden action of evacuating his belongings and running away from the house, he was unable to argue further,” While the victim is still recuperating at the hospital, the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, directed that Kalu be transferred to the homicide section of the state CIID.
