The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has arrested an ex-Registrar and Chief Executive Officer of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof. Dibu Ojerinde. Azuka Ogugua, the ICPC spokesperson, confirmed this in a statement on Wednesday. Ogugua said Ojerinde allegedly committed different frauds to the tune of N900 million while heading JAMB and the National Examination Council (NECO). He is being detained over allegations of multiple identities, abuse of office, money laundering, tax evasion and making false statements to public officials. Ojerinde is also being questioned for allegedly awarding fraudulent contracts to shell companies that cannot be traced. “He was alleged to have awarded contracts for the supply of pencil and eraser at the cost of N450 million each, to Double 07 Concept Limited and Pristine Global Concept Limited, respectively, between 2013 and 2014 while heading JAMB”, ICPC said. The commission said there is no evidence to show that the items, which are examination materials, were supplied as the contractors cannot be found. According to the ICPC, similar contracts were allegedly awarded to Solid Figures Limited, Holywalk Limited, and other companies for various sums without any trace of execution. Prof. Ojerinde will be charged to court after the conclusion of the investigation.
