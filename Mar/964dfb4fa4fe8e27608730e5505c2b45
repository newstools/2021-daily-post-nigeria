Northern Elders’ Forum, NEF, has blamed the crisis bedevilling every nook and cranny of the country on politicians’ inordinate ambition to the detriment of peace and unity. The forum also noted that the failure of the government of the day was responsible for the threat on the country’s unity. The forum, in a statement by its Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, advised the government to ensure that the country is not divided but must do everything to strengthen and ensure its unity. The NEF believes that the weakness of President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration was aggravating various threats in all strata of the country. It alleged that political actors, who have political ambitions in 2023, are threatening the corporate existence of Nigeria, not minding the welfare of its citizens. The forum lamented that the politicians were attacking the foundations of the country’s co-existence through acts that provoke, frighten or otherwise cast doubts in the minds of the citizens. The Northern Elders advised President Buhari to ensure that the unity of the country was not negotiable. The forum wondered why the only voices being heard were those demanding the balkanization of the country, or encouraging dangerous politics and other acts that pitch some communities against others. The NEF stressed that, “It is no exaggeration to say that our country has never been so threatened by a combination of weak and ineffective governance and a determined effort from many quarters to capitalize on this weakness to attack the foundations which give all citizens and communities some comfort that we are not headed for almost certain, irretrievable disaster.”
