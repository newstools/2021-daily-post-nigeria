FIFA could ban Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, after his outburst in Portugal’s recent World Cup qualifier against Serbia, according to Corriere Dello Sport. Ronaldo could be sanctioned for storming off the pitch in Portugal’s controversial 2-2 draw against Serbia on Saturday. The Portugal captain stormed off the pitch before the final whistle after he was denied a clear winner in their draw with Serbia in a UEFA World Cup Group A qualifier. Stefan Mitrovic attempted to clear Ronaldo’s off the line, but despite his efforts, it crossed into the goal. However, referee Danny Makkelie waved on the play and there was no VAR or goal-line technology to check the call. An angry Ronaldo confronted the linesman, which earned him a booking and led to his protest. The 36-year-old later took to Instagram to defend his actions, arguing that he felt his country was being harmed. However, Ronaldo’s antics could get him a penalty if FIFA deems it “offensive or a violent conduct”. If so, the former Real Madrid and Manchester United star could be slapped with a one-match ban.
