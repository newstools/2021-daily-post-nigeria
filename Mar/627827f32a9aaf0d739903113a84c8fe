The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has arrested a tutorial centre operator for collecting N6,500 registration fees from would-be UTME candidates. The operator, Bayo Olajide, who owns Perfect Tutors centre in Koroduma, Oneman Village, Nasarawa State, allegedly engaged in the act even while JAMB is yet to commence the sale of forms for the 2021 examination. Dr Fabian Benjamin, JAMB’s Head of Media, told journalists that, Olajide who claimed to tutor candidates for the university examination confessed that his highest educational qualification is an “O Level” certificate. “He was arrested and when asked, he said he is a tutorial person, that he has been teaching candidates for the exam, but the tragedy of the story is that he is not even qualified to sit for the exam himself” “These tutorial centres are used to collect money from candidates and perpetrate exam malpractices, Dr Benjamin, revealed. “Parents should know there is no shortcut to success. He is collecting N6,500 from candidates even when the JAMB fee is not even up to that amount,” He said. Bayo, in his confessional statement, claimed to have received money only from one candidate. He said out of the N6,500 he collected, N4,700 was for the JAMB exam registration while the balance will be for his services, lectures and others.
