Senate Chief Whip, Orji Kalu, has linked his time in prison to the 2023 presidency. In a statement by his spokesman, Peter Eze, Kalu said politicians were claiming he was suffering from prison experience. NAN reports that the All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain described his opponents as “little-minded”. “My conspirators thought I would be president in 2023, so they decided to cut my journey short at all cost,” he stated. Kalu pointed out that Joseph in the Bible went to prison. He also cited former President Olusegun Obasanjo. The lawmaker added that the episode was part of life’s script and that he had moved on. Senator Kalu was sentenced to Kuje Correctional Centre for 12 years on December 5, 2019 for allegedly misappropriating N7billion as Abia Governor. On May 8, 2020, the Supreme Court upturned his trial and conviction by Justice Muhammed Idris of the Federal High Court in Lagos. The court declared that Idris lacked the jurisdiction to try the matter, having been elevated to the Court of Appeal.
