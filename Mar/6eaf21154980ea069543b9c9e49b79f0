The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has intercepted illicit drugs worth over N2 billion at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA) Ikeja, Lagos. The agency arrested three suspected traffickers in connection with the crime, the spokesman, Femi Babafemi said. He quoted the Commander, NDLEA MMIA command, Ahmadu Garba as saying that one of the suspects, was arrested on Sunday, March 28. The Nigerian was apprehended during the outward clearance of passengers on Air Maroc. A 7.1 kg of Methamphetamine, carefully concealed in food spices and packed in a Swiss polo suitcase, was found in his possession of the suspect. NDLEA put the street value of the drug bound for Spain at N2 billion. The statement noted that the closure of borders, occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, was responsible for the surge in the price of drugs. “For instance, the price of meth in Australia had increased from $200 to $600 per gramme due to supply cut, hence the desperation by the traffickers and barons alike,’’ Garba said. The Command also intercepted a suspect at Skyway Aviation Handling Company (SAHCO) export shed of the airport with 800 grammes of Cannabis Sativa. Operatives also seized 19.950 kg of green leaves suspected to be khat, concealed in foodstuff bound for Dubai, UAE. In a follow-up operation, a suspect was also arrested in connection with the seized cannabis.
