Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has rubbished the ongoing membership registration and revalidation exercise of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Wike said this when he received former APC stalwart in Emuoha Local Government Area, Azundah Nkomadu into the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the commissioning of the 16.85km Rumuji-Ibaa-Obele-Isiokpo Road crossing Emuoha and Ikwerre LGAs of Rivers State. The Governor said APC lack the moral right to embark on membership drives across the country, especially in Rivers State where the impact of the party is not being felt. The Governor, therefore, called on Rivers’ people to shun the ongoing registration and revalidation exercise of the All Progressives Congress. According to Wike, “They will come to you now and say come and register in our party. There is something for you. Ask them where was this road when you were here. This road was here you didn’t do it for us you now want us to come and register in your party. “When they tell you to register in their party, tell them to do road for you. Tell them to come and complete those schools they abandoned”.
