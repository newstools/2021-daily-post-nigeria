Two suspected armed robbers have confessed to the police that they broke into the house of one Pastor Godwin Ojerinde of God’s Will Praying Ground Siun in Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State and took away his car. The suspects, Oshilaru Bidoun (male) and Tolulope Oluwafemi (female), told the police the car was sold in Ogere area of Ogun State to someone who took it to the northern part of the country. Police said the two and three other members of their gang had invaded the pastor’s house at about 3:15 am of February 9, “armed with guns and other dangerous weapons.” “The hoodlums held the pastor and his family hostage, ransacked the house and dispossessed them of one Pathfinder SUV with registration number, WDE-38-MM, one Samsung A20 handset and one Infinix Hot note handset,” the Ogun State Police spokesperson said in a statement on Tuesday.  Oyeyemi explained that the DPO Owode-Egba division, CSP Mathew Ediae, after receiving the information, embarked on an intensive technical and intelligence-based investigation alongside his crack detectives to unravel those behind the heinous crime. After weeks of painstaking investigation, the duo of Oshilaru Biodun and Tolulope Oluwafemi were apprehended based on a tipoff, it was learnt. “On interrogation, they both confessed to being parts of the robbery syndicate. They confessed further that the Pathfinder SUV has been sold to someone in Ogere Ogun State and that the vehicle was on its way to the Northern part of the country. “The detectives quickly started tracing the vehicle, and it was eventually recovered in Mokwa Niger State,” Oyeyemi explained.
