Prince Harry’s wife, Meghan Markle, has accused her dad, Thomas Markle of betrayal and selling her out to the press. Meghan and Harry has been in the news ever since she accused the Royal Family of being racist during an explosive television interview with Oprah on Sunday. She also revealed that she contemplated committing suicide after joining the royal family. However, in a newly released footage from the Oprah interview, Meghan while addressing why her relationship with her father, Thomas fell apart, said she has ‘found it hard to reconcile’ with Thomas Markle for insisting he had not been speaking to the media. The Duchess of Sussex has said she felt betrayed when she found out her father was working with Tabloids, adding that she cannot fathom hurting Archie the way her own father ‘betrayed’ her before the royal wedding. ‘I look at Archie, I think about this child, and I genuinely can’t imagine doing anything to intentionally cause pain to my child. “If we’re going to use the word betrayal it’s because I asked him, when we were told by the comms team that a story was going to be coming out which the tabloids had apparently known for a month or so and decided to hold until the Sunday before our wedding because they wanted to create drama. “This is also a key point in all this, because they don’t report the news, they create the news. “When I asked him about it, I told him we won’t be able to protect our own kids one day and this kids happen to be his grandchildren too. I asked him one more time to tell me the truth and he wasn’t able to do that. And that for me has really resonated, especially now as a mother.’ “I look at Archie, I think about this child, and I go I genuinely can’t imagine doing anything to intentionally cause pain to my child. I can’t imagine it. So it’s hard for me to reconcile that,” she said. She, however, said her father had assured he had ‘absolutely not’ spoken to the press but couldn’t believe him.
