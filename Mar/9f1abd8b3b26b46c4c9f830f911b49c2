Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, has narrated how the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, helped his ambition in 2015. Obasa made the revelation on Friday, during the inauguration of the Agege-Pen Cinema Bridge in the Agege Local Government Area. The Speaker, who represents Agege 01 in the Assembly, took over from ex-speaker Adeyemi Ikuforiji in 2015. While thanking Tinubu on Friday, the first speaker from Agege said, “Before I joined the House of Assembly, I started as a councillor here in this local government. Our first primary election took place in Airport Hotel. If not for his (Tinubu)’s intervention. We had about five delegates or six and about contestants. I had three (votes), the other person had two (votes) and another person had one and the person with one vote left to join the man that had two, making 3-3. “If they had suspended that election, that would have been the end of it but because of his (Tinubu) intervention, it was resolved, there and there and that was the first time of Mudashiru Obasa in the Lagos State House of Assembly and without that there wouldn’t have been a speaker from Agege. Asiwaju, we thank you. God will bless you. God will continue to sustain you,” Obasa said.
