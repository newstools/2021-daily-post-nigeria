Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez, has been left ‘very angry’ as Manchester United approached Villarreal centre-back, Pau Torres, according to Spanish outlet El Desmarque. Perez sees Torres as the perfect long-term heir to Real Madrid captain, Sergio Ramos, who is out of contract with Zinedine Zidane’s side at the end of the season. Torres has a relatively affordable release clause of €60million (£51million). The 24-year-old has a growing list of admirers following a string of brilliant displays in LaLiga and the Europa League this season. Man United are also keen to sign Torres at the end of the season with the Red Devils manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a huge admirer of the Spain international. Solskjaer is determined to add a new centre-back in his squad whom he can rely on in fitness terms, with Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly proving fitness concerns occasionally so far this season.
