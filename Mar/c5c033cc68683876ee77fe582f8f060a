Social media actors in Yobe State and elsewhere around the country have been warned to desist from linking Governor Mai Mala Buni with the 2023 presidency. Isa Sanusi, Senior Special Assistant on Digital Media to the Governor gave the warning in a statement made available to newsmen on Tuesday. “This is to inform all social media actors who make posts linking or associating our leader H.E. Hon. Mai Mala Buni with 2023 to please IMMEDIATELY remove such post and desist from such reckless posts. “Making such a post is both unlawful and careless. “Posts like ‘Daga Daura sai Buni’ are also uncalled for and should be removed”, the statement frowned. The Digital Media Aid also urged all social media gladiators to use the platforms responsibly and avoid posts that are unauthorised. “Once again, we have to use social media RESPONSIBLY and stay away from posts that are unauthorized and violates the law”. “Those who come across this post should act on it please, and inform others”.
