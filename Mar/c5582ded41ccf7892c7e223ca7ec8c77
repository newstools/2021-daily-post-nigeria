Borussia Dortmund striker, Erling Haaland, wants to become the highest-paid player in Premier League history this summer and will ask interested clubs to pay him £600,000 per week, the UK Sun reports. Europe’s top clubs are expected to battle over the 20-year-old this summer. Dortmund will make up to £130 million in profit on Haaland, who they signed for just £20m less than 16 months ago. Haaland has gone on to prove himself as one of the deadliest strikers in world football, scoring 49 goals in 39 games for the Bundesliga side. Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea are all interested in signing Haaland this summer. But any move for the Norwegian could cost a total of £300m over the duration of the striker’s contract, with his agent Mino Raiola demanding around £600,000-a-week for his client’s services. Alexis Sanchez is the current record holder for the highest-paid Premier League player. The Chilean earned close to £500,000 a-week at the Old Trafford once bonuses were taken into account.
