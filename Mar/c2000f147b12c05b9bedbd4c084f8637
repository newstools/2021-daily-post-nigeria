Hoodlums and illegal tax collectors in Cross River have physically assaulted and dehumanised two petty traders for allegedly not paying their tax. The victims were identified as Mr Chuks and Mrs Chukwuma. DAILY POST gathered that the incident occurred at Marian Market and 100 Marian Road respectively, in the Calabar Municipal local government area of the state. It was learnt that the wares being sold by the woman was seized by hoodlums masquerading as tax collectors while she was given 7 days to pay or lose her goods. Confirming the incident, the Chairman, Cross River Anti Tax Agency, Bishop Emmah Isong regretted the attitude of the hoodlums who masquerade as tax collectors. Isong in a press release made available to DAILY POST on Thursday, said, “The tragic incident which occurred on Wednesday, March 17, 2021, at the Municipal local government area of the state in which one Chuks, was dehumanised by illegal tax operators in Calabar, is despicable. “There is also a reported case where one Mrs Chukwuma, a widow with 4 children leaving at 8 miles, was allegedly manhandled and her goods impounded by hoodlums masquerading as tax collectors and given 7 days to pay up or lose her goods” he stated. Condemning the act, the Chairman said “These acts are not only condemnable but the highest art of uncivilised manner of collecting tickets, tolls and tax by any agents in whatever name. He urged the perpetrators to desist from such inhuman act of extorting people of their hard-earned money as it is against the Cross River State Tax exception law. Bishop Isong called on all government agencies in charge of revenues to carry out their functions under the laid down best practices to give succour to poor citizens.
