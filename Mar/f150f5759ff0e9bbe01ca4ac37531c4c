A Mapo Customary Court sitting in Ibadan on Friday dissolved a six-year-old marriage between a cleric, Abdulrasheed Olalere and his wife, Mariam, on grounds of infidelity. Olalere in his reply to a divorce suit filed by Marian, accused her of infidelity and attempts to elope with her lover. ”I caught Mariam in bed sleeping with another man when she was just four months pregnant. ”I was angry with her but we settled the matter. The man also laid claims to the baby. But after medical reports, revealed that the date given by the man proved him wrong about the date of the pregnancy, I accepted her back. According to him, things were going well after interventions from different people until his wife started hanging with her lover again. “My lord, I caught her trying to elope with that same man. Mariam is wayward,” Olalere added. Mariam insisted that her husband was irresponsible and uncaring. She had nothing to say about the allegations that she attempted to elope with her ex-boyfriend. In his ruling, the President of the court, Chief Ademola Odunade held that the marriage was initially not built on a solid foundation of love and trust. Odunade consequently dissolved the union in the interest of peace, NAN reports. He awarded custody of the child to Mariam and directed Olalere to pay N5,000 for the child’s monthly upkeep.
