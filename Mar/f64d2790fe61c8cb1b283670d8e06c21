A Customary Court sitting in Mapo in Ibadan, on Friday dissolved a 26-year-old marriage between a Lagos-based businesswoman, Kemi Oyeniyi and her husband, Olusola over ”voodoo” suspicion. Oyeniyi who rejected any peace effort at resolving the matter pointed out that her husband would have killed her, if not for her faith. “If I had known that Olusola was a wife killing husband, I will not have married him. ”I missed so many opportunities to work in Saudi Arabia because Olusola opposed the idea. ”I caught Olusola one day planting a broomstick on a footpath he knew I wiould pass. ”A few days before I travelled, my pastor told me that my husband had planted a killer-charm in my body and that I should plead with him to free me. “In Saudi, my children and relatives sent me many video recordings of how Olusola flirts about with ladies of his children’s age, even kissing them in their presence,” she alleged. However, the defendant consented to the divorce, but denied all the allegations levelled against him. ”She is a pathological liar who abandoned me immediately she returned from her trip abroad. “It is true that she sent me some money, but I made judicious use of it,” Olusola said. Delivering judgment, the President of the court, Chief Ademola Odunade dissolved the marriage in the interest of peace. Odunade granted custody of the first two children, aged 15 and 18 to Olusola and the last one who is 13 to Oyeniyi. He ordered Olusola to pay N5,000 for the child’s monthly upkeep, NAN reports.
