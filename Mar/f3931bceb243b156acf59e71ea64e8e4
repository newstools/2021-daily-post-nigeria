Kano State Consumer Protection Council (KSCPC) has intercepted a trailer loaded with repackaged milk products salvaged from a recent fire incident. KSCPC Managing Director, Baffa Dan-Agundi, made the disclosure on Monday, in a statement by the Public Relations Officer, Nabilu Kofar-Na’isa. The council said the seizure was to safeguard public health. Another vehicle conveying fake drugs into Kano was intercepted in the Wappa area of Fagge Local Government. “Preliminary investigation revealed the drugs are mostly sexual enhancement drugs without NAFDAC registration number,” Dan-Agundi said. The official reaffirmed the readiness of the council to rid the state of all fake, expired and unwholesome products. KSCPC urged residents to report persons suspected to be involved in illegal businesses.
