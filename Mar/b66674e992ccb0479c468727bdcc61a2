The member representing Arochukwu constituency in Abia State House of Assembly, Hon Mike Onyekwere Ukoha has resigned his membership of the All Progressives Grand Alliance(APGA) in the state. Ukoha was elected on the platform of APGA in the 2019 general elections across the state of Abia. His resignation from APGA was announced in a letter, read by the Speaker, Rt. Hon Chinedum Enyinnaya Orji, during plenary session of the State Assembly. In the letter, the Abia lawmaker, cited deep internal and irreconcilable crises that have rocked the party(APGA) for years in the state. He further said that there have been divisions and factions plaguing the party for a long time hence the reason for dumping the All Progressive Grand Alliance(APGA). However, Hon Ukoha did not state his next political move in the letter read on the floor of the State House of Assembly. In another development, Ukoha representing Arochukwu state constituency, decried devastating and reoccurring security breach in the constituency. Ukoha lamented the attacks on the constituents by their neighbors from Igbanja in Akwa Ibom State, which according to him, led to the beheading of an indigene of Arochukwu by invading marauders over boundary dispute. Ukoha described the situation as unimaginable in this 21st century, calling on the members of the National Boundary Commission(NBC) to intervene in the lingering crisis.
