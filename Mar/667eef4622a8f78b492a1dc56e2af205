The Olori-Ilu of Imope, Chief Kolawole Omotayo, who was kidnapped on Saturday by unknown gunmen has been released. DAILY POST reliably gathered that the community leader was released around 10pm on Tuesday. A close ally of Omotayo told our correspondent that the high chief retired to a hospital after his release. The source who does not want to be mentioned said, “ransom was paid, but I don’t know the exact amount.” But, the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said he was not aware of any payment of ransom. Oyeyemi told DAILY POST that the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, personally led a team to the area on Tuesday, saying police did everything to effect the release of the Olori-Ilu of Imope on Tuesday night. He said no arrest has been made so far, adding that “we are after them”. The head of Imope, Ijebu North Local Government area of Ogun State was abducted along Oke Eri-Imope road, while driving down from Ijebu-Ode. It was reported that his abductors fired shots at his vehicle to deflate his tyres, after which, they pulled him down and dragged him into the bush.
