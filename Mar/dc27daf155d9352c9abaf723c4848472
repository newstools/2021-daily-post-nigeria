The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday said “anything could happen” in reference to the zoning of its 2023 presidential ticket. The main opposition, however, said a final decision will be announced after the resolution of all pending issues. The Board of Trustees Secretary, Adolphus Wabara, briefed reporters on the resolutions of an emergency meeting held on Wednesday. The board members discussed the situation in the party nationwide as well as the political and economic tension in the country. Wabara disclosed that the meeting deliberated the stability of all organs and placed them on alert as the party prepares to take over power in 2023. On the ticket, he said: “By the time we resolve all the issues in the party, we shall come up with a zoning formula.” The former Senate President affirmed that the constitution of the PDP recognizes zoning. Wabara said there could be “political exigencies” that may require going back to the drawing board. “Anything can happen. That is why we can amend our constitution at will to win an election,” he added. The BoT Secretary stressed that PDP is the only party in Nigeria that is owned by the people not anybody.
