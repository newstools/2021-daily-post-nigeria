Liverpool boss manager, has revealed that all that his boys want is just to win matches at the moment. The Reds were beaten by Fulham, a bottom 3 team at Anfield on Sunday making their chance of finishing in the top four slimmer. Mario Lemina’s first half strike was Scott Parker’s relegation battling side need to give the title holders their 6th straight defeat. “My boys want to win football games, I know that. We got enough knocks to make it clear that we really want it with all we have. We couldn’t do it, that’s the problem. But when he says that, the winner is always right,” Klopp told Liverpool official website. “Believe me, these boys want [it] but it doesn’t work in the moment and there are some reasons for it: we don’t score goals and we concede at least one, which in the moment looks like it is enough against us. “They wanted to win this game today. I saw that. We made mistakes still, that’s the problem, but that’s not about you don’t want it – the boys don’t want to make mistakes, we just made them. “We have to make sure the mistakes we make are not accountable anymore, so like you can concede a goal – we conceded goals in our best phases, the best periods of our lives, but the only thing is then you are not bothered about it. That’s where we have to come. “
