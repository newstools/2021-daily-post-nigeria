Nigerian Singer, Seyi Shay has responded to backlash over her harsh criticism of a 17-year-old contestant on Nigerian Idol. Audition for the sixth season of the Nigerian Idol music show began in March with contestants showcasing their singing talent. Seyi Shay while reacting to a singer’s performance on Sunday, described it as terrible. She said: ”You are never going to make money being a singer. “Who told you to come for the audition? Whoever it is, you should go back and tell them they are not your friends. That was not a good one. You have a sweet, token voice but your performance is terrible.” The statement of the singer has since attracted reactions from Nigerians who described her judgement as too harsh and condescending. Responding to the backlash, Seyi Shay on her Twitter page wrote: “ I’m feeling like JudgeJudy right now. You either LOVE her OR you HATE her, and that is quite ALRIGHT! “Either way, Thanks for the #1 trend tweeps .”
