People living with diabetes have been warned against consuming honey or zero sugar soft drinks, which are said to be harmful to them. The warning was handed down at the weekend by an expert and consultant endocrinologist, Dr Sule Bathnna, in a lecture on how to prevent and manage diabetes at the investiture of the Emir of Misau, Alhaji Ahmad Suleiman, as chairman board of directors of the Diabetes Association of Nigeria (DAN), Bauchi State chapter. The consultant endocrinologist submitted that both honey and zero sugar drinks were not good for the consumption of diabetics, adding that they must abstain from consuming them as they were harmful to their health. He, however, said those without diabetes could consume such drinks and honey as they were better alternatives for sugary ones for them. While saying that diabetes is incurable, Bathnna said preventing and or managing the disease was the best option against complications and deaths as a result of it. In her remarks at the event, the state chairperson of the Diabetes Association of Nigeria (DAN), Hajiya Uwa Shehu, informed that the association was established with the objective of educating people on the disease and providing support for patients. She further informed the association organized monthly enlightenment lectures at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital (ATBUTH) in Bauchi to diabetes patients on how to cope with the disease. On his part, DAN National President, Dr Alkali Mohammed, commended the Bauchi State chapter of the association for its enlightenment campaign on the disease. According to Dr Mohammed, DAN was a member of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), adding that the association regulated all other diabetes organizations in the country.
