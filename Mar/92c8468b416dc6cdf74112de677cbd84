Former Manchester United goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel, has hammered at Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, for what he did after his side’s Europa League exit on Thursday. Mourinho’s men crashed out from the Europa League round of 16, second-leg tie as Mislav Orsic scored twice to take the match to extra-time before claiming his hat-trick to ensure Dinamo qualified for the quarter-final on a 3-2 aggregate. Mourinho went straight to Dynamo’s changing room to applaud their players just immediately after Tottenham crashed out from the competition. Reacting to the development, Schmeichel said it would never have happened with former Man United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson. According to him, Mourinho should be in Tottenham’s dressing room, talking to his players and making sure they understand what has just happened is unacceptable. “If that was my manager [Mourinho], doing that after the game, and I was part of what happened there, I’d seriously cross,” Schmeichel told CBS Sports. “He’s got to go back to his dressing room and do whatever a manager does behind closed doors. “He’s playing up to social media, detaching himself from the events. “He should be in the dressing room, talking to his players and making sure they understand what has just happened is unacceptable. You would never see Sir Alex Ferguson do that.” Video: Despite just crashing out of Europe, Jose Mourinho went to Dinamo Zagreb’s changing room to applaud their players.
