Zlatan Ibrahimovic has come out of his five-year international retirement and will play for Sweden again this month. The 39-year-old who is his country’s record goalscorer, has been named in his latest squad for their World Cup qualifiers against Georgia and Kosovo. Ibrahimovic netted 62 times in 116 matches for Sweden before retiring after their group stage exit at Euro 2016. The AC Milan striker had offered hints of coming out of retirement recently, as a meeting with coach Janne Andersson suggested he was willing to return. Andersson said: “When Zlatan opened up for games in the national team, it felt natural and important to meet and discuss this as soon as possible. “I am glad that we managed to get a meeting so quickly.”
