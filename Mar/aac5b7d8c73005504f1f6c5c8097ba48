The Osun State Government will on Thursday launch the State Identification Cards and reflective jackets for both commercial motorcyclists and tricycle riders. The government said the development was implemented to ensure security of lives and property of the people of the State. This was disclosed in a statement issued by the Special Adviser to the governor on Works and Transport, Engineer Hussein Toke Olaniyan. Recall that Oyetola had ordered a full documentation and registration of all commercial motorcycle operators in the State or risk suspension of their operations. He maintained that failure to comply with this new directive will lead to suspension of commercial motorcycle operations across the state.
