The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Kukah, has accused Nigerian politicians of engaging in spiritual activities to win elections. Bishop Kukah said politicians do not believe they can win elections through hard work, hence they resort to spiritual activities. The clergyman who spoke during a virtual interview with a historian, Prof Toyin Falola, yesterday said lack of “predictors” was responsible for the tide. He also charged religious leaders to resist any attempt by the politicians to contaminate their faith. He said: “Nigerian politics as you can see from Okija to other places has become so highly spiritualised and this is what happens in an environment when there are no predictors, there are no signs. “Nigerian politicians don’t believe they can just win an election by fighting hard, so they are expecting you to pray for success of their political enterprise. “It is not about electoral outcomes or how well electoral laws are; it is that we are operating in an environment that is so dubiously spiritual.”
