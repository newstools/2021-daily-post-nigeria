Chelsea left-back, Ben Chilwell, has singled out goalkeeper, Edouard Mendy, for praise following the Senegalese’s impressive display in the Blues’ Premier League 0-0 draw against Leeds United on Saturday afternoon. Mendy recorded his 19th clean sheet in the Premier League this season against Leeds at Elland Road. The 29-year-old denied Leeds from scoring when he pushed a curling effort from Tyler Roberts over the bar before producing a magnificent save to deny Raphinha on the half-turn from close range. “When it comes down to it, we can rely on Edu [Mendy],” Chilwell told BT Sport after the match. “Them one or two opportunities in a game that he has to concentrate (on) and make vital saves for us. “We know that he is going to do that for us.” Chelsea’s next game is against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie on Wednesday night.
