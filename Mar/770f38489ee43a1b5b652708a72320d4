Ronald Koeman has listed players that would replace superstars, such as Lionel Messi, Gerard Pique and others at Barcelona. Barcelona lined up in a 3-5-2 initially, with Antoine Griezmann partnering Lionel Messi as the attacking duo in their win against Osasuna on Saturday. Defender Jordi Alba made full use of his advanced role and registered the opener for Barça, which was then doubled by Ilaix Moriba, scoring his first goal for the club. And after the game Koeman listed down some players he thought would dominate Barça headlines in the future. He named Ilaix among them, saying “Players like Pedri, Moriba, Puig, Araújo and Mingueza are the future of this club,” he told the press. The former Everton boss also pointed out that despite the win, his did not perform to the expectations of the fans.
