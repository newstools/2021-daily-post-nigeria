Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, will only re-sign for Real Madrid if they call him, Marca reports. Ronaldo is being linked with a return to Spain, three years after he left for Serie A. However, he wants Real to show how serious they are about bringing him back. Ronaldo is convinced he can still contribute a lot to Madrid, having netted 30 goals in 34 games this season. The Portuguese superstar left for Juventus, with the ambition of helping them win the Champions League, but he has so far failed to do so. The Italian champions bet on Andrea Pirlo, an iconic player but a rookie coach, in this crucial season and it has failed as they were dumped out of the Champions League last 16 by Porto. However, Ronaldo has seen some of the criticism come his way and could be looking for a way out.
