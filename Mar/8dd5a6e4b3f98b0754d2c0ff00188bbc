The Zamfara State Police Command has assured that the ground and aerial team deployed by the Inspector-General of police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu will continue to sustain the ongoing ground and aerial surveillance patrol in the state. The commissioner of police, Mr. Abutu Yaro congratulated Zamfara State government and parents of the just-released schoolgirls, assuring that a full-scale investigation is presently in progress, and that anybody found in connection with the abduction would not go unpunished. In a press statement signed by the state police commandâ€™s spokesman, SP Mohammed Shehu, the commissioner noted that the number of abducted students were 279 and not 317 as earlier announced.
