Chelsea midfielder, Kai Havertz, has said he has to “improve” and will be making “no excuses” about his poor form. Havertz arrived at Stamford Bridge last summer for £70 million. However, the 21-year-old has found life tough in England, with injuries and a loss of form working against him. Havertz told reporters on his experiences so far: “Corona is now over, I feel good. “I had a little injury in the past few weeks, but it is now time to play good. “I have to improve my game. It is not been easy for me but there are no excuses. “I just have to keep on working and hopefully there will be a big turnaround soon, but I will give it my best.”
