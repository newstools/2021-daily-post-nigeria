Real Madrid is planning to sell up to six players, in a bid to fund the transfers for Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe. Mundo Deportivo reports that Eden Hazard, Gareth Bale, Sergio Ramos, Raphael Varane, Isco and Marcelo are on the chopping board. The LaLiga giants are desperate to land both Haaland and Mbappe this summer. Haaland will be available for £65 million when his release clause becomes active next season. But the Norway striker is expected to be targeted by top European clubs this summer. He could cost as much as £150 million at the end of the season. Mbappe, meanwhile, has no release clause and is contracted at Paris Saint-Germain until 2022. The French forward could cost considerably more, especially as PSG does not want to sell but Mbappe has admitted in the past that he dreams of playing for Real Madrid and this could force the club’s hand.
