Gubernatorial candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) during the 2019 election in Kogi State, Barrister Natasha Hadiza Akpoti has declared that the present economic environment is not conducive for women. She made this disclosure while speaking at the Oyo Women Entrepreneurship Summit (OWES) held on Wednesday in Ibadan. Akpoti decried the unhealthy business environment for entrepreneurs in Nigeria, especially women. She, however, called on the government to support women entrepreneurs who were usually confronted with the problem of raising capitals for their business enterprises. She also called for more affirmative action from government to improve the participation of women in politics. According to her, no business could strive without an idea. She stressed the need for women entrepreneurs to get the right ideas that would make their businesses to flourish. Mrs. Folasade Faparusi, a speaker at the event, posited that women must have multiple streams of income in order to have financial stability. She called on women to embrace more vocational skills and personal development in order to survive the harsh economic situation in Nigeria. She maintained that there were women who were doing the nations proud, while emphasizing the need for women to be courageous, ready to take risk, manage their time because Nigeria as a nation needs women to take on leadership responsibilities. Faparusi called on women to rise up to the yearnings of the society, discover their qualities and say no to the challenges of life. “Challenges are ladder to the next level; it is only when you are able to face challenges that you can move to the next level,” she said. Princess Aderonke Ramat Adedoja, the convener of the event, while speaking on the motive behind the program revealed that the programme was aimed at educating and encouraging women to rise up to the highest level by improving themselves towards occupying leadership positions in business and politics.
