The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), on Monday, arraigned Nanpan Salihu Yaniyang before Justice O. O. Abike-Fadipe of the Lagos State High Court, Ikeja. Yaniyang was charged with four-counts bordering on stealing and obtaining by false pretence. The EFCC said the suspect obtained the sum of N17,449,000 from Valerie Okoli and her co-investors in 2020, under the pretence that he would help them incorporate a company, and use the fund to invest in Forex. Yaniyang was also accused of collecting $6,300 in 2020, from the same persons and for the same purported purpose. The suspect pleaded not guilty when the charges against him were read. Ayanfe Ogunsina, prosecuting counsel, asked the court for a trial date and to remand Yaniyang in custody. Cyril Ebeh, defence counsel, informed the court that he had filed an application for the bail of the defendant. Justice Abike-Fadipe adjourned until March 29 for hearing of the bail application and ordered that the suspect be remanded at any of the Correctional Centres in Lagos.
