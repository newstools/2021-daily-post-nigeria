The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to begin the process of national healing by first of all, rehabilitating the houses of Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho and Seriki Fulani in Oyo State. The group also asked the government to compensate farmers both in the North and South, pacify cow owners and assist them to buy land for ranches. According to them, this may be expensive but yet costs less than war, adding that the ravages of war were better imagined than experienced. MURIC gave the advice in a statement signed by its director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola and made available to DAILY POST on Thursday. MURIC said, “The state of the nation demands that Nigeria must begin a national healing process. “The situation requires the immediate intervention of President Muhammadu Buhari as a statesman, not as a politician,” the statement said.. “FG can kick-start the process of national healing by rolling out a comprehensive plan of compensation for all those who lost properties and bread winners to clashes between herders and farmers. For example, the houses of Sunday Igboho and those of the Seriki Fulani of Igangan as well as the victims of the Shasha ethnic clash may be rehabilitated in the interest of peace.” MURIC reiterated its call for farmers whose crops were destroyed by herders’ across the country and cattle owners who lost their cows with genuine evidence to be compensated. “These steps cost a lot of money but peace building is expected to be expensive. Yet it costs less than war. The ravages of war are better imagined than experienced,” it added.
