AC Milan striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, has put his differences with Romelu Lukaku aside following their angry outburst in the Derby and invited him to the upcoming Sanremo music festival. The former Manchester United team-mates squared up to each other during the Coppa Italia quarter-final in January, which Inter won 2-1. Ibrahimovic was later sent off during the game after receiving two yellow cards. But the veteran Swedish striker has now invited Lukaku to the upcoming Sanremo music festival, where he is billed to perform. Ibrahimovic told reporters: “If Lukaku came to Sanremo I would welcome him. “There is no personal problem. What you do on the pitch stays on the pitch. If you want to come, you are welcome.”
