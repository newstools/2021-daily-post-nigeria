Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, on Monday, expressed sadness over the death of Justice Sylvester Ngwuta of the Supreme Court. Tinubu said Justice Ngwuta remained steadfast while order jurists lost their way. DAILY POST reports that Justice Ngwuta died on Sunday at the Abuja Teaching Hospital. Ngwuta was admitted for a week before he gave up the ghost. However, Tinubu described the late Supreme Court Justice as an erudite jurist whose knowledge of the law and its application was peerless. The former Lagos State governor stated this in a condolence message he personally signed. A statement by Tinubu reads partly: “Where others may have lost their way, Justice Ngwuta remained steadfast and calm in his analysis, producing a number of classical judgments, which will continue to be referred to in classrooms and courtrooms across the country long after his death and into the future. “I was saddened to learn of the passing of one of Nigeria’s most eminent and erudite jurists, Honourable Justice Nwali Sylvester Ngwuta.”
