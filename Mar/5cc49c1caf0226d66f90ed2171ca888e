The FCT Administration has issued a seven-day ultimatum to banks and other business organizations in Maitama, Abuja, to relocate to the Central Business District (CBD). The Acting Director, Department of Development Control, Garba Kwamkur, gave the warning on Tuesday. NAN reports that Kwamkur and FCTA officials inspected the gridlock at the popular Gana Street in Maitama. He said the visit was to sensitise business operators on the need to revert all the banks and other commercial hubs to their original allocated locations. Kwamkur recalled that a notification to the effect was served one week ago. He directed the banks and other businesses to relocate to the CBD or Idu Industrial Estate which the FCT master plan provided for. The director warned that their premises would be sealed off at the expiration of the seven days deadline.
