Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, has condemned the attack on some villages in Ishielu Local Government Area by suspected herdsmen. The killings took place Monday night in Nkalaha, Obegu, Amazu, Nkalagu and Umuhuali autonomous communities. At least, 15 persons were reportedly killed during the attack, allegedly carried out by herders. NAN reports that Umahi visited the communities on Tuesday to commiserate with the bereaved families. The governor charged all the security agencies to go after the perpetrators in order to bring them to justice. “We feel so sad that this kind of thing should happen in Ebonyi, we feel so worried for our country Nigeria and we are short of words. “We condemn this attack because it is capable of causing very serious killings, if allowed to continue this way,” he said.
