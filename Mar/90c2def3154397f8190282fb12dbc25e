The Kwara State Government has warned teachers in the state against dressing indecently to school. The Chairman, Kwara Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM), Malam Abubakar Bello, issued the warning in a statement signed by the commission’s Press Secretary, Mr Peter Amogbonjaye in Ilorin on Tuesday. The statement advised the teachers to abstain from all dresses capable of demoralising the public. Bello said decent dressing was necessary as teachers were perceived as role models in society. The Chairman advised them to adhere strictly to the dress code of the Civil Service as they were character moulders who should always show good example to the students. “You have to be role models to your students and shun immodest dress. “Teachers as character moulders should always show good example to their students. “You should form the habit of dressing decently in the course of discharging your constitutional duties,’’ the chairman added.
