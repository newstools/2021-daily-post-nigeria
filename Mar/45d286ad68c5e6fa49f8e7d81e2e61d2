An 18-year-old boy who specialised in hacking bank accounts has been arrested by men of the Ondo State Police Command. The teenage hacker, who expressed regret over his action, disclosed that he had been able to steal from bank accounts through stolen sim cards. The suspect, Samson Omisakin, was nabbed after stealing N44,000 from a victim’s bank account. According to Samson, he used to receive the SIM cards from his friends, Monday Isaac and Wanda Ajilogba who he said were into armed robbery. While revealing that a total of 18 SIM cards had been given to him by the robbers, the hacker stated that only few of the SIM cards were hacked successfully. Samson, who claimed to have graduated from Ibadan Polytechnic, was paraded at the police headquarters in Akure, the state capital alongside the two robbers. He maintained that he took to ‘yahoo yahoo’ business to make ends meet. “When I see my victims now, I will beg them and tell them will not do it again. I feel ashamed when spending and lavishing my victims’ money. “My mother has stroke and my father is no longer taking care of me. I started with Yahoo and I did it regularly. I studied Computer Engineering where I learn about hacking. I used applications to run victims sim card. I used the SIM to withdraw the cash through POS or used it to buy cards. “I collected 18 SIMs from them but many of them were not useful while some were useful. The one that brought me here was the one I collected N44,000 from. I took N4000 cash and used the rest to buy goods. In this case, I used somebody’s account and it was tracked to us.”
