National Chairman of Contact and Strategy Committee of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and the Jigawa State Governor, Muhammad Badaru Abubakar said the alleged rift between president Muhammad Buhari and the leader of the party Bola Ahmad Tinubu was created by mischief makers to hit the polity. Governor Badaru stated this yesterday while speaking on a Channels Television program. There have been reports of an internal crisis in the party between President Buhari and Bola Ahmad Tinubu which many projects could tear the party apart. But Governor Badaru said there is no misunderstanding between the two leaders. “There is no problem between the two leaders, some people just want to see that for their own personal reasons and it will not happen” “I believed it is politics, people just created and circulated stories that have no substances” “President Buhari, Tinubu and all leaders of the party speaks with one voice, It was just created to hit the polity by mischief makers” “We are in the true picture, we know what is going on, the party is one and one indivisible party and all stakeholders are being carried along in every decision, ww will prove that soon in our next Congresses and National convention” Badaru, however, promised that the All Progressives Congress will retain power in the 2023 general election. This is coming after the National consultative front predicted that the APC will most likely implode and scatter before the end of this year, 2021. Badaru said looking at how Nigerians troop to register with the party in the party’s registration and revalidation exercise, it is clear testimony and Nigerians have confidence in APC lead administration. “We started the process with the membership cards of 12m members and because of the demand we extended it 36m and still more members are asking for the card” “Also looking at how formidable politicians from major opposition party PDP and other parties trooping is a clear indication that the party is strong and will continue to be strong” He said as the Chairman of the Contract and Strategy Committee, he will work to ensure unity among members of the All Progressives Congress APC across the country. “The committee will work to bring back those that left the party and to woo new members that have good intentions for Nigeria,” Badaru stated.
