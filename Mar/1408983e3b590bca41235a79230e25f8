Former Chelsea star, Frank Leboeuf, has said midfielder, Mason Mount, is a ‘leader’ following the England international’s display in the Blues’ Premier League 1-0 win over Liverpool Chelsea on Thursday night. Chelsea defeated Liverpool at Anfield, thanks to Mount’s first-half goal to give Thomas Tuchel’s side all three points against the Premier League champions. Speaking after the game, Leboeuf told ESPN, “He [Mason Mount] is absolutely fantastic [and] he’s still a young lad, we should not forget that. “He [has played] under two different coaches, and he’s been perfect – and he’s a leader. He’s the kind of player that makes the difference.” He added: “What he did to Fabinho, how he found the corner, how he scored the goal, shows that he’s already matured and always makes the right decision. “Hats off, my man, carry on like that because you have a great future, for sure.” Mount will now hope to continue his spectacular display for Chelsea when they tackle Everton in their next fixture on Monday.
