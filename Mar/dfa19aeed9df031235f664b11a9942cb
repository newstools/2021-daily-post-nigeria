Georgina Rodriguez, the girlfriend of Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo, has opened up on the player’s behaviour at home after a bad result from a football match. She says Ronaldo is mature enough to accept such situations when results do not come as planned and always hopes for a better outcome from the next game. “Obviously if a match didn’t go well it’s not a ray of sunshine, but he knows that football is like this, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose,” the model told Sportsweek. She was responding to the question of how the 36-year-old Portuguese international handles a negative result on the pitch, adding that, “Cristiano is very mature.” Speaking further on her “husband’s” behaviour, Georgina said “it completely surprised me, conquered me. He is self-critical, responsible and loves what he does. The perfect mix “. The model has a child with the former Real Madrid star and also is the mother figure to the rest of his kids. Cristiano Ronaldo has four kids: Cristiano Ronaldo Jr., Mateo, Eva and Alana Martina.
