Atletico Madrid striker, Moussa Dembele, on Tuesday, collapsed and appeared to lose consciousness during the club’s training. Mirror UK reports that Dembele was going through stretches before falling backwards and lying motionless on the ground. The 24-year-old’s teammates quickly rushed to help him before calling for assistance from the medical staff, who spent some minutes trying to resuscitate the former Fulham and Celtic star. Dembele eventually recovered and was able to leave the pitch without help. It is believed low blood pressure was the real cause of the incident. Recall that Dembele joined Atletico Madrid on loan from Lyon last January. The player has, however, made just two LaLiga appearances for Atletico. He received a warning recently from Atletico Madrid manager, Diego Simeone, about his impact in games. “I always say that the number of minutes is not important. What matters is the quality of these minutes,” Simeone said. “I hope that Dembele can bring us what we hoped for when he arrived in the team.”
