An irate mob of sympathisers has killed a member of a child stealing syndicate, injuring one other, while trying to abduct a school kid in Nnewi. The spokesperson of Anambra State Police Command, CSP Haruna Mohammed stated this press release he made available to DAILY POST on Friday. Mohammed said, “On the 12/3/2021 at about 2:20 pm, there was a report at the Area Command headquarters Nnewi that a four years old child of St. Joseph School, Otolo Nnewi was returning home from school in company of his siblings when two men on a motorcycle grabbed the child and zoom off with him. “Alarm was raised by other children which attracted the attention of some commercial motorcyclists who pursued and eventually arrested the suspects and rescued the child at Akamili Community Nnewi.” Mohammed said before the arrival of the police patrol team to the scene, the two suspects were beaten to stupor by the angry mob but were eventually rescued by the police and taken to the hospital for medical attention. “Consequently, one of the suspects whose identity is yet known was certified dead by a medical doctor while receiving treatment and the second one is still unconscious at the hospital. Corpse deposited at the mortuary and investigation still ongoing. “Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police CP Monday Bala Kuryas, while thanking the public for their courage in rescuing the child also urged them to always exercise restraint by not taking law into their hands whenever they arrest suspects to enable the police conduct discreet investigation to in order unravel more facts surrounding the incidents including sponsors of the dastardly acts and bring them to justice,” Mohammed said.
