Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger, has revealed that he held talks with Jose Mourinho over a move to Tottenham, before opting to remain at Stamford Bridge. Rudiger struggled to play under Frank Lampard and was unsure as to where his future lied. The German defender was signed by Antonio Conte in 2017 and is now playing under his fourth different manager. He has been in and out of the starting XI and considered other options in the summer with a loan move to PSG close. The 28-year-old has however now become a regular under Thomas Tuchel, but his current deal expires next term. “I can’t give myself a contract,” he said at a press conference ahead of their Champions League tie against Atletico Madrid. “But I love it here at Chelsea. They will always be my priority No 1. “Even at the start of the season I was calm. Shocked is the wrong word. Some things I saw coming. Obviously that I was not in the squad I didn’t see coming. “But I took it on the chin. I was close. There were really two teams — mainly one — that I was considering. That was PSG. “There was also Mourinho. At the end of the day it didn’t happen. I was a bit upset. “But then I had the talk with the ex coach, Frank Lampard, and I worked my way back. Now things are going well for me.”
