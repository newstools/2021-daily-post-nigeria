Obafemi Hamzat, Lagos State Deputy Governor, has urged religious leaders to propagate peace to avoid Nigeria’s disintegration. NAN reports that Hamzat made the appeal on Tuesday during the 40-day Fidau prayer for late Lateef Jakande, former Lagos Governor. He advised clerics to guide citizens to act in accordance with the norms of the society and shun all anti-social vices. “People respect their religious leaders and listen to them. Please do not leave the preaching of moral values to the government alone”, Hamzat said. Sokoto Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, stressed that the completion of the Lagos blue rail project will be a testament to Jakande’s memory. Tambuwal said that the deceased served the state with admirable compassion and humility. “We all must learn from the late governor in terms of vision and commitment to building a viable state”, he said.
