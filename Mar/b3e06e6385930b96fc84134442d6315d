Former Liverpool player, Jamie Redknapp, has slammed Arsenal star, Kieran Tierney, for ‘moaning’ at his teammates after turning his back in the buildup to West Ham’s second goal against the Gunners in the Premier League on Sunday. Redknapp also accused Arsenal’s backline of not ‘doing their job’ against West Ham. Arsenal played a 3-3 draw against West Ham United at the London Stadium, thanks to goals from Jesse Lingard, Jarrod Bowen, Tomas Soucek, Craig Dawson and Alexandre Lacazette. “Watch Jesse Lingard, how bright and alive he is,” Redknapp told Sky Sports. “‘Everyone else is sleeping. He gets on the ball, he surveys the situation and plays fast. “That’s what you want to do. That’s a bright football mind. Look at the flip side from Arsenal’s point of view. As soon as the ball goes dead, not one person engages. “Nobody organises. Tierney, who we all talk about in glowing terms, he’s turned his back, he’s moaning. “Everyone in that Arsenal defence isn’t doing their job. It’s a really good finish from Jarrod Bowen.”
