The Federal Government on Monday joined other Africans and Nigerians in celebrating music stars, Wizkid and Burna Boy for their feats at the just concluded Grammys event. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in a statement issued in Lagos by his Special Assistant on Media, Mr Segun Adeyemi, described the much-deserved awards as fitting rewards for the persistent hard work of the duo. Mohammed said the awards also represented a global endorsement for the Afrobeat genre of music that has propelled Nigeria’s increasing dominance of the music world. He expressed hope that the clinching of the prestigious awards by Wizkid and Burna Boy would not only spur them to greater heights but would also serve as a source of inspiration for others. Recall that Burna Boy won the award for the Best Global Music Album, ‘Twice as Tall’. Wizkid won Best music video for ‘Brown Skin Girl’ with Beyoncé.
