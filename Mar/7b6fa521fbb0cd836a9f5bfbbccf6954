Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury have finally signed a two-fight deal for an undisputed world heavyweight title fight. The British boxers have been locked in negotiations in the past months. They have now finally finalised terms for the blockbuster battle, with a date and venue to be confirmed. Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, told Sky Sports: “All parties have now put pen to paper. “We will be working hard over the next few weeks to confirm the site and date for the biggest fight in boxing.” Joshua defeated Bulgarian boxer, Kubrat Pulev last December to retain his IBF, WBO and WBA titles, while Fury currently holds the WBC belt.
