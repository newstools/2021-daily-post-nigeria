Real Madrid boss, Zinedine Zidane has vowed that his side will not give up but “fight until the end” in the title race. Los Blancos were able to snatch a point against city rivals and league leaders Atletico Madrid in their clash on Sunday to keep their title hope alive. Karim Benzema struck late in the second half to cancel out Luis Suarez’s early opener at Wanda Metropolitano with so many wasted chances from the home side. The result leaves Zidane’s men five points behind, with one more game under their belt. And their French boss, after the game, declared that the current champions will contest their crown all the way through to the end of the season. “The objective is this, to continue,” he said when asked if his side still have a title shot. “We know there is a lot left [but] we are going to fight until the end. “Everything can always change. We are doing things well, we can improve. It is what we are going to do. “I am very proud of all my players. We are in the same boat and we are going to fight to the end.”
