The President of Kwara Baptist Conference, Reverend Victor Dada, has warned the Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq administration and Muslims in the state not to take the gentleness of Christians for weakness. He stated this while describing the Kwara government as government of the Muslim, by the Muslim and for the Muslim. Dada said this in a statement on Wednesday following the clash between Christians and Muslims at the First Baptist Church Surulere, Ilorin, Kwara State. DAILY POST reported that a clash broke out between Christians and Muslims over a controversy bordering on the use of hijab by Muslim students in Christian schools in the state. He said that no amount of pressure will make the schools allow the use of hijabs, adding that their schools are grant-aided and not public schools. According to him, the last 15 years have seen the government employing Islamic religious teachers in schools, while teachers for Christian Religious Knowledge are not employed. “It is surprising that the government has become a government of the Muslim, by the Muslim and for the Muslim in his (state governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq) policies, pronouncements and attitude,” the statement added. He said that at no time has any government designed uniform for schools ever since the grant aiding policy started in 1974. “This has always been the responsibility of the proprietors, be it community or mission,” he added. “The Muslims and the government should not take our gentleness for weakness. “We shall not allow the use of hijab in our schools. We will defend our faith and defend our inheritance. We demand that the government should return our schools.”
