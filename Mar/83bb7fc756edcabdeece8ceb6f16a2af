Chelsea midfielder, Jorginho, has taken a veiled swipe at the club’s manager, Frank Lampard, and hailed his successor, Thomas Tuchel. Jorginho lauded the work of Tuchel and aimed a thinly-veiled criticism of Lampard’s ‘long balls’. Tuchel replaced Lampard at Stamford Bridge last January after the Englishman was sacked. Chelsea are unbeaten in 14 games under Tuchel, moving up to fourth place in the EPL table and into the quarter-finals of the Champions League and the semi-finals of the FA Cup. However, Tuchel’s appointment has been particularly beneficial for Jorginho, who has become a key starter under the German, having been a bit-part player under Lampard. “The coach wants us having control of the game, playing from behind, even when the pressure comes,” Jorginho told Chelsea’s website. “So, for me, it is a good way to play football that I like and enjoy, and I think it is better for my characteristics than playing long balls and second balls. “When it is Kova [Mateo], his style is to play short, to come, so I know if he wants to play one-two or when he wants some space to move forward and to dribble. “So, I just try to help him, either give him the space, or come over to help him and give him an option – whatever he needs to get out of the situation. “With Kante, it is kind of the same. When you play with your mates, you need to understand each other, and understand their characteristics as well. So, I know that Kante has big power, so I tell him when he can turn. “With Kante, it is more about talking: ‘Turn!’ ‘Man on!’ or talking, so he knows I am there for the short pass. So, I just try to give him an option to do a one-two and get out.”
