Rangers boss, Steven Gerrard, has admitted it would be his “dream” to become Liverpool manager, but added he wants Jurgen Klopp to remain in charge for years to come. Klopp’s future has become a source of speculation in the last weeks, following the poor form of the Premier League champions. The Reds currently sit in eighth place and are in danger of missing out on the Champions League. Gerrard has been linked with a sensational return as manager to Anfield, following his Scottish Premiership title triumph with Rangers. When quizzed on his aspirations to manage his Liverpool, Gerrard told ITV: “We should not talk about this, we have one of the best managers leading our club at the minute, I love him. I hope he stays for a few more years. “Liverpool is my club. Is it a dream for me to one day be the Liverpool manager? Yes, it is, but not yet and who is to say I will ever be good enough. “There’s a lot of managers on this planet, we need to respect Jurgen first and foremost.”
