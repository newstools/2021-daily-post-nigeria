The Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP) have condemned attack on political leaders and politicians in Cross River State. Addressing a press conference at the Ernest Etim Bassey Press Centre in Calabar, Cross River State on Monday, the Chairman of CNPP, High Chief Christopher Eyibio regretted the continued attack on political leaders and politicians in the State. “We pride ourselves as a people who are united. We are known to be hard-working and honest. Why must we suddenly allow our political differences to destroy the State? “The Conference Of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP) views with great concern the unwarranted attacks on some leaders representing the State at different levels. “It is sad that these attacks are politically motivated, hence the sponsors of these attack dogs have a motive which is not far from the 2023 general elections” the group pointed out The CNPP said that the recent onslaught by Agba Jalingo on the person of Rt. Hon. Legor ldagbo demands an urgent response. “While we are not Hon. Legor’s media team, as concerned Leaders of political parties, we deem it necessary to caution that our continuous debasement of our leaders by sponsored agents is capable of orchestrating crises in the State. “As leaders of political parties, we have paid the price and sacrificed our time, resources and comfort to preach peace. This is why almost all our elections were crises free,” the group recalled. “Integrity is not built in a day. If we continue to pull down all our Leaders because they are not willing to settle us, we will indirectly destroy the State,” they opined.
