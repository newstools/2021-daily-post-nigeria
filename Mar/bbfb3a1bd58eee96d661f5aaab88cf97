Abdulrasheed Bawa, Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has charged all staff to be dedicated to duty. In his first address, Bawa expressed delight at the goodwill exhibited over his appointment, but warned against lateness to work, indecent or improper dressing. The chairman said though many were happy to have a chairman who is a friend to many, he would not tolerate indiscipline. “The rule says you must be in the office by 8am and close by 5pm if you have no pending work. But it is unacceptable for you to come in by 9am, close by 3pm and expect to earn a full salary,” he warned. Bawa stressed that his mission was not to undo what had been done by his predecessors but to improve the fortunes of the commission. He said all workers were important in the fight against corruption and urged them to come up with fresh ideas. Bawa promised to prioritize welfare, and improve on application of digital technology and intelligence. The chairman assured of regular staff training and disclosed that a Directorate of Intelligence would soon be created He further promised insurance cover to mitigate the dangers staff are exposed to in the discharge of their duties. Assuring open-door policy for easy access, Bawa publicly gave out his telephone number. The chairman visited the Abuja Zonal Office and the EFCC Academy for a similar meeting.
