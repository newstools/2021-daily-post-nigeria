Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich has began legal action, claiming he was defamed in a book titled ‘Putin’s People’ which was released last year. The book was written by Caterine Belton and contains several claims about Abramovich and others close to Russian president, Vladimir Putin. In the book it was alleged that the Russian billionaire bought Chelsea in 2003 under the special orders of Putin, who wanted to use the club as a conduit to increase Russian influence in the UK. Abramovich has now released a statement using the club’s official website, saying the book published by HarperCollins contains “a number of false and defamatory claims made” that have damaged his reputation and that of the club. He also insisted he bought the club solely for sporting reasons and that the huge difference in success after he bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003 can clearly be seen by all. Before Abramovich’s arrival, Chelsea’s only previous league title came in 1955. Since 2003 however, the Blues have won the trophy on five occasions and also won the Champions League in 2012.
