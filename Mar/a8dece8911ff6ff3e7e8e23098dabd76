The Presidency, on Wednesday, insisted that there is no rift between President Muhammadu Buhari and former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu. Presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, said the duo have a very strong commitment to the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Nigerian people. “Recent reports of a rift between the two leaders of our party are false; the handiwork of some media mischief makers”, he stated. Shehu accused the media of creating controversies and provisiding a nexus for naysayers who work behind the scenes planting such stories which are absolutely false. The aide said the administration was aware of pessimists and cynics who willfully spread misinformation to create doubts in the minds of the people about the relationship between its leaders and whether the party will remain intact or not. “There is no doubt that the President and the party are focused on development, peace and security, restructuring of the economy and war against corruption in the country and will not be diverted to anything else. This desperate attempt to fool the people will not succeed. “To President Buhari, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu remains one of the most respected political leaders in the country who has stuck to his principles in the face of all adversities. He was instrumental to the formation, growth and development of the APC into a formidable political party and the political alliance is waxing even stronger. “If Asiwaju is not a frequent face in the Aso Rock Villa, it is on account of the fact that he is not a cabinet member of this government. The fact that he is not every day around the Villa does not make him less of a friend to the President and this administration”, the statement added.
