The Academic Staff Union Of Universities (ASUU), Plateau State University (PLASU), Bokkos, has suspended the strike it embarked on, over some unresolved issues, including allowances. Recall that the Plateau State branch of ASUU had last Friday declared an indefinite strike. DAILY POST reported that barely a week after the University embarked on the indefinite strike, the state Governor Simon Lalong constituted a 7-Man Committee to look into the welfare of staff of the University. However, the Chairman of the union, Dr Bentse Pamson, in an interview with newsmen on Wednesday said the striking staff agreed to suspend the strike after much deliberation with the State Government’s 7-man Negotiation Committee, headed by the State Head of Service, Mr Azi Izang, on Tuesday, NAN reports. “Consequently, around 12.00am on Wednesday, we decided as a union to only suspend our strike and not to call it off, pending how committed and prudently the state government will implement the agreement it reached with us. “By this, it means any breach of the terms of the agreement shall see us resume the strike in full force,” Pamson said. He further revealed that students of the university have been pleading that the strike be called off to allow for the resumption of academic activities in the institution.
