Juventus manager, Andrea Pirlo, has defended Cristiano Ronaldo’s record at the club following criticism after they were eliminated from the Champions League against Porto. Sergio Oliveira’s 115th-minute free kick squeezed through the wall after Ronaldo had turned his back and lifted his leg up, as Porto progressed on away goals. Former Juve manager, Fabio Capello, described the 36-year-old’s role in their exit as “the worst”. The criticism led to various reports that Ronaldo was unhappy at the club and looking for a return to Real Madrid, whom he had left to join Juve, but Pirlo dismissed the rumours. “It’s normal that he’s disappointed, as is the whole squad,” Pirlo told a press conference ahead of the Serie A clash with Cagliari on Sunday. “And it is normal there are rumours after an elimination. “He is the most talked about footballer in the world alongside [Lionel] Messi – people are always talking about him. It’s worth reminding that he has always done well. “He has 90 goals in a hundred games for Juventus and has always shown his worth.”
