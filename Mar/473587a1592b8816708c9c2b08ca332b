Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Kayode Fayemi, said federal salary structure should not be imposed on states. The Ekiti Governor spoke at a meeting with pro-chancellors of state-owned universities on Thursday in Abuja. In a statement, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, NGF spokesman, said the meeting deliberated challenges the schools face. Fayemi stressed that federal and state governments do not have similar economic or financial situations. ”I, for example, do not have the resources of Lagos State, so you won’t expect me to earn the same salary as the governor of Lagos.” The governor admitted that states have been unable to pay salaries of their universities due to limitations. Fayemi told the pro-chancellors that the people appointed as vice-chancellors must speak truth to power. “They need to be able to bite the bullet, and not just be a yes person. We need to work together to confront these issues. “We are running glorified secondary schools as universities by this system and you have to help us in insisting that the institutions too, do the right thing”, he added. Fayemi agreed with the pro-chancellors that politics should not be involved in the nation’s school system.
