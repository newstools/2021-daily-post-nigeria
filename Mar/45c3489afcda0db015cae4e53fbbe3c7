Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has renamed Faulks Road, Aba, after the Governor of Old Imo State, late Dr. Sam Mbakwe. The road was named after Mbakwe following a request made by a student of DANIJOY International Schools, Umuahia, during Governor Okezie Ikpeazu’s lecture on “Building a New Nigeria through Democratic Leadership” Ikpeazu, who described public perception as critical to solving to a great extent the myriads of problems facing Nigeria, insisted that the society must learn to appreciate and promote leaders who served the public creditably. He said that our society must also promote the virtues of honesty, integrity and service, adding that the journey for a new Nigeria is a collective one as everyone is guilty of contributing to the many challenges bedevilling her. Ikpeazu also described early child education as key to the development of the child and called for the inculcation of same into the educational system of the country. Also speaking, the Head of DANIJOY International Schools, Ambassador Anthony Ororho, said that the School is an institution where parents of Igbo extraction living in the Diaspora in particular can bring up their wards in the enviable Igbo tradition with sound moral upbringing. Ororho lauded Governor Okezie Ikpeazu for his commitment to bequeathing qualitative education to the state.
