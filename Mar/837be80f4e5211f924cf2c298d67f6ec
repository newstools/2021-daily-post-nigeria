Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State has assured residents of the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine delivered to the state by the Federal Government. Umahi gave the assurance on Thursday, after receiving a jab of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, along with his Deputy, Dr Kelechi Igwe, NAN reports. He advised the people to be courageous to take the vaccine, notwithstanding the negative tales surrounding it, especially in the social media. He said: “I have been vaccinated and you can see that I am still standing and even stronger. “It is, however, not compulsory for people to be vaccinated but they must compulsorily observe the COVID-19 protocols, especially the use of face masks.” He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for showing exemplary leadership by ensuring the procurement of the vaccines and being the first to be vaccinated. “We would monitor the vaccination process to prevent lapses, which would undermine the desired objective. “The vaccination process, if not properly monitored, would create a situation where people might be asked to pay before being vaccinated and also lead to the influx of fake vaccines. “The state COVID-19 committee would supervise the exercise and the deputy governor, together with the commissioner for health, would sign all vaccination forms,” he said. Umahi said the state received 46,090 doses and that 13,000 dosages of the vaccine would be allotted to the elderly, who are above 60 years. “We recorded 49 negative cases of the 50 tests conducted recently but would not relent in efforts being made to check the virus,” he said.
