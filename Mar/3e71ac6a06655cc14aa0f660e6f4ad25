Tottenham Hotspur have lost a coin toss decider and will now wear their dark green away kit for next month’s Carabao Cup Final against Manchester City. The FA deemed that Spurs’ traditional white-and-blue home colours clashed with City’s sky blue shirts. A club statement read: “We can confirm that we shall play this season’s Carabao Cup Final in our away kit due to a colour clash with opponents Manchester City. “With our home Lilywhite and blue kit deemed to conflict with our opponents’ sky blue and white strip, we are required to wear alternative colours for the match, as determined by the traditional toss of a coin. “This will not be the first time we have worn our away kit in a Wembley Final – back in 1982 we memorably wore our change colours in our FA Cup Final success over Queens Park Rangers, while we also had to use our alternative strip in the away leg of our 1984 UEFA Cup Final victory over Anderlecht. “This season’s dark green away kit has already featured successfully in our run to the Carabao Cup Final, having been used for our hard-earned 3-1 win at Stoke City in the quarter-finals in December.” The Carabao Cup final will be played April 25 at Wembley Stadium.
