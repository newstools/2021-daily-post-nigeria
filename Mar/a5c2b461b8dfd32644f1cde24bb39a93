The Kaduna State Governor, Nasiru El-Rufai, has ordered the operators of Almajiri schools to leave the state. He spoke at the inauguration of the Kaduna State Child Protection and Welfare Committee on Tuesday. El-Rufai stated that he was confident and sure of the propriety of his administration’s actions. ”My message to all those that have almajiris in Kaduna state, you have a choice to relocate otherwise sooner or later we will get you.” He said the government had developed and approved a social protection policy to support the most vulnerable. “Politicians often get involved with their ‘slot mentality’, and when we give them those slots, they don’t give them to the poorest.” El-Rufai said the social investment office has been working across the 24 local government areas to have a comprehensive social register of the poorest. The governor added that more than one million households in Kaduna have been registered.
