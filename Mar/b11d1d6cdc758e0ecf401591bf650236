Ahead of Sunday’s North London Derby, Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta has insisted he is not interested in the battle for supremacy in London. According to him, such will come automatically if the Gunners become Premier League champions. Arsenal face Tottenham, with only Fulham and Crystal Palace from the London contingent below them in the table. Spurs, West Ham and Chelsea are all ahead of Arteta’s men in the table. “No,” he said to the Mirror, when asked if being the fourth-best team in London was acceptable. “We want to be the best – and not in London. “We want to be the best in the league. “That is the standard we have to try to reach because of the expectation we have and what this club has done over the years. “I’m not interested about London. I’m interested about the whole country and being the best in the country.”
