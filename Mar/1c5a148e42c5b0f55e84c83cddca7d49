The Police in Anambra State says it has arrested two persons in connection with the Sunday morning shooting in the capital city of Awka. There was a heavy shooting on Sunday morning by a purported cult gang, which left two suspected cultists dead and leaving residents in panic. The shooting which happened at Eke Awka market roundabout saw churchgoers and roadside traders scrambling to safety, while the violent youths had a field day, shooting at each other. DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, the police spokesperson in Anambra who revealed the arrest of the suspected cultists said they will be charged to court after investigations are completed. He said, “Police Operatives have arrested two (2) persons suspected to have been involved in clashes between rival cult groups in the early hours of 28th March 2021, along Ifite Awka and Zik’s Avenue in Awka South LGA. “The shooting led to the death of two unidentified young men, whose bodies have been deposited in the mortuary for preservation and autopsy. “Meanwhile, adequate security has been put in place to forestall the further escalation of the incidence, while a full-scale investigation to determine the culpability or otherwise of the two (2) arrested persons as well as to arrest fleeing members of the cult groups, has commenced.” Ikenga, however, did not disclose the names of the two arrested suspects.
