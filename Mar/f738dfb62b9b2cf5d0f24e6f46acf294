Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Buba Marwa on Thursday recommended that a drug test be carried out on politicians and anyone running for public office. The retired General made the recommendation during a meeting with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu at Marina in Lagos. Marwa noted that running for a public office was a big responsibility and such responsibilities cannot be carried out if one keeps over dozing on drugs. “Running for public offices is a big responsibility and to carry out this important assignment for the public one has to do that with a clear head and not one is filled up because of drugs. “The drug scourge is now an epidemic in Nigeria. The prevalence is 15 per cent; three times the global average. One in seven Nigerians takes drugs. “Also, our recent findings reveal that there is a nexus between drug use and crime,” he said. Marwa further appealed to the government to lead the way with the integrity drug test for students in the state, adding that youths are affected most when it comes to drug abuse.
