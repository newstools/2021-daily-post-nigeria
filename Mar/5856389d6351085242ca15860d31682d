The United States has announced plans to recommence visa interviews and other consular services in Nigeria. The U.S. Consulate General in Lagos gave the hint at the unveiling of its expanded pavilion. Claire Pierangelo, the Consul General, noted that the renovated pavilion will provide a new safe space for visa applicants to socially distance while waiting for their appointment. She assured the consulate is working hard to reschedule the visa applicants that were affected by the pandemic. Pierangelo said the consular customer experience is continuously improved on, as Nigerians’ main interaction with the consulate is through the section. Liliane Hudspeth, the Consular Chief, explained that the new pavilion offers visitors a larger, more comfortable covered waiting area, protection from sun, rain, as well as a great view of the Lagos lagoon. “We have put in place safety measures that not only protect our visa applicants but also consular staff who serve those applicants,” Hudspeth said. William Bridgeland, the Management Officer, lauded the cooperation between the U.S. Consulate Facility Maintenance team and the local Nigerian construction contractor. The U.S. Consulate General Lagos is one of the busiest consular sections in sub-Saharan Africa. The consulate received an average of 1,000 visa and American Citizen Services customers per day, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
