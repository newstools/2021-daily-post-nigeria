Former Liverpool star, Mark Lawrenson, has predicted that Manchester United would beat West Ham United 2-1 in tonight’s Premier League tie at Old Trafford. Man United are currently in the second position on the Premier League table with 54 points from 28 games, while West Ham are in the fifth position with 48 points from 27 games. The Old Trafford club head to the game after playing a 1-1 draw with AC Milan on Thursday, while West Ham defeated Leeds United 2-0. Providing his prediction, Lawrenson told BBC Sport: “Manchester United’s win at Manchester City was a great result, and they got it with their best performance of the season. “West Ham will bring a different sort of problem for United, though, and it’s one that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side haven’t always solved this season. “Rather than going at them, as City did, the Hammers will sit in, and United will have to take the game to them. “The Hammers carry plenty of attacking threat too, though, and both sides will be full of confidence. “It could be very close, but I am expecting it to be much livelier than when West Ham came to Old Trafford in the FA Cup last month. Man United 2, West Ham 1.” The kick-off time for Man United vs West Ham is 8:15 pm.
