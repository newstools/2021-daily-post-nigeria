Nigerian troops foiled an attack by Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists in Jakana, Borno State, on Sunday. The fighters stormed the area firing machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades from gun trucks. An intelligence officer told PRNigeria that the prompt response from the air component of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) assisted the ground forces to repel the insurgents. The source said ISWAP attempted to overrun the town to loot food items, drugs and also invade a military formation to loot arms and ammunition. “The prompt response from the air taskforce saved the situation as some of the terrorists met their waterloo in superior gunpower from the gallant troops.” The ground troops have commenced a clearance operation of the area. Jakana is 25km from Maiduguri. It is a crossing route for ISWAP terrorists moving between their camps in the Benisheikh forest area of Borno and hideouts in the Buni Yadi area of Yobe. The terrorists, who repeatedly attack the community and military base in Jakana, appear in military uniforms and mount roadblocks to kidnap commuters.
