The Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa, on Friday officially assumed duty as the head of the anti-graft agency. Bawa replaces Ibrahim Magu as Chairman of EFCC, following his nomination by President Muhammadu Buhari to the Senate, which confirmed him. Magu was sacked following his indictment by the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami. Malami had accused Magu of corrupt practices. However, speaking at the Commission’s headquarters in Abuja, Bawa pledged to fight corruption ravaging the country. He also promised to steer the organization towards a proactive and intelligence-led investigation. Bawa said he would create a full-fledged directorate of intelligence that would spearhead intelligence gathering, which will ensure a proactive response in the fight against corruption. He said: “We are going to digitize our processes and we are going to create a new full-pledged directorate of intelligence to enable us to gather intelligence so that we will be proactive in our fight against economic and financial crimes. “By so doing, we will also provide the government with necessary quality advice that will lead to good governance”. Reiterating his remarks before the Senate at his confirmation hearing, the new EFCC boss promised a paradigm shift in the agency’s approach to anti-graft war, from fighting corrupt persons to fighting corruption. “There is a difference between fighting corruption and fighting corrupt people and we are going forward. We are going to be proactive in our approach in the fight against economic and financial crimes.”
