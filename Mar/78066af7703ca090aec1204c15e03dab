Premier League teams have been informed by refereeing chiefs that they will come up with a plan to “change and improve” the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system ahead of next season, the UK Times reports. VAR is being implemented for the second year in England’s top flight. However, it has been marred by controversial incidents. Clubs were told at a Premier League shareholders meeting on Thursday, that changes would be passed on to officials, so that they could work on them this summer. The plan will revolve around consistent decision making and marginal offsides. The referees and match officials have been accused of lacking consistency as it concerns red cards and penalty calls. Similar incidents have been officiated differently, which has caused frustration while several dismissals have been overturned upon appeal.
