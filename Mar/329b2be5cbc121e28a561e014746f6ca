The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) says it is aware of the forces behind the bill seeking to transfer minimum wage from the exclusive list to concurrent list. The President, Ayuba Wabba, spoke at a meeting with the leadership of the House of Representatives on Tuesday in Abuja. The bill passed second reading at the House on February 23. The labour leader stated that the bill, if passed into law, would return Nigeria to slavery. He argued that the minimum wage was part of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention. Wabba insisted Nigeria must respect the convention being an ILO member state. The NLC President dismissed the position by some states that they cannot sustain N30,000 monthly wage. “No one can negotiate below the N30,000, the ILO convention is binding on Nigeria as a sovereign state and not on subnational like states”, he said.. House Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila said the green chamber would look into the demand by labour.
