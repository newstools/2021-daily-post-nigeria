At least, 113 persons have been arrested for violating COVID-19 protocols in Lagos, against government guidelines. The suspects were arrested for nightclubbing in the state, an activity said to be a major distributor of the virus. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, paraded the violators at the Command Headquarters, Ikeja, on Monday. The state police spokesman, Muyiwa Adejobi, said the violators were arrested on Sunday at Garbana Club, Ajao Estate and DNA Club, Victoria Island, by police operatives, including the Lagos State Taskforce led by the Commander, CSP Sola Jejeloye. Odumosu, while parading the suspects, vowed to go after club owners and their landlords, who contravene the town planning approvals of the state by converting their properties meant for other purposes to night clubs, Oyeyemi said. He emphasised the need to make the suspects scapegoats to serve as a deterrent to others in the state. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police had pronounced the deployment of the DPO of Ajao Estate and his senior officers for allowing night clubbing and violation of other COVID-19 protocols in the area.
