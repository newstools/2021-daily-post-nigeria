Arsenal loanee, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, has admitted he prefers to play in central midfield. The 23-year-old is currently on loan at West Brom from Arsenal. Maitland-Niles was struggling for playing time under Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, earlier this season. The player had started just five times in the Premier League for Arteta’s side before he joined West Brom in the January transfer window. The England international has played in several positions since making his breakthrough at the Gunners, but he has been given a chance to impress in central midfield under West Ham manager, Sam Allardyce. However, Maitland-Niles has now revealed that he is keen to get more game time in that position because he feels comfortable in the central midfield. “Versatility can be positive or negative. It depends on your outlook,” Maitland-Niles said as quoted by Metro UK ahead of West Ham’s clash with Arsenal on Sunday. “Sometimes, you’re stuck in the position where you’re waiting for a chance, and you can play anywhere because of your versatility. “Sometimes, you become the main player straight away, and it doesn’t affect you. But sometimes you can be caught out by it. ‘I want to play in the centre of the pitch because I feel comfortable there, and there’s a lot of things I can bring by playing in the middle.”
