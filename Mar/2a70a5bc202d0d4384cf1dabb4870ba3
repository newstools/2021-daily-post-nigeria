A Mobile Court in Benin, the Edo State capital, on Friday convicted 33 people for flouting the coronavirus protocols in the State. NAN reports that the prosecuting counsel, Mr G. O. Odeyibo told the court that the 33 accused who subsequently pleaded guilty were arrested within the Benin metropolis. Oyedibo said that 21 accused persons were arrested for not wearing face masks and for failing to maintain social gaps in public as directed by the Federal government. According to him, six out of the 33 persons were arrested for not disposing their wastes properly at Oba Market. Delivering judgement, Chief Magistrate Rusberth Imafidon convicted the 21 face mask violators and directed them to do community service for three hours daily for two days without any option of fine. He also sentenced the six convicts, who did not dispose their wastes properly at the Oba Market, to do community service of three hours for one day. The Chief Magistrate pointed out that doing community service was in tune with non-custodian sentence. He directed the correctional officers to oversee the convicts while serving their punishments.
