Hundreds of staff of Shoprite in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, on Tuesday, staged a protest to kick against nonpayment of their entitlements. Those who spoke to DAILY POST, noted that they staged the peaceful protest over the decision of the management to hand over the affairs of the shop to a new company without proper arrangement for the staff. Our correspondent reports that some of the staff carried placards to demand for their entitlements. Some of the placards read, “5-10 years without promotion and you want to abandon us” “No handover till pay off” and “we must be settled by Shoprite before they run”.  Branch Chairman, National Union of Shops and Distributing Employee, Coco-Mall, Dugbe, Mr. Silvanus Obisha, who spoke during the protest, said the protest is happening simultaneously in all Shoprite outlets across the country. Obisha said the union has sealed all the Shoprite outlets in Ibadan and other states to press home their demands. He explained that all efforts to meet the Management of Shoprite have not yielded results.  He also alleged that members of the management team were not ready to dialogue with the workers. However, the Human Resources Manager in charge of Shoprite at Ring Road in Ibadan, Mrs. Kagho, when contacted, insisted that she was not authorized to speak to the press She said, “Yes. I am aware of the protest. But, I am authorized to speak to the press.”
