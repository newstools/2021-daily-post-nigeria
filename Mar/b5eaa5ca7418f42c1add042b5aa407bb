Juventus midfielder, Aaron Ramsey, could be set for a shock return to England with Liverpool, Calciomercato reports. The 30-year-old has been hampered by injuries this campaign and has started just 12 of the clubâ€™s 27 Serie A matches so far. Ramsey joined the Italian giants as a free agent from Arsenal in the summer of 2019. He had an impressive start to life in Turin, but his reputation has been hit this season. The Welshman now finds himself in a position where he is no longer an automatic starter, with manager Andrea Pirlo seemingly preferring the likes of Arthur, Weston McKennie and Rodrigo Bentancur. Ramsey remains a popular figure at the Emirates and has been linked with a return. But it is believed two other Premier League clubs have joined the race for his signature, those being Liverpool and West Ham.
