President Muhammadu Buhari, on Thursday, urged the international community to further collaborate on tackling the major threats across the globe. The Nigerian leader said terrorism, insurgency, displacement of persons, and climate change posed real threat to human existence. Receiving Letters of Credence at the State House, Buhari urged diplomats to work towards building stronger relations, with focus on providing joint solutions to rising human and natural challenges. Buhari welcomed High Commissioner of The Gambia, Mohamadou Musa Njie; Ambassador of South Korea, Kim Young-Chae; Ambassador of Slovak, Tomas Felix; High Commissioner of Australia, John Gerard Donnelly; High Commissioner of Bangladesh, Masudur Rahman and Ambassador of Guinea Bissau, Jaao Ribeiro Butiam. The President told the envoys that coronavirus remains humanity’s greatest threat as it does not only affect public health, but also has a devastating effect on people’s economy and livelihood. He assured the new Ambassadors that Nigeria enjoys very good bilateral relations with each of their countries, and there was a need to enhance the cordial relations for the joint benefit of citizens. “In addition to the fraternal relations between us, the one thing Nigeria has in common with your countries is peace. Peace is priceless, desirable and crucial to sustainable development and achieving the targets set by the UN global initiatives. “It is therefore imperative for us to work individually and bilaterally for sustainable peace. Achieving global peace is vital to attaining food security. Peace and food security should be pursued simultaneously”, Buhari said.
