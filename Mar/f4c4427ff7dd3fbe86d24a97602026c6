A Niger Delta based group, Network for the Defense of Democracy and Good Governance, (NDDGG), has reminded the Federal Government that antecedents have been laid in return of recovered loot. It said the case of recovered £4.2 million from James Ibori shouldn’t be different. In a statement signed by Hon. Williams Igweh, Director of Operations of the group, he said the money should be returned to Delta State the same way, it was in the past returned to Plateau and Bayelsa states, in the interest of fairness, equity and fair play. The group commended the lower chamber of the National Assembly for standing with the people when it passed a resolution last week, that the recovered loot should be returned to Delta State government. Members of the House of Representatives in a motion of “urgent national public importance”, last week, passed a resolution that the recovered £4.2 million be returned to Delta State.” The plenary was presided by the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase. The lawmakers had “insisted that the fund was stolen from Delta State and as such should rightly be returned to the state for the development of its infrastructure.” The NDDGG faulted the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federarion, Abubakar Malami for his earlier statement that the fund would be used to finance the construction of the second Niger Bridge, Abuja-Kano road, and Lagos-Ibadan expressway. They asked the Exonomic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and other anti-graft agencies to wade in so as to pre-empt attempts to divert the fund. DAILY POST recalls that the UK had on Tuesday March 9th, 2021 signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to return the sum of £4.2 million stolen by former Delta State Governor, James Ibori, to Nigeria.
