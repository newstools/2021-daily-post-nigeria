The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has said no date has been fixed for the registration of 2021 UTME. The exam board on Tuesday in a post on its official Twitter page urged the public to disregard any news making the rounds on social media of a fixed date. JAMB noted that the date will be announced publicly once it is confirmed. The post read: “IMPORTANT NOTICE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC “This is to inform the general public that no date has been fixed for 2021 UTME registration. “Kindly disregard any tweet from a fake account that stated otherwise. The general public will be duly informed when the date is fixed. Thank you.”
