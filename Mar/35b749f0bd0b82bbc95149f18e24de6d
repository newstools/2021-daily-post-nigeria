According to Silva, Angel Di Maria, Kylian Mbappe, Didier Drogba, Roberto Firmino, Romario, Adriano, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Neymar, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are the ten strongest footballers he has played against. The 36-year-old, who has also played for Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan, said this on Thursday ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash with Leeds United on Saturday. “The ten strongest and most difficult players that I had the chance to play against are Di Maria, because of his technical quality and his incredible left foot,” Silva told Chelsea’s official website. “Kylian Mbappe, because of his speed and as well as his technical quality. “Didier Drogba, because of his physical strength and despite being incredibly strong, he still has a lot of technical skill. “Firmino, he is very intelligent in his movement that leaves defenders a bit lost. Romario, because of his intelligence in the box. “Adriano, like Drogba, is an incredible physical force with powerful left-foot. “Zlatan Ibrahimović, he was a black belt in martial arts before he became a footballer. “Neymar, because he has class, magic and intelligence. “Cristiano Ronaldo, because of his professionalism and dedication. “Messi because he has incredible quality and a God-given gift.”
