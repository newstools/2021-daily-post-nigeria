Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has warned Amad Diallo not to be carried away by his performance against AC Milan in the Europa League on Thursday. According to him, the young forward should know he still has ‘loads to learn’ after the 18-year-old’s goal helped Manchester United to a 1-1 draw with AC Milan on Thursday evening. United scored shortly after the half-time, but Simon Kjaer gave AC Milan a last-gasp equaliser. Although Solskjaer was full of praise for the youngster, he stressed that the former Atalanta player is still nowhere near the finished article. He said the player will need to work hard in order to cement his place in the United side. “It’s creative, he plays with freedom,” he said to BT Sport. “[It was a] great pass by Bruno who makes the goal. Amad, nice goal, [but] still loads to learn. He’ll be better after that.” The result leaves the Premier League giants with work to do in the return leg at the San Siro next week.
