Real Betis midfielder, Guido Rodriguez, has finally ruled out any possibility of joining Arsenal at the end of the season. Rodriquez said he is very happy at Real Betis after being linked with a move to Arsenal this summer. Reports had emerged earlier this week that Arsenal have prioritised a move for the 26-year-old as they are keen to recruit a new defensive midfielder to partner Thomas Partey in Mikel Arteta’s squad. Rodriquez, who has made a quick impact in LaLiga this season, only joined Real Betis from Mexican side, Club America, for €3 million last year. Reacting to the development, Rodriguez told Estadio Deportivo: “I saw it because friends from Argentina asked me, but I told them that I knew the same as them. “I am the protagonist because I am in the news, but today, I do not know more or less than you who also saw it. “I am very happy, I arrived and there was one or two months with a strange situation for everyone with the issue of confinement, but the truth is that I am very happy in Seville, with the city, the weather, at the club. I’m very happy. “It feels a bit strange when we walk down the street, I would have liked to experience all this with the fans in the stadium. I could only play a few games with the stadium full.”
