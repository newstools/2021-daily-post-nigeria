Tottenham Hotspur boss, Jose Mourinho, has named the players that will miss his side’s Europa League last-16 first-leg tie against Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday night in England. According to Mourinho, the players are Giovani Lo Celso and Joe Rodon. The former Chelsea and Manchester United manager said this on Wednesday during his pre-match press conference. Tottenham head to the game after beating Crystal Palace 4-1 in the Premier League last Sunday. “Gio is not ready, but it’s nothing to do with his previous big injury, that one is behind him,” Mourinho told Tottenham’s official website. “He was training normally with the team, just improving fitness levels, and now he has a back pain, which is nothing dramatic or to fear, but he’s stopped training in the last couple of days, so not yet.” Mourinho added: “Apart from Gio, Joe Rodon – the only player not selected because he is not in the UEFA list. Everybody is selected, and everybody is fit. Am I going to repeat the same team that played against Crystal Palace? No, I’m going to make a few changes.” The kick-off time for the match is 9 pm.
