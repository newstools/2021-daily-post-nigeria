Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, opted not to swap shirts with Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, following their 1-1 draw in the Champions League on Wednesday night. Mbappe had opened scoring from the penalty spot, before Messi fired in a stunning equalizer from long range. However, the result was not enough for Barca, who had lost the first leg 4-1 at the Camp Nou. After the game, Mbappe asked Barcelona youngster Pedri for his jersey. Pedri had played 78 minutes before he was replaced by Miralem Pjanic. But he made his way back onto the field after the game and was approached by Mbappe, who had already removed his PSG jersey. The duo hugged and spoke to each other for a few seconds before Mbappe asked the 18-year-old for his shirt. Pedri responded by unzipping his jacket and swapping tops with the Frenchman.
