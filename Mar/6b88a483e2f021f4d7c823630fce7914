Gunmen suspected to be bandits on Wednesday invaded the residence of the Commissioner for Youths and Sports Development in Sokoto State, Bashir Gorau. Gorau disclosed this on his verified Facebook account on Wednesday. He disclosed that the armed men abducted his sister-in-law and his brother. His post read, ”Innalillahi wa Inna wa innalillahi Rajiuun!!!. “It was about 12:45am, bandits attacked our House in Gorau Town, Goronyo local government area and abducted the wife of our elder brother Alhaji Lawali Gorau and one of our brothers, Hassan Manya. “May God protect and return them to us safely, Amin. We are in need of your prayers fellow Muslims.” He did not disclose if others were taken from the village. The attack on the politician’s family is another one out of many other attacks on residents in the northern region. The region has been faced with bandits’ attack and kidnapping under President Muhammadu Buhari administration. Calls have gone out from various quarters, especially from a Muslim cleric, Sheikh Gumi for the bandits to be granted amnesty but the presidency has rebuffed such requests, charging security agencies to restore security in affected areas.
