The Presidency has said that President Muhammadu Buhari did not embark on medical trip to the United Kingdom to treat any particular disease. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media Garba Shehu, who made the clarification while speaking on Channels TV programme on Tuesday, noted that there was no serious condition that prompted the President’s trip. “It is a medical trip and there is absolutely no urgency, no emergency; the President is not in any sick condition. “It is a routine medical check-up; the President has undertaken this with a set of doctors that he has retained over many years,” said Shehu who is the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity. Recall that the president, departed the Presidential Villa for the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja at about 2:30pm after which he proceeded to London for a routine medical check-up. The Presidency said the President, who met with the service chiefs before he travelled, was expected back in the country in the second week of April.
