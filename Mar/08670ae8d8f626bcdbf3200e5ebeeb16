Manchester United forward, Marcus Rashford, has not suffered ankle ligament damage, but is still expected to face a spell on the sidelines, the UK Telegraph reports. Rashford hobbled off the pitch in the 73rd minute of their 2-0 victory at Manchester City on Sunday. The 23-year-old ran back to challenge City winger Riyad Mahrez for the ball and there were fears he could have sustained ligament damage. However, he underwent a scan on Monday and it was confirmed that he has not suffered such extensive damage. His ankle ballooned with swelling bruising and he struggled to put weight on it on Monday. Rashford will ice it over the next couple of days and has surely emerged a major doubt for the first leg of Unitedâ€™s last-16 Europa League tie with AC Milan at Old Trafford on Thursday. They then face West Ham at home in the Premier League at the weekend.
