The armband flung on the ground by Portugal superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo, during his country’s 2-2 draw with Serbia on Saturday .has been put up for auction to save a sick child in Serbia. The Juventus superstar angrily threw his armband to the ground after the match officials refused his last-minute win against Serbia. Ronaldo’s disallowed goal left the match at 2-2 draw and one point each to both sides instead of all three for Portugal. The armband has now generated a lot of hope for the survival of the dying child after a stadium worker picked it and gave it to a children’s home to raise money, according to the Telegraf. The stadium worker was said to have picked up the armband from the ground and donated it to a children’s organisation, which was seeking funds for a six-month-old Serbian child with spinal muscular atrophy. The child needs €2.5 million for the operation and treatment. The children’s charity has now put the bracelet up for auction. According to the newspaper, the armband has already become a national record in regards to sporting equipment in the first few hours of it going up for auction. The Telegraf added that the armband reaching its €2.5 million target, appears not to be a problem.
