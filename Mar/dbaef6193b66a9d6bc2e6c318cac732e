Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has criticized the planned flag off of the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri rail lines by the federal government. Governor Wike, who spoke during the commissioning of the Rumuji-Ibaa-Obele-Isiokpo road in Emohua Local Government area of the state, said the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri rail lines is not the project that Rivers people want. The Governor also faulted the planned flag off of the Bonny Dip Sea Port, claiming that the government of President Muhammadu Buhari has no plans to complete the project. “Let them tell us what they have done for Rivers State. I hear they want to flag-off the rail line from here to Maiduguri. Is that what we need? “You want to build Bonny Seaport. This will be for how many years. Before the drawing would come out, has the government not left? They are only using those things as a bait to set a trap for you and you people will fall into it. We only have this year. Next year is political year. So tell them we cannot be deceived any longer,” Wike said. Meanwhile, the former Governor of Jigawa state Sule Lamido says the All Progressives Congress has not initiated and commissioned a single project over five years since it went over to the government at the federal level. Lamido, who was the Special Guest of Honor during the commissioning of the Rumuji-Ibaa-Obele-Isiokpo road in Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers state, said most of the projects being commissioned by the federal government were initiated by the last administration of the Peoples Democratic Party.
