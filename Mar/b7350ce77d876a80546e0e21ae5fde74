Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, on Saturday lamented that bandits have turned Kaduna State into their hub. Sani made the remark in response to the abduction of some members of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, in the State. Bandits were said to have abducted the RCCG Kaduna province members while on their way to Kafachan for evangelism on Friday evening. The RCCG bus was intercepted along Kachia – Kafachan road and all the passengers were taken to a bush by the kidnappers. Pastor Olaitan Olubiyi, the Head of Media and Public Relations of RCCG, confirmed the abduction. He did not release further details on the identities and number of the victims. Reacting, Sani lamented the mass abduction of Kaduna residents. In a tweet, the former lawmaker wrote: “The report of the Kidnapping of RCCG members along Kachia road in Kaduna is yet another tragedy. “Bandits have turned our state into their hub; before one kidnap is resolved, another one is unfolding. Humans have become preys. On entry you meet their snare, on exit you meet their ambush.”
