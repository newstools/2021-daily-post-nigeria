The All Progressives Congress (APC) has urged security agencies to reveal the enemies of Nigeria. APC commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the release of abducted schoolgirls in Zamfara. The party said the Buhari administration will stop at nothing to ensure the security and well-being of the people. John Akpan Udoedehe, APC National Secretary, in a statement, hailed stakeholders for their roles. He restated the President’s directive to subnational entities to provide adequate security in all schools within their areas of responsibility. “From Dapchi to Jangebe, the President Buhari government has time and again displayed its proactiveness and capacity to address the heinous abductions and ensure the quick and safe release of the students”, Udoedehe said. APC urged security services “to unmask the criminal sponsors and enemies of Nigeria behind the wave of targeted attacks on educational institutions in the country”.
The party advocated synergised operations and the use of modern technological tools to ensure better intelligence gathering, vigilance and surveillance.
