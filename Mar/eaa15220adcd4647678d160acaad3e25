Real Madrid left-back, Marcelo, faces a fine for breaking the travel restrictions currently in place to halt the spread of COVID-19. This was decided after the Valencian regional government confirmed it had started investigating the Brazilian international on Monday. The confirmation came shortly after Marcelo posted a photo of himself and his family at the Malvarrosa beach in Valencia on social media. The current travel restrictions prohibit a resident in Madrid to leave the Comunidad de Madrid. All entry in the Comunidad Valenciana from other parts of Spain is also forbidden. For the Real Madrid player to take a family photo at a beach in Valencia, he must have done both. Sources in the Valencian government have described Marceloâ€™s behaviour as showing a lack of solidarity and anti-social. According to the current regulations, fines for breaking travel restrictions range from 60 to 600 euros. Marcelo and his family also face another fine for not wearing face masks in the photo, and failure to wear a face mask outdoors is penalized with a fine of 100 euros.
