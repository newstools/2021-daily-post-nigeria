West Ham manager, David Moyes, has insisted he would only sell Declan Rice for more than £100m. Rice has been heavily linked with a move to Chelsea and Manchester United since last summer. And according to Moyes, the club does not need Champions League football next season to keep the 22-year-old. Hammers co-owner, David Sullivan, is understood to value Rice at around an eye-watering nine-figure sum. But Moyes said: “I don’t agree with the owners that Declan Rice is a £100m footballer. Far, far more than £100m. Far, far more “I look at the players who have joined some clubs from overseas and come in and nowhere near had the impact Declan Rice would have “I certainly wouldn’t put a price on it. You can decide which figure you want to put on it but I wouldn’t be sanctioning anything like that, that’s for sure.”
