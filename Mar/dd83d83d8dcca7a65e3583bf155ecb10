The Department of Petroleum Resources, DPR, in Kwara State, has intensified efforts towards curtailing the sale of gas products by unlicensed retailers in the State. The state coordinator of DPR, Sule Yusuf, disclosed this to DAILY POST in a telephone chat with our correspondent in Ilorin at the weekend. Asked if the Federal government’s directive on the sale of gas products by unlicensed persons was being complied with in the State, Yusuf said enlightenment campaign was ongoing to educate unlicensed and licensed retailers on how to go about the business of gas products. DAILY POST reports that there is indiscriminate sale of gas products by retailers in both residential and open areas in Ilorin the State capital, with attendant concern and consequences in case of emergencies. However, reacting to the development, Yusuf said the DPR was aware of the situation, hence, the campaign for the people, including retailers of the gas products to know the dangers in the business. “Gas retailers are very difficult to regulate and people are just risking their lives in the business which is a major concern to everybody. “We are doing the campaign with the state fire service to ensure that those without license are curtailed. “We are embarking on the campaign to ensure that those without license are licensed and secure suitable locations to conduct their businesses,” he added.
