Former Super Eagles midfielder, Sunday Oliseh, has hailed Kelechi Iheanacho and Wilfried Ndidi, for putting Nigeria’s name on the football map. Iheanacho scored twice as Leicester City beat Manchester United 3-1 in the FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday. The Nigerian forward, who was making his 15th start of the campaing, also set up another goal for Youri Tielemans. “Bravo 4 tonight, @Kelechi72 & @Ndidi25 are maybe on the way to bringing Nigeria back to Top club football, Makes me proud,” Oliseh tweeted. Iheanacho is now one of only two players, along with Sergio Aguero, to score 20 or more goals in England’s cup competitions over the last six years. He has bagged 12 goals in total and provided five assists in 28 appearances across all competitions this season, amid other dazzling displays.
