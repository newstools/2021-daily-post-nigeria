The Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly, Timothy Owoeye, has described the former Governor of Lagos State and the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a formidable political giant who has brought various changes to Nigerian politics. The Speaker in a congratulatory message by his Media Aide, Kunle Alabi and made available to DAILY POST stated that Tinubu is a leader of immeasurable value in Nigeria and Africa. Owoeye while stressing that the birthday of a true democrat and a bridge-builder is worth celebrating, noted that there is no denying the fact that Tinubu is a rare breed politician, patriot and a true democrat. He held that the accounts of modern Nigerian political evolution would not be complete without the recognition of the roles played by Tinubu. “Our country has gained a lot from your fountain of knowledge, wealth of experience, leadership acumen and political sagacity. “You have been a formidable force that has helped the country to put together a great political party that won power at the centre, you have shown that you are a true hero of our democracy. “On this occasion of your birthday, I and my colleagues at the Osun State House of Assembly join your immediate and political families in celebrating the abundant grace of God as you turn 69. “As you mark yet another year, my prayer for you is that God will continue to consolidate your efforts and crown them with outstanding success”.
