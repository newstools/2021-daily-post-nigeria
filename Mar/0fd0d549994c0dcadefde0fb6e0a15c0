A 43-year-old wife, Bisola Awodele, is in police custody for allegedly bathing her husband, Peter Phillips, with hot water, leaving him with grievous body injuries. The woman was arrested following a report by the husband at Sango-Ota Area Command on March 8. Philips was said to have run to the station with first degree burns on his body, reporting that his wife had “accused him of getting drunk after which she picked a pot containing already boiled water and emptied it on his body.” The Ogun State police image maker, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST on Sunday that the Area Commander, ACP Muhideen Obe, quickly ordered his JWC section to “effect the arrest of the murderous woman.” On interrogation, the suspect told the police that her husband was fond of coming home drunk, always without contributing anything to the welfare of her and the children. “She said on that fateful day, the husband came home drunk as usual and while she was complaining about his acts of drunkenness, the man started insulting her and her parents which infuriated her, consequent upon which she poured the hot water on his body,” According to Oyeyemi, a preliminary investigation had revealed that the woman, out of frustration, had killed a baby she gave birth to about eight months ago and secretly buried the body. DAILY POST learnt that the investigating team had since taken her to the secret grave of the baby, where the carcass was exhumed. The husband is reported to be recuperating at the General Hospital, Ota at the moment.
