Biafra Nations League, BNL, has asked Governor Nyesome Wike of Rivers State to commission other projects in the state and stop bragging about flyovers. The group said that the Rivers State Governor is making excess noise over the flyovers he is mounting all around Port Harcourt, the capital of Rivers State, abandoning other parts of the state. In a statement signed by Deputy National Leader of BNL, Ebuta Akor Takon, the group accused Wike of equating his flyover projects in the state with factories and industrial projects of other South South Governors. The group pointed out that development is beyond building flyovers, urging Wike to commission reasonable projects in the state and stop bragging over flyovers. The group further accused Wike of taking the glory for some of former governor Chibuike Amaechi’s projects, going to Abuja to demand for refund of money his predecessor used in building federal roads while in office. “The Governors of Delta and Cross River are transforming their states without noise,” the group said, wondering why “Wike wants to be appearing in the news everyday.” BNL further slammed Wike for boasting to be a powerful politician. “He is not among the 20 strongmen in Rivers State, he knows that, he is just paying for reports to be appearing in the news everyday,” BNL said.
