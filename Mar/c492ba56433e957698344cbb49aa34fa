The Governor while welcoming Burna Boy and his parents on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Port Harcourt described the Grammy award-winning Afrobeat singer, as the pride of the state. The governor also encouraged Burna Boy to continue making the state proud even as he promised to do anything to promote him. Speaking during the end of the event, the Governor also promised to give artistes who performed at Burna’s Homecoming Concert in Rivers State N10 million each. “I’m not here for politics today, I’m here for the youths. “It gladdens my heart to know that regardless of how the situation of the country is, our youths are still making us proud globally. “I always love to support young talents because it’s not easy to keep pursuing what you love to do especially when your government does little or nothing to show their support or appreciation. “However, Burnaboy and so many other artists have been putting in their best to their career to ensure that we keep going globally and because of this I will be giving him a land in Old GRA, Port Harcourt and money to build. “I will also be supporting any other artistes who performed at this Homecoming Concert with N10 million each,” he said.
