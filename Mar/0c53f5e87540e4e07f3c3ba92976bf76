Governor Seyi Makinde has maintained that Oyo State will not provide free lands for herders because ranching is a private business. Makinde made the clarifications in a tweet, following reports that there will be free lands for ranching in the state. He insisted that his administration will only implement plans that are beneficial to the state. “My attention has been drawn to this tweet regarding the implementation of the National Livestock Transformation Plan during the joint security meeting, yesterday. For the avoidance of doubt, when I said we would implement the plan, I didn’t mean a wholesale implementation. “We will be taking aspects which are beneficial for our state. As I have stated on several occasions, our position in Oyo State is that ranching is a private business and should be carried out as such. Our admin won’t be providing land for free to private investors for ranching.”
