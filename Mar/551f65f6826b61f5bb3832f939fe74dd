Speaker of the Oyo State House of Assembly, Adebo Ogundoyin has said that the forum of speakers of state Houses of Assembly will not relent until the financial autonomy is given to state assemblies. DAILY POST recalls that the financial autonomy bill was passed into law in 2018 and assented to with a Presidential Order 10 by President Muhammadu Buhari. It was, however, gathered that the law is yet to be implemented among the states across the country. The speaker of Oyo State House of Assembly, Ogundoyin has, however, noted that he has his colleagues will not relent until the law is implemented. He spoke on Tuesday while addressing members of Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria who began an indefinite strike. Ogundoyin added he and his colleagues are in support of the call by the association for the implementation of financial autonomy for the legislative arm of government. He said the strike will no doubt paralyse the activities of the Oyo State House of Assembly. Ogundoyin maintained that the strike is in the interest of democracy and the independence of the legislative arms of government. He assured the protesting workers that the Governors Forum will soon come up with a uniform way or modality of implementing financial autonomy. “No state will go about it in a different way. Everything will be done in a uniform manner. “Let me also say that the speakers’ forum too will not relent until the financial autonomy is achieved.” Chairman of the association, Mr Yemi Alade said the financial autonomy bill was passed into law in 2018 and assented to with a Presidential Order 10 by President Muhammadu Buhari and wondered why the implementation has not commenced. “Our appeal is to all the Governors to commence the implementation of financial autonomy. “It is surprising that they are not following the Presidential Order. We will not return to work until our demands are met.”
