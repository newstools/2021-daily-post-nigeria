The Clerk of the Ondo State House of Assembly, Bode Adeyelu and a member of the Assembly, Bankole Felemugudu, have been detained by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC). The two were alleged to have been detained over accusations of fraud in the Assembly. It was gathered that before their detention, they were invited by the anti-graft agency for an interview over a fraud allegedly committed in 2019. According to sources at the Assembly, the EFCC invitation was honoured last week after which they were subsequently detained following a series of interrogation. The source said, “It is true. The Clerk of the House and Hon. Felemugudu Bankole along with two civil servants in the Assembly are there in the EFCC’s custody. They were detained there. “Based on that invitation, all of them went there and they were detained last Thursday. I think the EFCC must have commenced an investigation into their matter.” When contacted over the development, the spokesman of the Assembly, Gbenga Omole who declined to comment on the matter said, “I am not answering any question, I am going to address the press tomorrow, (Monday),”
