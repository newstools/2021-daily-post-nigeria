Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has confirmed Ahmed Musa will not feature in either of their final Africa Cup of Nations qualifying matches against Benin Republic and Lesotho. Musa is still clubless, after leaving Saudi Professional League club Al Nassr in October 2020. The winger has not played a competitive match since he featured in Nigeria’s 4-4 draw against Sierra Leone on November 13. Musa’s latest invitation to the squad raised eyebrows, but Rohr has explained he is in camp to train and keep his fitness level. “Musa is our captain, and he is a part of the team though he won’t play because he has not been active, but we want to assist him to train and he will also help our team as we prepare for these two important matches,” Rohr told the CAF website.
