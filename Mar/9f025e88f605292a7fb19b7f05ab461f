The wife of a pastor in the Adamawa State capital, Yola, has dragged her husband to court over allegations of sleeping with women right inside his church. Mrs Jumai Mala, the wife of Pastor Yakubu Kefas Ayuba of Heavengate Bible Mission in Bachure, Yola North Local Government Area, is insisting that Pastor Ayuba sleeps with women inside the church. Mrs Jummai alleged that she had caught her husband in the act a number of times. She said that her husband has a bed in the office of the church which he uses to commit adultery. The Pastors wife told the Upper Area Court III in Yola that her husband had continued in the act and she could not remain his wife. She asked the court to dissolve the marriage as her husband had long proved that he could not stop chasing women, as efforts she made to advise him had only attracted threats of violence against her. She said her marriage is blessed with four children but that unfortunately, the responsibility for the children was hers as he gives nothing for their upbringing. Pastor Ayuba, however, dismissed the allegations, claiming that his wife was lying to the court. The pastor had, through his counsel, F. R. Baiyo, called three witnesses who testified in court and were cross-examined by counsel to the petitioner, J. J. Shalli. The Upper Area Court III in Yola presided over by Hon Umar Isa, adjourned the case to later in the month, March 10, for further hearing.
