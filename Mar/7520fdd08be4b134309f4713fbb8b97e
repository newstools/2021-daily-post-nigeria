Former Manchester United star, David Beckham, has backed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after the manager received a sack warning following the club’s exit from the FA Cup last weekend. Solskjaer drew heavy criticism after Man United were knocked out from the FA Cup by Leicester City on Sunday. But Beckham, a former Man United’s teammate with Solskjaer, insisted that the Red Devils boss is doing “an incredible job” at Old Trafford. “You know, I have seen some of the criticism,” Beckham told ESPN. “But I suppose when you are a manager at Manchester United and when Manchester United have had the success over the years that they have had, there was always going to be a point where people get criticised – whether it is players, whether it is owners, whether it is the manager. “Ole has been in the game for long enough to be able to take any kind of criticism. He is very quiet, he gets on with his job, and I think he is done an incredible job down at United. “The results are starting to show that, so hopefully that continues because the fans love Ole, we all love Ole, and we all want him to do well. “So when that criticism comes, he’s one person that can take it.” Man United’s next game is against Brighton on April 4 after the international break.
