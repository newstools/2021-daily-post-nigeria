Juventus’ third-choice goalkeeper, Carlo Pinsoglio, has wondered why Cristiano Ronaldo does not score free-kicks during games, insisting that the Portuguese superstar “scores them all the time” in training. Ronaldo is surprisingly having a poor record in putting free-kicks behind the net and Pinsoglio believes it is a mere “bad luck.” Ronaldo has scored just one in over 72 set-pieces he has taken during his time with the Serie A title holders. The Portuguese superstar displayed his sporadic showings over free-kicks in the colours of Manchester United, Real Madrid and Portugal, but has been criticised for not being able to give Juventus fans some of those feelings. However, the Juve’s third-choice keeper told Tuttosport that “Cristiano always takes free kicks in training and he scores them all the time. “I don’t know why he can’t do it in games, maybe it’s just bad luck. “I have a beautiful friendship with him, my team-mates make fun of me saying that I’ll go to the Euros with the Portugal staff and Cristiano. “Ronaldo is a simple guy, not a star, he’s quiet, he likes to laugh and joke.”
