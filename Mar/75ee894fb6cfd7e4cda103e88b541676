The Police in Osun State has arrested a man identified as Kazeem Olapade for allegedly having carnal knowledge of his 13-year-old biological daughter. The suspect was said to have started the unlawful act since the COVID-19 lockdown ordered by the government last year. Kazeem’s wife, Mrs Basirat Ismail was said to have reported the suspected incest to a Non-Governmental Organisation, Monsurat Ajoke Foundation and the headquarters of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, Osogbo. The matter was brought to the notice of the Osun Ministry of Children, Women and Social Affairs last week, according to the Principal Social Welfare Officer in charge of the ministry in Ede Zone, Mrs Dorcas Lawrence. Lawrence said the case was later reported at the State Criminal Investigation Department by the ministry before the suspect was arrested. It was gathered that the victim’s mother had married the suspect in 2006 before their separation in 2009. Basirat married another man afterwards but left her two daughters in the custody of their father (Olapade) after their separation. Basirat was said to have visited her daughters at the house of her estranged husband in Ido-Osun in February and discovered that her younger daughter, aged 13, was not walking properly. She was said to have queried her before her elder daughter revealed that their father had been molesting her sexually since the COVID-19 lockdown began. Olapade was later arrested by the Police in his house at Ido-Osun, Egbedore Local Government Area of the state. Meanwhile, the state government, through its Commissioner for Women, Children and Social Affairs, Barr. Olubukola Olaboopo has affirmed that no rapist would go unpunished adding that they would face the full wrath of the law.
