Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, will sign a new £9million/year contract at the club, the UK Mirror reports. The Norwegian’s current three-year deal enters its final year later this month. Even before United’s 2-0 win over Manchester City last weekend, United’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward publicly praised the steps made under Solskjaer to shareholders. Solskjaer’s reward will be an upward review of his current £7 million-a-year salary. Woodward believes Solskjaer has restored the club’s DNA missing under previous bosses, Jose Mourinho and Louis Van Gaal, with an emphasis on emerging young talent and attacking football. Although United are yet to win a trophy under the 48-year-old after losing three cup semi-finals last season, Woodward and American owners, as the Glazers have seen enough to be encouraged as the squad are on the right track to success. The Red Devils are second behind City in the Premier League and could still win a trophy in the FA Cup or Europa League.
