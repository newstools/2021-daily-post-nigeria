Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, has said the people of the Southwest are determined to actualise Yoruba nation. Igboho declared that the time was right to actualise the much-desired Yoruba nation. The freedom fighter, in a statement by his spokesman, Olayomi Koiki, stressed that there was no going back on the push to actualise the Yoruba nation. The statement partly read: “Anyone willing to support the agitation for the Yoruba nation is highly welcomed; the goal is the Yoruba nation now. “We know what we want and are not going back. Every other side talk is nothing but a distraction. We are fully focused; the Yoruba nation is the goal. “Let me reiterate, anything you did not hear from me, Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho) or my spokesperson, Olayomi Koiki of Koiki Media, is not a fact.” Igboho has been advocating for the expulsion of killer herdsmen from the Southwest. Amid his calls for killer herdsmen to leave the Southwest, a combined team of the Department of State Services, DSS, and the police had allegedly attempted to arrest him. The attempt was made along the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, a few weeks ago. DSS, however, denied involvement in the attempted arrest.
