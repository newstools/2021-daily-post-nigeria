Zimbabwe Vice President Kembo Mohadi on Monday resigned following sexual allegation. Zimbabwe media service ZimLive had earlier reported that Mohadi allegedly had improper sexual liaisons with married women, including one of his subordinates. Mohadi, however, denied the accusations describing it as a political plot against him. He accused his political enemies of “hacking and cloning” his phone. In a statement released by the Ministry of Information on Monday, Mohadi Asia’s he resigned in order to have more time to deal with his political enemies and prove his innocence. The former Vice President stated that his resignation is not a matter of cowardice “but a sign of him demonstrating great respect to the office of the President”. Part of the statement read: “ Following the recurring disinformation and virilisation of my alleged immoral unions, dispensed through awkward slacktivism, I am stepping down as the vice president of the Republic of Zimbabwe with immediate effect. “I’ve been going through a soul-searching pilgrimage and realised that I need the space to deal with my problem outside the governance chair,.” He thanked President Mnangagwa for the “opportunity to serve under him for the past three years. “My resignation is also necessitated by my desire to seek clarity and justice on the matter in which my legal team will pursue and deconstruct this pseudo paparazzi and flawed espionage to achieve cheap political points. “I promise to poke holes in this grand strategy by political foes,” the statement added.
