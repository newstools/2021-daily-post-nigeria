Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has said his team has a score to settle with Crystal Palace when both sides clash in the Premier League on Wednesday night at Selhurst Park. Crystal Palace defeated Man United, 3-1 at Old Trafford in the reverse fixture last September. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday, Solskjaer said, “You could say patience but also you need the quality because he [Roy Hodgson] has a great record of organising his teams. “They have some very experienced players that know the game. We felt that early on in the first game of the season, of course. “They counter attacked a few times against us and scored. So we have got a score to settle, to be honest.” Man United heads to the game after playing a 0-0 draw against Chelsea last weekend. The Kick-off time for the match is 9:15 pm.
