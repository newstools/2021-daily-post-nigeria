Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has suspended the teachers recruitment exercise. The governor directed the Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM) to refund payments made by the candidates. The money was for the purchase of the Teaching Service Manual, Service Record and Job Cards during the documentation stage. Babatunde Abegunde, TESCOM Chairman, noted that Fayemi did not want to make new entrants in the public service to suffer. Abegunde said the government was fair in the recruitment exercise, but the COVID-pandemic and the EndSARS protest affected the stateâ€™s economy. He explained that as things stand, the government might not be able to promptly pay salaries of new recruits Abegunde assured that the process would continue as soon as the state finances improved.
