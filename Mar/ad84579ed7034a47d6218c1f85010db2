Chelsea winger, Christian Pulisic, has been told to leave the club and join Liverpool. The American international has struggled to earn a regular role at Chelsea under Thomas Tuchel. Former United States international Brad Friedel, told the former Borussia Dortmund star that a move to Liverpool this summer could be “ideal”. Pulisic has started just 10 Premier League games this season and faces fierce competition from Hakim Ziyech, Kai Havertz and Timo Werner. And this situation has led to suggestions that a switch to Liverpool could be made in the next transfer window. Friedel, a USMNT legend, who had a spell at Liverpool during his playing days, told CardsChat on the speculation surrounding his fellow American: “I think Liverpool’s system is a good one for Christian, without a doubt. “He’s very quick, his first steps are quick and even when he gets going, he’s very quick. The pressing style that Jurgen Klopp likes to play under, then the quick counter-attack and the runs through the lines, I think he would be able to perform very well in that system. “Again, I have no idea if that’s a player that they’re looking at, but that type of system would be ideal for someone like Christian. “He is our [America] best attacking player, and we’ve got a few of them. We need him to stay injury free, that’s for sure.”
