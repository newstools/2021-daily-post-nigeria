Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, said bandits terrorizing the state will be defeated. He gave the assurance on Wednesday during a visit by the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amoo. The governor said his administration would not allow bandits to disrupt the education system. He commended security agencies for their battle against banditry and insurgency in Nigeria. “We are confident that we shall win the fight against banditry, we are sure that our schools will remain functional,” NAN quoted him as saying. El-Rufai recalled the agreement of a stakeholders meeting held on Tuesday. In attendance were government officials, heads of security agencies, civil society and religious groups. “We agreed that only the most vulnerable schools should be shut down, because they cannot be easily accessed due to the terrain of their location,” he said. Amao disclosed that his visit was to assess the preparedness of the Air Training Command, whose personnel are fighting the bandits in the North-West. Just yesterday, the governor had declared that his government will not negotiate with bandits.
