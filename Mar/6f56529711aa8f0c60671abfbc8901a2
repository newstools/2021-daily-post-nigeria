Former Liverpool midfielder, Danny Murphy, has warned Ole Gunnar Solskjaer he could be sacked as Manchester United, if he doesn’t win a trophy this season. Solskjaer watched on as the Red Devils crashed out of the FA Cup on Sunday, thanks to a 3-1 defeat at Leicester City. United have already been knocked out of the Champions League in the group stages this season and the Carabao Cup semi-finals by rivals Manchester City. Murphy now feels Solskjaer keeping his job, might depend on him winning the Europa League. “They can’t be blaming tiredness for a loss at Leicester in the FA Cup and their squad not being strong enough,” Murphy told talkSPORT . “United competing in the Europa League is not good enough, first and foremost, the fans know that, the club know that and Ole knows that. “Not progressing in the Champions League was a massive, massive blow for them. Yes, they’re going to get in the top four… but so they damn should! “He’s in a position for me where the Europa League, for me, has become monumental for him and the club.”
