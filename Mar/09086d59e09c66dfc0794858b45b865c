Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, on Wednesday, accused the Federal Government of Nigeria of shielding the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, from prosecution for purportedly misappropriating proceeds from the sales of some of the state’s assets. Wike said it was awful that the FG had continued to protect the minister from prosecution for his alleged inability to account for $308million from the sales of the state-owned power plant and other critical assets when he was Rivers Governor. The governor spoke during the inauguration of 6.1km long, 7.3m wide Omuihuechi-Omuoko-Omokiri link Road in Aluu Ikwerre Local Government Area. This was disclosed in a statement signed by Kelvin Ebiri, Wike’s Special Assistant on Media. Wike said: “People gave you an opportunity. You sold our properties, everything. And people are talking in this state because of the government that says they are fighting corruption and protecting people. “You (Amaechi) sold our property for $308million and kept for us $208,000. That is the kind of people parading themselves in government, for a government that says they are fighting corruption, shame.” DAILY POST recalls that this is coming less than 24hours after Amaechi said Wike did not speak based on facts when he condemned the planned construction of the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri rail line and the Bonny Seaport.
