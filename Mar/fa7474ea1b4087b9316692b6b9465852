Operatives of the Bayelsa State Police Command has paraded forty-two suspected criminals, for various criminal offences and recovered a cache of arms, ammunition and stolen items as exhibits from them. The State Commissioner of Police, CP Mike Okoli, on Wednesday in Yenagoa, said the suspects paraded were mainly armed robbers, murderers, thieves and cultists. According to him”These achievements were possible within few weeks due to the synergy between the police command, other security agencies in the state and the willingness of members of the public to volunteer useful information to the police”. Armed robbers masquerading as Government Task Force who robbed unsuspecting members of the public of money and other valuables, were paraded and the locally made pistols used in their operations were also showcased. Others paraded were five thieves who stole four hundred and forty-four (444) mattresses meant for flood-displaced victims in the state. One Lazarus Josiah narrated how he strangled his mother to death on suspicion of witchcraft. Similarly, Christopher Chiabata ‘m’ 56 years narrated how he attempted to commit suicide when he killed his wife with pestle over a minor domestic quarrel. DAILY POST gathered that all the suspects will be charged to court at the conclusion of the investigation.
