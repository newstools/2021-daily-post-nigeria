Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has said that the 2023 general election may be sabotaged by insecurity if it is not tacked before the election time. Ortom made the assertion on Tuesday while briefing State House correspondents shortly after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The governor was at the Villa to brief the president on the state of security in his state. Ortom who lamented the level of insecurity currently ravaging the country stated that “there will be no 2023 elections in Nigeria if insecurity persists”. The governor insisted that he had done nothing wrong in enacting an anti-open grazing law beneficial to the state. He added that demands by the cattle breeders association, Miyetti Allah to repel the law would be impossible to fulfil because it went through due process, hence the matter is clearly beyond him. Governor Ortom who lauded his counterparts who have reacted to the attack on him prayed that no one experiences what happened to him. Recall that the governor was attacked last week by gunmen suspected to be herdsmen while in his farm along Gboko – Makurdi road.
