Alvaro Morata has revealed he “came close” to suffering from depression during his time at Chelsea. The Blues paid a then club-record £58 million fee to sign Morata from Real Madrid in 2017. However, the striker struggled at Stamford Bridge, despite scoring 24 goals in 72 games. Morata left Chelsea for Atletico Madrid in January 2019, before joining former club, Juventus prior to the current campaign. “I’ve never had depression and I hope I never do, but I came close,” Morata said in an interview with El Mundo. “When your head doesn’t work well, you are your worst enemy. During those times, it doesn’t matter what you do, you are always fighting against yourself. Depression is an illness just like breaking your ankle.”
