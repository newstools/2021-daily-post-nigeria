The House of Representatives on Tuesday expressed worry over the Thursday deadline given by Boko Haram insurgents to execute Pastor Bulus Yikura who has been in their custody. The House called on the Federal Government to ensure that the pastor is rescued before the deadline expires. The green chamber made the call following an urgent motion moved by the lawmaker representing Chibok/Damboa/Gwoza Federal Constituency in Borno State, Mr Ahmad Jaha. Moving the motion, Jaha said, “The House is worried by the continuous closing of the one-week period given by the insurgents, which expires on Thursday, March 4, 2021. “The House is concerned that at the expiration of the deadline, anything can happen to Pastor Bullus Yikura.” The motion of urgent public importance was moved at the plenary on Tuesday and was unanimously adopted by the House. The House, therefore, resolved to, “intimate the Federal Government to do everything possible to secure the release of the victim before the deadline.” The leader of the insurgents, Abubakar Shekau, had on February 24, 2021, issued a seven day ultimatum to the Federal Government to secure the release of Yikura, who was abducted in December 2020. However, it was unclear if the Boko Haram leader had made any demand before issuing the deadline.
