Former Chelsea midfielder, Oscar, has revealed his plans to return to Stamford Bridge to ‘finish’ off his career. The Brazilian left Chelsea in 2017 to join Chinese side, Shanghai SIPG, in a £60m deal that has seen him earn £400,000-a-week salary for the last four years. However, the 29-year-old is keen to return to the West London club that helped him win two English Premier League titles, the League Cup and the UEFA Europa League. “I think about finishing at Chelsea because I had good times before at Chelsea,” Oscar told talkSPORT. “Chelsea helped me a lot to improve and to do what I always dreamed [of], which was to play in the Champions League, and they helped me to play in the World Cup and to win the Premier League. “I’ve a lot of friends at Chelsea. If I’ve a chance to finish my career at Chelsea, it is a dream for me. Of course, Chelsea does not like to buy too many older players, which is normal because it is a top team from Europe, but I’ll try my best to be fit to finish there.” Oscar netted 38 goals in 203 appearances for Chelsea after arriving from Brazilian side Internacional in 2012 in a deal worth around £20m.
