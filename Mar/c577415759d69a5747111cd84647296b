The presidency has suggested that influential persons were engaging in illicit trade in Zamfara State. The government said jets were used to transport arms to bandits and move gold illegally out of Nigeria. Garba Shehu, presidential spokesperson, told BBC Hausa these were part of the reasons a no-fly zone was declared. “Jets are being used to pick up gold mined in some parts of Zamfara and exported. “There is a Nigerian gold market in Dubai. The government is losing, the people of this country are losing”, he said. On Tuesday, National Security Adviser, Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd) announced the ban on non-military aerial movement in Zamfara. There is also a ban on all mining activities in the North-West state. Buhari ordered massive deployment of military assets to restore normalcy. The state faces a serious banditry challenge. Hundreds have been kidnapped and scores killed in 2021 alone.
