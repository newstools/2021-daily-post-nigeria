Former House of Representatives Speaker, Dimeji Bankole, is on his way to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Ogun-born politician met with Yobe Governor and Chairman APC Caretaker Committee, Mai Mala Buni, on Friday. Also at the meeting was Jigawa Governor, Abubakar Badaru. The trio discussed a wide range of political issues, including the entry of the former Speaker and his supporters into the party. The APC is strengthening its grip in Ogun State. The ruling platform witnessed a split before the 2019 general elections. During the grand rally for President Muhammadu Buhari’s in the state, Bola Tinubu, APC National Leader, spoke angrily to ex-Governor Amosun as the crowd became unruly. Amosun openly supported the governorship candidate of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM), Adekunle Akinlade against APC’s Dapo Abiodun. This caused tension at the venue. Akinlade, his protégé, was the House of Representatives member for Egbado South and Ipokia Federal Constituency. Amosun had directed supporters to ensure the success of the APM at the governorship election after Governor Abiodun beat Akinlade to win the APC ticket. Abiodun reached out to prominent indigenes, including former Governor Gbenga Daniel. At the polls, he defeated Akinlade and late Buruji Kashamu of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Last month, Daniel, who was the Deputy Director-General of the Atiku Abubakar 2019 presidential campaign, defected to the APC.
