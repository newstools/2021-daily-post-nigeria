President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the new Tanzanian President, Samia Suluhu Hassan. Haasan, the former VP, was sworn in on Friday following the death of President John Magufuli. In a message to the first ever female president of the country, Buhari urged Hassan to unite the nation and lead the country in a good direction. The President expressed his desire to work with the new leader “to advance issues of common African and global interests”. Hassan, 61, is expected to finish Magufuli’s second five-year term in 2025. She promised to continue “the legacy of patriotism to the African course which the late Magufuli laid down”.
