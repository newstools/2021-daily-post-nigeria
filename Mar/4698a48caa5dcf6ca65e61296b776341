Expatriates kidnapped in Gabon and Nigerian negotiators held captive have been rescued. They were freed on Saturday in Tombia, a creek in Bille waterways, Degema Local Government Area of Rivers State. The victims included six Chinese, three Indonesians, one Gabonese and four Nigerians that had gone to facilitate their release. Men of the 29 Battalion, Nigeria Army with support from local vigilante, took part in the operation. Commanding Officer, 29 Battalion, Lt. Col. Mohammed Yahaya, spoke to reporters at the 6 Division, Nigeria Army, Bori Camp in Port Harcourt.  The officer disclosed that a ransom of $300,000 was paid before the military intervened. “As they were about bringing them out of the creeks, they had issues that made them even susceptible to kidnapping again. “Men of the 29 Battalion, under the 6 Division, in conjunction with local vigilantes launched an operation and were able to rescue them. “They have a trolley, Socipeg, registered in Gabon. It was in the course of their fishing activities that they were kidnapped,” Yahaya said. All the former hostages were handed over to the Department of State Services (DSS). The agency will carry out further investigation.
