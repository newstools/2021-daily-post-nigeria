Indigenes of Onitsha in Anambra State have floated a security outfit known as Onitsha Ado Vigilante Network to check the increasing wave of crime in the commercial city. The traditional ruler of Onitsha Kingdom, Obi Alfred Achebe, who unveiled the security outfit over the weekend, said there was need to keep the security of the city, especially being a commercial hub. The monarch also unveiled branded Toyota Sienna vehicles said to have been donated by good spirited individuals in the city for the fight against insecurity. Onitsha has lately fallen for criminals and hoodlums who dispose visitors and residents alike of their belongings, even in broad daylight. Meanwhile, the Anambra State command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has protested the choice of colour for the branding of the vehicles donated for the Onitsha Ado Vigilante Network. The NSCDC said the colour conflicted with theirs, while urging the Vigilante Network to immediately repaint all their vehicles to avoid clash of interest. A press release by the
State Commandant of NSCDC Anambra State Command, Comdt David Bille said, “The attention of the Anambra State Command of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC has been drawn to the crested vehicles painted in Civil Defence Colours presented to Onitsha Ado Vigilante Network. “The corps while appreciating the Onitsha community for taking a bold step in complimenting the functions of federal security agencies in the fight against crimes and criminality in the state, urges the community to as a matter of urgency effect a change of colours on the said vehicles to avoid clash of interest.” The Commandant wondered why the initiators of the said vigilante network could not have known that white, red and black colours are being used by the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, before unveiling the same colours to the Public.
