Gunmen have kidnapped Rev. Fr. Harrison Prhinyovaw, the Priest in charge of St. John’s Catholic Church, Obinomba, in Ukwuani Local Government Area of Delta. He was taken at about 8:00 p.m. on Monday in Abraka, Ethiope East Local Government Area. NAN reports that Prhinyovaw was in transit from Warri to Obinomba. The cleric was navigating through a bad spot in his Highlander SUV in Oria-Abraka when the incident happened. “The kidnappers shot sporadically in the air to scare away passers-by. They abandoned the cleric’s car at the scene”, a source said. A vigilance group member disclosed he and his colleagues heard the gun shots fired by the kidnappers. The vigilante said they could not face the attackers with their “shoot and run” guns. Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Delta, Edafe Bright, confirmed the incident. The spokesman added that a crack team of the police was on trail of the assailants.
