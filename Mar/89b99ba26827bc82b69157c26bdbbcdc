The Minister of Transportation and Leader of the All Progressives Congress in the South-South, Rotimi Amaechi has revalidated his membership of the APC. Amaechi revalidated his membership of the party alongside his wife, Judith, at Ubima Community, Unit 14, Ward 8 in Ikwerre LGA of Rivers State. The Ministerâ€™s revalidation exercise comes days after the Supreme Court removed all the legal impediments that almost destroyed the APC in Rivers State. The party which was sharply fictionalised in Rivers State had two leaderships; the one led by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and another, by former Senator, Magnus Abe. While some factional members of the APC; Igo Aguma and Livingston Wechie has resigned from the party, Senator Abe has encouraged other aggrieved members to seek other political options in meeting their aspirations. However, Amaechi in the company APC leaders including the Chairman Board of NIMASA, Asita Honourable, arrived in Port Harcourt on Monday and headed to his home town, Ubima for the exercise.
