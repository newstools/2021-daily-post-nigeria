An Ilorin priest, Abdurasak Al-Sulati, popularly called Kewulere, has been charged for allegedly killing one Sumo Usman. He was arraigned at an Ilorin Magistrates’ Court on Friday on a two-count charge of criminal conspiracy and culpable homicide contrary to Sections 97 and 221 of Penal Code Law. In the Police First Information Report (FIR), the defendant allegedly conspired with Sheidu Mumini, Isiaka Dauda and Suleiman Usman to commit murder. The quartet were said to have cut off Usman’s head and hands for a money ritual. The prosecuting counsel, Issa Abubakar, said the investigation is ongoing and requested the remand of Kewulere in custody. The police officer told the court that the offences against the accused are not ordinarily bailable. The defence counsel, Adam Abdulrahman, insisted that the allegations were yet to be substantiated with facts. Magistrate Afusat Alege ruled that the defendant be kept in Oke-kura Correctional Centre, Ilorin, and adjourned until March 29.
