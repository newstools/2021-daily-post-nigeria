Kano State Hisbah has arrested two young men accused of sending pornographic materials to a married woman. A statement issued by the spokesman, Lawan Ibrahim, said the suspects were traced and arrested after the woman lodged a complaint. The complainant said she did not know persons sending the messages to her phone. Hisbah Commander-General, Harun Ibn-Sina, ordered a full investigation into the matter. The board collected the phone numbers which led to the arrest of the duo at Unguwa Uku in Tarauni Local Government Area. The suspects are aged 20 and 21. “We have summoned their parents to speak with them and for them to pay keen attention to their wards’ way of life to avoid such behaviour in future,” Ibrahim noted
