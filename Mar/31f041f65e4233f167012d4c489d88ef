Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has given an update on his squad ahead of their Premier League clash with David Moyes’s West Ham United on Sunday evening. Solskjaer said that Paul Pogba, Juan Mata and Donny van de Beek will miss Man United’s clash against West Ham at Old Trafford. The Red Devils manager stated this during his pre-match press conference on Friday. Man United head to the game following a 1-1 draw with AC Milan in the Europa League round of 16 first-leg tie on Thursday. “No, I don’t think any of those [Paul, Mata and Donny]will be available,” Solskjaer told reporters. “We hope maybe before the international break. Maybe, but I am not sure. “It is taking a little bit longer than we expected, but we have three games now and then the international break, and after that, they will all be available for us.” Solskjaer also confirmed that goalkeeper, David De Gea, is back in Manchester after returning to Spain for the birth of his first child. De Gea has sat out each of Man United’s last three fixtures, with Dean Henderson replacing him and keeping two clean sheets. The kick-off time for Man United vs West Ham is 8:15 pm.
