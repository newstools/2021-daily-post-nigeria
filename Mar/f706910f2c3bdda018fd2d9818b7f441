Manchester United midfielder, Fred, was the target of racist trolls on social media, following their 3-1 defeat at Leicester City on Sunday. Fred’s error led to Kelechi Iheanacho making it 1-0 for the hosts. The Brazilian was then brushed aside by Youri Tielemans, who made it 2-1 after Mason Greenwood equalized for United. After the game, Fred’s Instagram account was filled with comments racial in nature. The Brazil international is one of several United players to be subjected to abuse in recent weeks. Marcus Rashford posted a statement about comments directed at him in late January, while Anthony Martial and Axel Tuanzebe were also targeted. Manchester United have previously condemned abuse directed at their players by “mindless idiots”.
