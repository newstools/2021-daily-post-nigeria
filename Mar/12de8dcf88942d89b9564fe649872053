Thomas Tuchel has said that he regrets his decisions of not playing Olivier Giroud in recent matches. The German tactician said that the Frenchman has suffered in the last four games and that he (Tuchel) is not happy with his own decisions. Chelsea face Sheffield United in the FA Cup quarter-final clash at the weekend. The last time Giroud played was when he scored a stunning acrobatic volley away at Atlético Madrid in the first leg of the Blues Champions League last 16. However, the 34-year-old will be hoping for a rare start under Tuchel in the FA Cup, a competition he has won four times. “He [Giroud] can have a huge impact in our team because he has the experience, the physical presence and ruthlessness in the box,” Tuchel told reporters. “That is his style of football. He has suffered in the last four games a bit, and I am not so happy with my decisions against Southampton and Leeds. “After the game, I had the feeling they were games that he should have had 20, 25 minutes to help us win rather than a draw. So it’s clearly my fault.”
