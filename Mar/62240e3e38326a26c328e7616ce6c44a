Super Eagles goalkeeper, Maduka Okoye, has said they will go all out for the maximum points, when they take on Benin Republic and Lesotho in their final 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. Okoye manned the posts, when Nigeria threw away a four-goal lead to draw 4-4 against Sierra Leone in Benin City last November. He then kept a clean sheet during the second leg which ended 0-0 four days later in Freetown. “I’m looking forward to the game because I’m always honoured to represent my country and I’m trying to help the team and to get the win of course. “We can understand the disappointment from the last two matches against Sierra Leone, but we are going to work hard to six points in those two games,” Okoye told journalists on Tuesday. Nigeria play Benin Republic this Saturday in Porto Novo, before hosting Lesotho three days later.
