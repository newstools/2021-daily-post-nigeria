The Minister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Amaechi has said women should be given a chance to handle more political appointments than men. The former Governor of Rivers State said this while speaking at the second edition of the Association of Nigerian Women Business Network (ANWBN) in Abuja. The Minister noted that women are far more intelligent than men and are capable of holding positions of authority in society. “I do not support male domination, neither do I support female domination. I believe that all of you seated here are qualified to rule this nation. “I don’t believe that a particular seat should be set aside for a woman, the reason is that women are by far more intelligent than men and should be given more political appointments. “The Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina Muhammed was selected not because she was a woman but because she performed excellently well in her previous position. “When ‘I am invited to a function and women are gathered dancing, I just wonder why women should be dancing at a function when they ought to be given better positions at the function. “Women in politics stay for meetings till 2am. So if your husband allows you to join politics, he should be ready to support you. “Any woman I have ever given appointment merited it. However, women are also a problem unto themselves because whenever an appointment is given to a woman, the others start saying the man is dating the woman and that she did not get the appointment because she merited it,” he said.
