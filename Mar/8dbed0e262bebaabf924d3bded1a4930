Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has advised youngster players to prepare themselves for not making it at the club. According to the England forward, this will help them not to get too down if they fail to make it at Old Trafford. Rashford has been in fine form for United this season, scoring 18 goals and providing 12 assists in 45 appearances. He made breakthrough in the United first team in 2016 and has now scored 90 goals in 273 games. Speaking to Jay Shetty’s podcast for #ILoveUnited, the 23-year-old gave an insight into his own mind. “Just to try and improve every day,” Rashford said. “But making it at United is different to making it as a footballer. As a youngster, you have to prepare yourself for not making it at United, just in order for not getting too down if it doesn’t happen. “It enables you to keep going. To play for United is a massive achievement for me and I feel really proud to be here.”
