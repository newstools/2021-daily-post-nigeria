Everton manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has named Manchester City as the “best team in the world”, following their FA Cup defeat on Saturday. The Merseysiders managed to keep City at bay for over 80 minutes of their quarter-final clash at Goodison Park. However, late goals from Ilkay Gundogan and Kevin De Bruyne sent City through with a 2-0 win. “We were almost there, we did well and we did the best that we can do. We defended well and for at least 80 minutes, we had the game under control,” Ancelotti told BT Sport after the final whistle on Saturday. “I am satisfied because we were beaten by the best team in the world – they are the best. “We wanted to keep them uncomfortable. Of course, they are comfortable with the ball but we defended well and we didn’t concede space. We played the game that we wanted to play. “They have the best bench in the world. It was a good experience for us and there are no regrets.”
