Carlo Ancelotti has told Everton forward Alex Iwobi to open up to him on his preferred position. The Italian gaffer said he would not hesitate to field the Nigeria international in any position of his choice. Iwobi had recently dropped a write up on Instagram saying he hopes to play in his preferred position. The player made the comment after he was included in the Gernot Rohr’s list of Super Eagles players to prosecute the African Cup of Nations qualifying matches against Benin Republic and Lesotho later this month. Under Ancelotti at Everton, Iwobi has played in multiple positions this season, including right winger, left winger, left wing-back, right wing-back and even at fullback. But while on national duty, Rohr has often fielded him as number 10 and the former Real Madrid boss said that the former Arsenal star has never approached him about his preferred position on the field During his prematch press conference on Friday, the former Chelsea manager was asked about Iwobi’s comment, and the Italian said, “I read the post that he did and I want to speak of course, I would like to know him, his preferred position, because usually I want to put a player on the pitch where they are comfortable to play not where they are uncomfortable to play. “And if he has an idea of where he prefers to play I have to know, I want to know, I am delighted to know his preferred position, I put him in his preferred position for sure, no doubt. “I’m going to tell him, ‘tell me I am your manager, tell me where you prefer to play’. “If he wants to play number 10 or number 9 I’ll put him there, no problem. I can adapt the system.”
