They are to be guided by the oath they have taken to dispense justice to all manners of petitioners and respondents without fear or favor, ill will or affection”, Justice Kaigama said after the inauguration on Friday.  He also charged members of the tribunals to work as a team in the discharge of their responsibility. “People in the state should have confidence in the tribunal, because they were constituted by the Judicial Service Commission after they have been thoroughly screened before they were appointed for the tribunals. “Therefore, we expect nothing but justice from them”, he said.

The Local Government Election Appeal Tribunal consists three panels, while that of Petition has six panels each with a chairman and two members respectively.
