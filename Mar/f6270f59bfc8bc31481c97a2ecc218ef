The Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) has taken down a template they published on their website on Friday, which announced that the new price of petrol has reached N212.6 per litre. This follows the criticism and outrage that followed the news. PPPRA published the template on its website, http://pppra.gov.ng/pms-guiding-price-for-march-2021/ Hours later, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) insisted that there was no increment in the ex-depot price of petrol. According to the (now deleted) template, petrol was to sell between N209.61 and N212.61. Nigerian marketers usually use the upper band for pump price. However, the template has now been deleted as at 11.27am on Friday. The website page showed ‘Page not found 404’.
