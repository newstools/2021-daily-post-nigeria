Chelsea striker, Timo Werner, has told the club’s manager, Thomas Tuchel, to keep ‘screaming’ at him on the touchline ahead of their Premier League clash with Liverpool tonight at Anfield. Werner feels that by Tuchel screaming at him from the touchline, he will be given an extra boost as he aims to rediscover his best form for Chelsea. The 24-year-old has only scored one goal since Tuchel took over from Frank Lampard last January. “I can talk to him [Thomas Tuchel] very easily,” Werner told the BBC. “When he screams on the pitch, no problem for me. I need types of managers who scream at me. “It gives me more power.” Werner added: “You can always learn more from the bad situations. I learned to trust in myself, to give everything on the pitch, not only think about goals and fight for the team. “Now, I hope this period is gone, and I score a few more goals until the end of the season. “A lot of good strikers come to the Premier League and take one year to settle down and adapt. “I think my form is going up and getting better and better. Maybe this year is not the year of goal scoring for Timo, but in the end, I will reflect on the season. “I have learned a lot. I know exactly the teams we play against, how they play.“
