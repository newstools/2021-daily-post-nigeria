Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has complained about Tottenham Hotspur’s Europa League scheduling ahead of the North London Derby on March 14. Spurs’ first leg against Dinamo Zagreb three days before the derby was initially supposed to take place in Croatia, but has been since moved by UEFA to London. The Gunners, however, will travel to Greece to play Olympiacos. Arteta called the change unfair, as it would allow Spurs get extra rest, while his own team must fly back from European action. “Unfortunately, it’s not going to change,” Arteta told reporters. “We can raise our voices and we should do that because we want to have two teams playing in equal conditions. “But the decision has been made and that’s it. I don’t want to use one bit of excuse going towards that game saying ‘oh, they have an advantage’. So no, probably, I will use that to take it in our advantage. And that’s it.”
