The Kwara State government has directed that the ten schools where the use of hijab is under dispute will remain shut until a later date. DAILY POST reports that the ten Christian mission schools were expected to resume Monday, March 8. The schools were shut following the face-off between the Muslims and Christians over the use of hijab which the government later officially approved in the schools. Our correspondent gathered that the leadership of the Christian community had directed pupils and students of the ten schools to appear in their various religious dress codes as they are about to resume on Monday. The decision, according to a statement by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education and Human Capital Development, Mrs Kemi Adeosun, “has been taken for safety reasons.” The schools affected are C&S College Sabo Oke; St Anthony College, Offa Road; ECWA School, Oja Iya; Surulere Baptist School; Bishop Smith Secondary School, Agba Dam. Others include, CAC Secondary School, Asa Dam; St Barnabas Secondary School Sabo Oke; St John School Maraba; St Williams Secondary School, Taiwo Isale; and St James Secondary School, Maraba. The government directed school children and teachers in the affected schools to remain at home until the contrary is announced. “The government remains committed to fairness, pluralism and respect for the law and rights of every citizen at all times,” it added. DAILY POST recalls that some Christian denominations under the umbrella of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, in the State are resisting the use of hijab in their schools. They are also demanding the return of the Christian mission schools to their owners.
