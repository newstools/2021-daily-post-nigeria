The Katsina State Police Command says it has arrested three persons who called themselves spirits (Aljannu) to defraud people. The state Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Gambo Isah made this known in a statement on Friday. The PPRO identified the suspects as Usman Adamu, 40; Abba Ibrahim, 38; and Abdurrauf Iliyasu, 39. According to the police spokesman, “Nemesis caught up with them when they called a woman, Jamila Sulaiman, on her phone that they were spirits (Aljannu), and directed her to go to the outskirts of Yar-Gamji village and drop the sum of N150,000 or risk her parents or children being killed by spirits”. He said the victim, out of fear, complied with the suspects and dropped the money at the location. According to Isah, the victim also transferred N97,000 into the suspect’s bank account before police intervened. He said the command was able to apprehend the suspects following intelligence during the investigation. Isa also said the suspects confessed to the crime during interrogation. According to him, they will be prosecuted immediately after the ongoing investigation is concluded.
