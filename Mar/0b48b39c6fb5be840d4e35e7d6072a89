Kadiri Oshoakhemhe in the petition asked the Edo State High Court sitting in Benin City to disqualified the APC Deputy governorship candidate for presenting false information to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in his form EC9 affidavit. Following the court’s decision, the APC governorship candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, filed an application to set aside the judgement of the lower court and dismiss the suit filed by Kadiri Oshoakhemhe. Reading the judgement, Justice B. A Georgewill said, “the judgement of the trial court delivered on January 6 which disqualified the appellant and Audu Ganiyu from contesting as Governor and Deputy governor is set aside”. The three-man panel also unanimously said the appeal is meritorious.
