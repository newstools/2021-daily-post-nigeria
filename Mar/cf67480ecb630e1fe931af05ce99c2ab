The Northern States Governors Forum, NSGF, has described as disturbing the Saturday’s attack carried out on the convoy of the Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom. The forum observed the security challenges in the country required all stakeholders in the country to take steps towards making the country free for all to go about their normal activities. Recall that on Saturday, Ortom’s convoy was attacked at Tyo-Mu community near Makurdi by suspected bandits. Plateau State Governor and chairman of the forum, Barrister Simon Bako Lalong, explained that the incident leading to the attack on the governor’s convoy must be thoroughly investigated and those found responsible should be made to face the wrath of the law. He said that the Northern governors would leave no stone unturned to engage and support security agencies in their duty of securing the entire region and nation from the hands of the bandits. In a statement through his Director of Press and Public Affairs, Dr Makut Macham, Governor Lalong noted that the attack on Governor Ortom was another attempt by criminals to cause mayhem in Benue state and in the nation as a whole. He tasked all relevant security agencies to ensure they conduct a thorough investigation to bring the perpetrators of the devilish act and their sponsors to light. The forum hailed the efforts of the security details attached to governor Ortom for repelling the attackers and securing the governor and all his entourage. The chairman explained that members of the Northern Governors’ Forum are in solidarity with governor Ortom and the entire people of the state.
