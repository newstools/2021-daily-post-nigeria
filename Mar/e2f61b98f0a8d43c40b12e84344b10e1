The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Thursday, brokered peace between the Ogun factions led by late Buruji Kashamu and Ladi Adebutu. Linus Okorie, Secretary, PDP National Reconciliation and Strategy Committee, issued a statement after the peace meeting. He said Chairman of the Committee, Bukola Saraki, announced the resolution of the decade-old crisis in the state chapter. The warring groups, over the years, instituted different court cases and obtaining injunctions against successive Ogun executive committees. PDP said the actions weakened the platform made many people to believe that the differences would never be resolved. “The crisis was responsible for the loss of the PDP in the state during the past three general elections Today, both parties have resolved to work together and withdraw all cases pending in the various courts”, Okorie noted. The scribe said the groups agreed that PDP remains the best umbrella under which the unity and development of Nigeria can be achieved, sustained and guaranteed. Okorie confirmed they all signed an agreement to that effect, adding that the party will work to regain control of Ogun State in 2023. The statement thanked leaders and stakeholders in Ogun State, who played key roles in helping to end the crisis.
