Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, left the Emirates Stadium just 23 minutes after their 2-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, after being dropped for the match for turning up late to a team meeting. Aubameyang was set to start on Sunday, but turned up late to the team meeting. It left manager Mikel Arteta no choice than to drop him from the line-up. Aubameyang left his team-mates and coaches waiting by turning up to the ground in his holographic chrome-wrapped Ferrari after the meet time. And according to The Athletic, Aubameyang left quickly in his expensive sports car and did not do a post-match warm down with the rest of the unused substitutes. He also decided not to celebrate with his team-mates on the pitch after the Derby win and was one of the first players to go down the tunnel at the full-time whistle.
