Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has criticized his players, including Christian Pulisic, following his side’s 2-0 win over Sheffield United in the FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday at Stamford Bridge. Tuchel said Chelsea players lost control, concentration and momentum against Sheffield, adding that they gave the visitors two big chances during the encounter. A first-half own goal from Oliver Norwood and a late strike from Hakim Ziyech ensured Chelsea qualified for the FA Cup semi-finals. “The second half, there was a chance for Christian (Pulisic) that we didn’t take, and then we lost control, concentration and momentum. And there were many, many minutes to suffer,” Tuchel said at his post-match press conference after the game. “We allowed two big chances, and we were lucky to escape with a clean sheet. “There are, of course, many situations that explain that, and this is absolutely okay after 14 matches. “So in the end, big, big compliments to the players; and well done.” Chelsea’s next game is against West Brom on April 3.
