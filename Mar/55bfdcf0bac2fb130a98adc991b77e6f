The Lagos State Police Command has denied the video making rounds on the internet about its officers stealing phones from a shop in Computer Village, Ikeja Lagos. There was a viral video making rounds on the internet which showed two mobile police officers being assaulted after they were accused of stealing phones from a shop at Computer Village. Reacting, Spokesperson of the state police command, Ademuyiwa Adejobi, in a statement released Monday, said the officers were wrongfully accused of committing a crime. He said the people who made the video had a motive which was to ridicule the entire Nigeria Police Force. According to him, the policemen never went to buy phones, neither were they caught in any act of theft in the computer village. “The HP Electronics Company’s Taskforce on piracy, in company of some police operatives, were at the shop located at No 30, Awolowo Road, Opposite Glass House, Ikeja, Lagos, on a routine check against piracy and sub-standard products in the market. “Suddenly, some hoodlums who appeared from nowhere attacked the team. “They created a scene, calling them thieves and passing unpleasant comments on the policemen in order to distract and halt the routine checks. “The team was also chased away by the hoodlums who hindered the success of the operation due to their criminal tendencies.’ “Lastly, the Lagos State Police command wishes to make it clear that the policemen captured in the video are not thieves but operatives on official and legal operation at the computer village contrary to the wrong impression painted by the perpetrators of the fake video on the social media,” he said.
