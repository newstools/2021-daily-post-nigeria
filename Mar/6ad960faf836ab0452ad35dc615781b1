Two hunters were said to have been killed by suspected herdsmen in Okun-Owa, Odogbolu Local Government Area of Ogun State. Residents of the community said they discovered the bodies of the slain hunters in Oko-Agerige. DAILY POST reports that leaders of the community have written a letter to Okun-Owa, urging him to save their souls. According to Asiwaju Sina Ogunbambo, the leader of the community, the hunters were killed by herdsmen. Ogunbambo said they were declared missing on Saturday after they failed to return home a night they embarked on hunting. “A search party went to the forest and their shocking discovery was the corpses of the two young men,” Ogunbambo said in the letter sent to Gov Abiodun. Quoting sources who visited the scene, he disclosed that there were gun bullets lodged on the bodies of the dead hunters; adding that cow dungs and footprints were also seen at the scene of the crime. This, he said, made them to arrive at the conclusion that the perpetrators were herdsmen. Ogunbambo appealed to Gov Abiodun to act fast by protecting the lives of Okun-Owa residents. The Ogun State Police Spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the death of the hunters. Oyeyemi stated that the hunters were murdered while searching for some people that were earlier kidnapped in the forest.
