Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has insisted that Manchester United can still challenge his team to win the Premier League title this season. Man United are still 11 points behind Man City on the log with just ten games to go. The Red Devils defeated Guardiola’s side 2-0 at Etihad last Saturday. Asked if Man City could still be hauled in by Man United, Guardiola told a press conference on Tuesday ahead of Man City’s game against Southampton on Wednesday: “Of course when the options are open, anything can happen in football. “Nobody thought we could go [winning] 21 games in a row, 15 in the Premier League, so everything can happen. “A team like [Manchester] United can do it. There are ten games left, and we have to win six or seven to be champions mathematically. “We are going to try and win the first one tomorrow [against Southampton].”
