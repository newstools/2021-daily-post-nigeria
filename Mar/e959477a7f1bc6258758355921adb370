The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has vowed not to surrender to what it called ‘electoral banditry’ aimed at discrediting the electoral process and returning pre-determined outcomes. Mr. Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, made the vow in an interview with NAN, on Sunday, in Abuja. Okoye was speaking on the decision to indefinitely suspend the Saturday Ekiti East State Constituency 1 election held in Ekiti State. He said that the decision was necessary to preserve the integrity of the country’s elections, as well as safeguard the lives of citizens. Okoye said that for the commission to proceed with any election in the face of brazen violence that had compromised the integrity of an election, would amount to dereliction of its electoral duty. He noted that the Resident Electoral Commissioner for Ekiti State (REC) issued a statement detailing the level of violence unleased on voters, election officials and security personnel on election duty. The INEC commissioner said that the commission had reinforced the situation report of the REC for Ekiti by imposing an indefinite postponement of the state constituency 1 by-election. “These measures are necessary to preserve the integrity of elections and the life and safety of voters, election officials and security personnel on election duty. “INEC will never condone electoral banditry aimed at discrediting the electoral process and returning predetermined outcomes”, he stated. DAILY POST recalls that following the killing of three persons who were shot dead by gunmen while a policewoman, corps member and INEC staff sustained gunshot injuries during the Saturday election, the commission suspended the exercise.
