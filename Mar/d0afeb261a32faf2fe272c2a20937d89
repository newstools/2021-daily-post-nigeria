Senators from the southern part of Nigeria, under the aegis of Southern Senators Forum, on Wednesday, pledged commitment to indivisibility of Nigeria. Addressing a press conference at the National Assembly after the inauguration of the forum’s leadership in Abuja, Senator Bamidele Opeyemi, who emerged Chairman of the group, said, they were aware of the storms blazing through the nation, but they have resolved to manage it in order to keep the nation as one. He said: “Our position is that we have to manage our unity in diversity. “We further look forward to strengthening the leadership of the Senate. We would provide voice for our people that we came here to represent. “We would use the platform to strengthen the unity of Nigeria that we have all promised to uphold. Speaking earlier, Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, revealed that he opted out of the regional lawmakers group because of his position, but maintained that the group cooperates with Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan’s leadership to ensure that the nation moves forward. According to him, the group has been existing in the last two years, but the inauguration has to take place now to bring lawmakers who belong to different political parties to unity. “We have the northern senators forum which was inaugurated some time ago. By June 11, we would be in Senate for two years and we felt we need to inaugurate the leadership for southern senators forum. “Let me make it very clear that we are united, both the northern and southern senators. “We are United behind the leadership of the 9th Senate. We have resolved that notwithstanding the challenges facing the country, we would support a United Nigeria”, Omo-Agege said.
