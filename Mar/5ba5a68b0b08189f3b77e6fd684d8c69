The Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, has said the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) will soon collapse. According to him, APC has lost focus and Nigerians no longer had confidence in the party. Tambuwal stated this while speaking to supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), during the flag off of the Eastern Senatorial Zone campaign at Gwadabawa town, in readiness for the local government elections on March 27. He added that was why he was not surprised by the decision of the state chapter of the APC to boycott the local government elections. Tambuwal noted that the APC-led government had failed to deliver or execute any meaningful development projects since its inception. According to him, Nigerians would no longer support APC, and as such it would “collapse woefully and dissolved into other political parties”.
