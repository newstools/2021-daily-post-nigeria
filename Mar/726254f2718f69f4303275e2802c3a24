The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has shut two filling stations in Lagos for under-dispensing of petrol. Mr Ayorinde Cardoso, Zonal Operations Controller, DPR, Lagos, said this after an inspection visit to eight filling stations located in Ikorodu Road, Oshodi-Apapa Expressway and Ikeja areas of the state. According to him, the sealed stations were under-dispensing and have been sanctioned, NAN reports. He noted that they will have to pay their sanctions and will rectify their pumps to the acceptable standard before they are reopened “Then we will come back and re-evaluate the pumps before they can be allowed to reopen,” Cardoso noted. He added the intensification of routine surveillance by the DPR in Lagos was aimed at monitoring product price, quality, availability, pump efficiency as well as water ingress in some tanks. Cardoso disclosed that the petrol stations inspected were selling fuel between N162 to N165 per litre which was the approved price band by the government. Cardoso urged members of the public against panic buying ahead of the forthcoming Easter season, noting that there was product sufficiency in Lagos State.
