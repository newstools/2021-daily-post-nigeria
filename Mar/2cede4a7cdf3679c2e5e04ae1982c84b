Atletico Madrid striker, Marcos Llorente, has warned Chelsea that the LaLiga leaders will be looking to evoke the strength of Anfield at Stamford Bridge when both teams clash in the Champions League round of 16, second-leg tie on Wednesday night. Chelsea defeated Atletico Madrid 1-0 in the first-leg in Bucharest last month, thanks to Olivier Giroud’s stunning goal. But Diego Simeone’s men are more than familiar with coming from behind, stunning Liverpool last season in the Champions League round 16 second-leg fixture after going behind at Anfield in extra time, despite taking a one-goal lead from the first-leg. On that evening, Atletico scored three goals in extra-time to progress to the last-8, and the scorer of two of those goals, Llorente, believes his side will draw upon that experience as they take on Thomas Tuchel’s men. “We have had big games when things get ugly,” Llorente told Marca. “We have to remember what we did on the day of Liverpool, that we are capable of that. “I am sure that we will go for it and get the win.” The kick-off time for the match is 9 pm.
