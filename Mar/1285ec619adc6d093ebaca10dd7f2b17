The Kaduna State High Court on Wednesday fixed May 25 to rule on the no-case submission filed by the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), Sheikh Ibraheem EL-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat. The presiding Judge, Justice Gideon Kurada, adjourned the case to May 25 for ruling on no case submission. Zakzaky and his wife have been standing trial for culpable homicide and criminal conspiracy which was charged against them by the Kaduna State Government. However, at the resumed hearing of the case the prosecution closed its case by calling its last witness to testify. Speaking to newsmen after the ruling, the lead counsel, Femi Falana (SAN), represented by Marshal Abubakar said that the State eventually closed its case today. According to him, “They have also asked for a day to enter their defense. “There has been no case submission so far. What we filed earlier on was a motion to quash and trash before the commencement of the trial. “At this stage, the state has indeed called their witnesses and it is our view that there is no case so far has been established,” he said.
