Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted the possible outcome of some of the Premier League fixtures that will be played this weekend. Saturday’s early kick-off will see Arsenal travelling to Burnley. Berbatov told BetFair: “I saw Burnley’s match against Leicester and let me tell you Schmeichel was the man of the match, he made some unbelievable saves, so Burnley are not a team to be underestimated. “In this league, there are so many surprises and inasmuch as I like the way Arteta wants them to play, Arsenal are still a bit shaky in defence, so I’m backing Burnley in this one. Prediction 1-0.” On the Manchester Derby on Sunday, the Bulgarian added: “I don’t want to see a boring game. The last time these two sides met in the Premier League, I almost fell asleep for that. “I want United to put an end to this City winning streak. I think it will be on the minds of the City players and United can take advantage of that, so I am going to go with them. Prediction 2-3.”
