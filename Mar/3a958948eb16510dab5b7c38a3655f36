A community development group, Urban Alert has called on the management of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) to fulfil its promise of distributing prepaid electricity metres to its customers who have paid for it. The call was made by the group in a publicly circulated statement obtained by DAILY POST. According to the statement, the Urban Alert team after a town hall meeting organised some weeks back was invited to the Ede Business Hub of IBEDC to track the distribution of prepaid metres to some of the customers who had paid for the metres between 2015 and 2017. The group stated that out of the 314 complainants from the Ede Business Hub who were supposed to receive their metres, only 24 complainants were serviced which represents just 7.6 percent of the margin. While acknowledging that the electricity distribution company is making moves to deliver these metres to its customers, they also expressed dissatisfaction at the slow pace of the delivery. The group stated that they were optimistic IBEDC will fulfil its promise to distribute the prepaid metres within the shortest time frame as the delivery of the metres to the affected complainants are being awaited. Meanwhile, efforts by DAILY POST to reach out to the spokesperson of IBEDC proved abortive as messages sent via SMS and emails were not replied to and phone calls were left unanswered. DAILY POST recalls that Urban Alert organized a Town Hall meeting towards resolving the Prepaid Meter Injustice on the suffering masses in Osun State during which an ultimatum of four weeks was unanimously given to IBEDC to issue the meters.
