The most wanted Fulani herdsman in Ibarapa Local Government of Oyo State, Iskili Wakili was allegedly killed in the early hours of Sunday. According to reports reaching DAILY POST, he was killed along with his wife, and three children, while his house and cattle were burnt to ashes. The operation was allegedly led by Sunday Igboho and his group. Recall that Sunday Igboho championed the eviction of the Sarkin Fulani, Salihu Abdulkadir in Igangan, following the quit notice issued him and his people recently in the Ibarapa Local Government Area. Salihu relocated to Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, following his eviction. Reacting to the latest development, the coordinator of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association in Kwara State, Aliyu Mohammed, described it “as unacceptable.” He wondered whether Sunday Igboho had now become a security operative that would be allowed to operate illegally without being checked by the authorities. Mohammed, told DAILY POST in Ilorin that “if unchecked, the situation could be dangerous for the Fulani and would be interpreted as a ploy to wipe them out of the area.” He demanded the arrest of Sunday Igboho. “If the Fulani go against the law, charge them to court rather than the jungle justice meted out to them on trumped up charges,” he added. Mohammed further urged the Oyo State government and the police authorities to act on time before it is too late.
