Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo and ex-Senate President, Bukola Saraki on Tuesday met behind closed-doors. The meeting was held at the Olusegun Obasanjoâ€™s Presidential Library in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Saraki arrived the venue of the meeting at about 12:12pm and immediately went straight into a closed-door session with Obasanjo at his Pent House residence located within the library. Saraki who is the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Reconciliation Committee has been meeting with some aggrieved members of the party lately. Recall that the former president had in 2015 torn his PDP membership card publicly. Obasanjo had torn the membership card during the build-up to the 2015 presidential election which President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress, APC, won. Obasanjo had endorsed Buhari over ex-President Goodluck Jonathan after he tore the membership card. After his action, the former president had announced his retirement from partisan politics.
