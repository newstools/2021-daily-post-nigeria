NAN reports that Ajumogobia who was re-arraigned before Justice Mohammed Liman pleaded not guilty to the charges levelled against her Counsel to the defendant, Mr Mobolaji Kuji, while presenting his case urged the court to allow his client continue on the terms and conditions of bail earlier given by Justice Rilwan Aikawa before whom the defendant had earlier been arraigned.
