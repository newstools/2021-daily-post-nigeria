The Adamawa State Police Command has arrested two men and a woman for allegedly extorting money from people. The Police said the three usually force money from their victims by threatening to kidnap them if they refuse to cooperate. A statement signed by the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, named the suspects as Suleiman Adamu, a resident of Alkali Street in Demsawo, Yola North Local Government Area; Abdullahi Ayuba who resides in Ghana Street, Bekaji also in Yola North and Zainab Ahondu, a resident of Jalingo in Taraba State. The statement said the three were apprehended at their various hideouts in Viniklang and Doubeli in Girei and Yola North local government areas. The statement informed that the arrest followed reports received and an intense search by police detectives attached to the State Intelligence Bureau (SIB). “Investigations so far reveal that the suspects always extort their victims with text messages threatening to kidnap them if a certain amount is not paid,” the statement explained. It said the Commissioner of Police, CP Aliyu Adamu Alhaji commended the OC SIB and his men for making it difficult for the criminals to escape arrest. He directed further investigations into the matter to unearth more evidence for proper prosecution.
