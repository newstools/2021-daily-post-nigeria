A chieftain of the All Progress Congress, APC, in Delta State, Chief Nelson Agbamuche, has alleged that some members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, have threatened his life following the just concluded Local Government election in the state. The allegation was contained in a statement he personally signed and made available to DAILY POST on Thursday. According to the statement, the traditional chief alleged that some members of the PDP in the state, led by some of their leaders have vowed to unleash mayhem on him and his family members. He alleged that the national opposition party, during the Saturday council election in the state, launched violence on APC loyalists. Recall that the Chieftain, Agbamuche who is the Odoziani of Akwukwu-Igbo recently dumped PDP to join APC. “There have been series of attacks on my properties and plots to eliminate me, leading to some unfortunate attacks on my supporters. The reason for the acrimony is because I choose to identify with a progressive party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) which has brought and still bringing development to my community. “I thought it wise to join the APC having spent years in the PDP without any noticeable benefit to my people, but my former party chieftains won’t recognise my fundamental human rights of freedom o association guaranteed in our constitution and the African charter”, he stated. He further alleged that members of the PDP were using thugs and local vigilantes to attack him and some members of his new party (APC) Speaking on his move to alert security agencies on the alleged threat to his life, he said, “I have already petitioned the Inspector General of Police on this matter, having lodged formal complaints at the state level with no visible action taken”.
