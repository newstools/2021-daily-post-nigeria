The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has called on the Yobe State Governor, Mala Mai Buni to resign as governor and Interim National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC. PDP made the call following the pronouncement of the Supreme Court, which found the leadership of the party as “irresponsible and reckless.” The Supreme Court had given the ruling for engaging in unsubstantiated allegations against its justices. However, PDP said the Supreme Court ruling has confirmed that APC is a party of blackmailers and falsehood. In a series of tweets, PDP wrote: “The @OfficialPDPNig has asked Yobe state Governor Mala Mai Buni to resign his position as governor and Interim National Chairman of @OfficialAPCNg, following the pronouncement of the Supreme Court. “It is indeed appalling that the illegal Mai Buni leadership of the @OfficialAPCNg could, in their penchant for falsehood, go to the extent of falsely accusing the Justices of the Supreme Court of holding a meeting leaders allegedly to subvert justice, in a case, in which the PDP is not even a party. “The pronouncement of the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, has ultimately vindicated our stand that the @OfficialAPCNg is a party of irresponsible, reckless and dishonorable persons, who only thrive in fabrications, falsehood, lies, blackmail and character assassination.”
