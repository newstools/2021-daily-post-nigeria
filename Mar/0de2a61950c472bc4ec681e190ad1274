Martial sustained an injury during Man United’s Europa League 1-1 draw against AC Milan. The France international was forced off at half-time against Milan. Two goals from Amad Diallo and Simon Kjaer ensured both Man United and AC Milan drew at Old Trafford. Providing an update on Martial, Solskjaer said at post-match press conference, “It’s another scan we need to look at. “I don’t think he will be ready for Sunday. Edinson’s not [ready] for Sunday [either].”
