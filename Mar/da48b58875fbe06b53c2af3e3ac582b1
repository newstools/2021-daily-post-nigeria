The Nigeria National Summit Group (NNSG) has cautioned Biafra and Yoruba nations’ proponents. The organisation said the declaration of sovereignty of some sections of the country was criminal. In a statement on Monday, Tony Uranta, the Executive Secretary, inisisted Nigeria must not be allowed to fail or splinter. Secessionists including Nnamdi Kanu, Sunday Igboho, Asari Dokubo, have at different times announced factionalized entities. The NNSG scribe advised the authorities to act decisively against every anti-law and order individual. He noted that the news about groups or persons proclaiming independence “are frighteningly bizarre”. Uranta said the challenges Nigerians will face due to such declarations “must not be treated with kid gloves. “Leaders nationwide must urge restraints on anybody, group or people leading or making such calls.” Uranta urged the federal government to initiate and convene a reconciliatory national roundtable. “Such roundtable will focus on the principles distilled and agreed upon during the 2014 National Conference,” he added. NNSG demanded that insecurity be resolved as soon as possible to ensure national stability.
