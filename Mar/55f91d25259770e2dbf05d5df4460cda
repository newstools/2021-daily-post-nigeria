Professor of Virology, Oyewale Tomori, on Monday, said all government officials should be compelled to take the COVID-19 first when they arrive the country. Tomori while speaking during an interview on Channels TV programme, ‘Sun Rise’, on Monday, said doing that would change the perception of some Nigerians towards the vaccine. He noted that once the leaders have been vaccinated and they are still healthy, people will start to have confidence in the vaccines. “Let’s see some of those government people take thee vaccines and then we’ll watch them and see whether they survive or they don’t survive. Then gradually, we’ll begin to build up people’s immunity,” he said. “But tell me to go and get the vaccine and then you are taking your own children to Dubai to go and take another vaccine, of course, I will not believe in you. “Do it openly at the Eagles Square. Get the big people there, the legislature, whatever, then we’ll convince our people that it is safe to take.” “It is a gradual thing, over time, people will now begin to say these guys that have got it did not die, did not fall sick, therefore, I can go there and take it. That’s what we need to do. Leadership in this country has to come from the top,” he said. He said the apart from the health workers, Nigerians need the leaders to come out openly and take the vaccine. DAILY POST recalls that the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha, on Sunday, confirmed that Nigeria will on Tuesday, March 2, receive the first batch of the coronavirus vaccines. “Nigeria is set to receive its first four million shipment of COVID-19 vaccines from COVAX. “The vaccines should depart India on March 1, 2021 in the night and arrive Abuja on the 2nd of March, 2021, ” he said. —
