Liverpool legend, Mark Lawrenson, has predicted Tottenham Hotspur to beat Arsenal when both teams clash in the Premier League on Sunday at Emirates. Lawrenson believes Jose Mourinho’s side have what it takes to defeat the Gunners because Spurs have hit form and found some consistency. Providing his prediction, Lawrenson told BBC Sport, “Tottenham are firing properly now – they have scored four goals in three of their past four games – and Jose Mourinho is always very keen to let people know about it. “I don’t blame Jose for banging his drum about it because Spurs have hit form and found some consistency. “That’s what Arsenal need – they have produced some good performances recently, but I am still not really sure what to expect from them a week to week. Arsenal 0-2 Tottenham.” The kick-off time for the match is 5: 30 pm.
