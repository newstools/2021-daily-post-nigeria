Former Manchester United goalkeeper, Ben Foster, has chosen Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo over Lionel Messi of Barcelona in the debate on who is the world’s best football player. Appearing on the Happy Hour Podcast, Foster opened up on Ronaldo’s work ethics, describing him as the greatest of all time. Ben Foster spent time at United the same time Ronaldo was breaking records at Old Trafford “Animal! What a guy, seriously, and a lovely bloke as well. I’m not even joking. For example, he was the first one in every single day and he would be the last one out on the training pitch, and the last one to leave the building every day. “And when I was at United, it was the days before Instagram and Twitter, and ‘doing it for the ‘gram’, but he was doing it for himself because he just wanted to be the best he possibly could be.” Foster was breaking into the Manchester United first team during Ronaldo’s final two seasons at the Theatre of Dreams. “That is why, with the question between [Lionel] Messi and Ronaldo, I will always say Ronaldo,” he added. [This is] because I saw what he did for it and how hard he had to work to get to that level. He is still doing it now. “You see some of the stuff he does on the internet. He is a machine. An absolute machine! That level of mentality, phwoar, it is a different level.”
