Manchester City star man, Kevin De Bruyne has explained why he decided to leave Chelsea in 2014. The Belgium International said he felt there was no chance for him at Stamford Bridge at that time. He added that he never expected to become a superstar at Manchester City. De Bruyne left in January 2014, having previously spent the 2012-13 season on loan to Werder Bremen. This was after he struggled to make an impact with the west London Blues and he admits to having hit a career low as he bid farewell. “I decided to go away because I felt I didn’t have any chance of playing at the time,” he told Sky Sports. “I didn’t see more opportunities coming, so for me, it was the best decision to leave Chelsea and go to a situation where I felt I could start again. “Did I expect it to go this way? Obviously not because at that time it was a low point in my career but I never had any doubt in my abilities as a football player.”
