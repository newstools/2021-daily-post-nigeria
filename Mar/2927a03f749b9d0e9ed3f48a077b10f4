Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has confirmed that Edinson Cavani has withdrawn from the squad that will travel to Italy to take on AC Milan in the Europa League. Cavani was set to feature for the Red Devils in the second leg of the last-16 tie but has suffered a reaction to a recent injury. “Unfortunately, it looks like Edinson has got a bit of a reaction to training today and didn’t feel ready to travel,” Solskjaer said. The 34-year-old striker has been fighting to be fit in recent weeks and has already missed six of United’s last seven games. Solskjaer will be hoping that the attacking firepower at their disposal, can power them to the quarter-finals after the teams drew 1-1 at Old Trafford last week.
