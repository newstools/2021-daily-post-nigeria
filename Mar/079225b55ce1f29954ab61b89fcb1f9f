Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted the outcomes of the Premier League clashes involving Arsenal, West Ham, Tottenham and Aston Villa this weekend. Tottenham will look to bounce back from their Europa League disappointing outing when they face Aston Villa this weekend. Spurs manager, José Mourinho, as reports in London suggest, has been given a condition to make sure the team finish in the top four or be sacked. But Berbatov believes that “Spurs still have a chance to get into the top four, and now they can focus more on that.” According to him, the match between Spurs and Aston Villa will finish 1-3 in favour of Mourinho’s side. For Arsenal, Mikel Arteta’s Gunners were lucky to have made it to the next stage of the Europa League on Thursday night despite losing 1-0 at the Emirates Station to Olympiacos. They will now face high-flying David Motes West Ham in the Premier League. West Ham is currently above Arsenal on the EPL table. “I don’t know if they have admitted it yet, but they will be thinking about Champions League football, which is certainly achievable,” Berbatov said. “This game is definitely winnable for them[West Ham] too, we all know how shaky Arsenal can be at times, yes they won against Spurs but their defence cracks and makes stupid mistakes at times. The former Premier League went on to predict a 2-0 win for West Ham against Arsenal. “I can see West Ham getting a result and pushing for top four. Prediction 2-0,” he told Metro Sport.
