Former Arsenal striker and Monaco manager, has quit social media, citing lack of decisive action against discrimination and abuse. The former France International vowed never to return to social media until more is done by handlers of popular websites to tackle the menace Henry, a former Barcelona player is protesting what he described as a failure to tackle racism and bullying across different platforms. According to the 43-year-old, the problem is “too toxic to ignore” insisting he will not return until racism and abuse is tackled “with the same vigour and ferocity” that copyright infringements are. The former Premier League dreaded striker has 2.7 million followers on Instagram, 2.3m on Twitter, and 10 million people following him on Facebook. In a statement posted across his different social media platforms, Henry said: “From tomorrow [Saturday] morning I will be removing myself from social media until the people in power are able to regulate their platforms with the same vigour and ferocity that they currently do when you infringe copyright. “The sheer volume of racism, bullying and resulting mental torture to individuals is too toxic to ignore. There has to be some accountability. It is far too easy to create an account, use it to bully and harass without consequence and still remain anonymous. “Until this changes, I will be disabling my accounts across all social platforms. I’m hoping this happens soon.”
