President Muhammadu Buhari’s National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, said security agencies were not working closely as expected. Monguno spoke at the third quarterly meeting of Secretaries of State Governments (SSGs) held on Thursday in Abuja. The NSA urged states to improve their security situations through better training and funding. The retired General emphasised the need to engage community leaders to enhance intelligence gathering. “If you disengage community leaders, you will not have the type of intelligence you need:, NAN quoted him as saying. “Right now, security agencies do not work together as closely as expected. We have been trying to ensure unity of purpose and operation.” Monguno said Nigeria relies on traditional institutions because they are essential to security. “Leave out our traditional rulers, you will see all kinds of leaders of various sects filling the vacuum.” The NSA regretted that monarchs have been taken away from what they are supposed to coordinate. He urged the SSGs to make governors understand the importance of traditional rulers. Secretary to the government of the Federation, Mustapha, urged the SSGs to calibrate political structures in their states. Mustapha emphasised the need to come up with solutions that would work for the nation. The SGF said that there was a need for states to revisit the 1976 Dasuki Local Government reform.
