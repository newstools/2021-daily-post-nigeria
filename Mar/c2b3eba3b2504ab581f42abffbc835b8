Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has insisted he will keep taking Mohamed Salah off during games, if he doesn’t perform. Speaking to the media on Friday, Klopp made it clear he will take the best decisions for the team, without caring what the headlines will be. Salah, the Premier League’s leading scorer this season, was replaced around the hour mark at Anfield on Thursday night. The Egyptian winger was unable to hide his disbelief when leaving the field. “I think he enjoys the pressure [of being top scorer],” Klopp said. “He’s been outstanding again. I could have changed last night other players but it was more about who we bring on and he looked like he felt the intensity. He maybe saw it different, that’s fine. “We make these decisions in the moment. Then we have to explain it and you make stories. These discussions we’ve never had. “I cannot not change a player because I think there will be story on it.”
