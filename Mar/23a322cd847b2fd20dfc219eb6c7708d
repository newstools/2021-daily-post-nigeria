Nigerian music producer, Samklef has called out colleague, Simi describing her as ungrateful and a pretender. Samklef said this after Simi scolded him on Twitter for sexualising Tems. Samklef’s tweet read: “Everybody dey wait to see Tems ynash , me sef they wait. Responding , Simi wrote “WT* is wrong with you ?” This did not go down well with Samklef who created a thread calling out Simi describing her as a pretender who acts like an angel on social media but the opposite in reality. He berated the ‘Duduke’ crooner for correcting him in the public and not privately. “Simi is coming on my TL to pull me down, why didn’t you send me a DM to ask me to pull down the tweet and tell me it was not good. “People don’t know who you are , you’re one of the most ungrateful souls on this planet, you just pretend online as an angel but you’re worse. “You guys are too manipulative, you all wanted to drag me down. But I no they go anywhere, the hypocrisy in Nigeria is too much,” Samklef wrote. However, after being dragged on Twitter, Samklef went ahead to apologise for the tweet about Tems, saying it was only a joke not intended at disrespecting women. “People post worst things but are not dragged but my own Na problem. It’s was only a joke. But like I said respect to all the women out there, respect Tems. I’m sorry for the Unknowingly sensitive post,” his tweet read.
