AC Milan striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, broke down in tears as he revealed that his son didn’t want him to leave home after he made his stunning return to the Sweden national team. The 39-year-old, who is Sweden’s record goalscorer, was named in his country’s latest squad for their World Cup qualifiers against Georgia and Kosovo on Thursday and Sunday, respectively. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United star announced his retirement from international football after Sweden’s exit from Euro 2016. However, speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of Sweden’s clash against Georgia on Thursday, Ibrahimovic disclosed that he choked up when he asked his two sons, Maximilian, 14, and Vincent, 12, about his decision to make a U-turn on his international retirement. “Vincent cried when I left him,” Ibrahimovic told reporters. Ibrahimovic was visibly moved and was shedding a few tears after he recalled Vincent’s reaction to him leaving for international duty. He added: “To play in the national team is the biggest thing you can do as a football player, and as I was following them [Sweden], inside me I was feeling I think I can help them, I think I can do something.” “I have got the opportunity now to play for my country, and I do it with honour, but it’s not only about that — it sounds like I’m only happy to be here, but I’m here to get results, to bring results for the coach and my teammates and the whole country. “As much as I talk here, if I don’t bring results, here it means nothing.” Ibrahimovic has been in fine goalscoring form for Milan, scoring 17 goals in 23 appearances for the Serie A giants so far this season.
