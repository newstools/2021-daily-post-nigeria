Former Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar has charged stakeholders in Nigeria to break their silence and take proactive actions towards resolving the unemployment crisis bedeviling the country currently. Atiku gave the charge while reacting to a publication by Bloomberg’s Business on Saturday, projecting Nigeria to be a nation with the highest unemployment rate in the world. In a statement entitled ‘World’s Highest Unemployment Rate: Time To Help This Government Help Nigeria’, Atiku urged relevant stakeholders to help the President Muhammadu Buhari’s government not because of those in authority but to save the masses. The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP’s flagbearer in the 2019 presidential election, lamented that the government has refused to heed advice and suggestions from well-meaning Nigerians in a bid to solve economic problems. According to him, unemployment and poverty is the root cause of the current insecurity ravaging the entire country. “I have never felt so bad at being proven right, as I am by the report from Bloomberg Business on Saturday, March 27, 2021 that Nigeria is to emerge as the nation with the highest unemployment rate on Earth, at just over 33%. “We warned about this, but repeated warnings by myself and other patriots were scorned. And now this. “We are at a precipice as a nation and the truth is that all stakeholders and elder statesmen have to speak up on time, while there is still a Nigeria to save. This government obviously lacks the capacity to address our current challenges, and we must help them, not because of the government, but because of our people,” Atiku wrote. Reacting to the recent $1.5 billion approved by the Federal Executive Council, FEC to renovate the Port Harcourt Refinery, the former vice president blamed the FG government for approving such money for “what ought to be left to the private sector.
