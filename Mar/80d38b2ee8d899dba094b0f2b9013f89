Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has said that the entire Manchester United team should take the blame for their poor performance in the Europa League tie against AC Milan on Thursday night. An Amad Diallo goal saw Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men take the lead as the game headed into stoppage time, but a 93rd minute equalizer by Simon Kjaer saw the match end in a 1-1 draw. United goal keeper, Dean Henderson should have saved the header by Kjaer that saw the Italians secure the draw. However, Solskjaer said he is disappointed with the team’s performance. “Very disappointed to concede with one of the last kicks of the ball, or head. “That makes it harder of course, but it was always going to be going down to the second game there, anyway,” said the Norwegian. “I’ve seen him [Henderson] save them, but it’s the structure that we lose. We dropped too deep and we got blocked off and they got the header on. “We should have attacked the ball with the men we had there. We were a bit too slow with the possession.” United will travel to Italy next week to tackle AC Milan at San Siro for the second leg. The Italian side are now favourites to go through based on away goal rule.
