A Court of Appeal in Akure, Ondo State, on Friday, struck out the appeal filed by a former lecturer of Obafemi Awolowo University, Professor Richard Akindele, against his conviction for demanding sex for marks from a student, Monica Osagie. Akindele had challenged the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court to try offences under the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000. He was convicted on 17th December, 2018, by the Federal High Court, Osogbo, for official corruption and abuse of office in respect. Through his counsel, O. A. Ijatuyi, Akindele argued that since the alleged offence bothered on sexual harassment in the workplace, only the National Industrial Court (NIC) that had exclusive jurisdiction to try the case. He cited section 254 of the constitution. Akindele also argued that the ICPC failed to comply with its own Act which requires that cases of corruption be tried before a High Court designated by the Chief Judge of a state or the Federal Capital Territory. Delivering judgment in appeal no: CA/AK/80c/2019 Prof Richard Akindele v FRN, the court agreed with E. A. Shogunle, counsel for the respondent that the jurisdiction of the NIC in criminal matters is not exclusive. The court further held that S. 26(2) of the ICPC Act 2000 grants jurisdiction to any superior court of record to try offences under the Act. The court affirmed the trial and conviction of the Appellant and dismissed the appeal for lacking in merit.
