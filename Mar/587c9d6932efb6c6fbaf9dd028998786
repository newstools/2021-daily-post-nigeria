The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has kicked against the disbursement of the £4.2miilion recovered from the former Governor of Delta State, James Ibori for construction of roads. Recall that the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami during the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between the United Kingdom and Nigeria, said that the funds will be used to finance the 2nd Niger Bride, Lagos Ibadan Express Way and Abuja-Kano Express. SERAP in a statement released on Wednesday said the loot should be used for the direct benefit of the victims of corruption in Delta State. Part of the statement read: “The Ibori loot estimated to be £100m [including the planned return of £4m] should be used for the direct benefit of the victims of corruption in Delta State. The rights group vowed to take legal action to ensure victims are not denied justice. “We’ll pursue appropriate legal action to ensure that the victims are not denied justice and remedies,” the statement added.
