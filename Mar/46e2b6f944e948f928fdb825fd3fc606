Oba Adedotun Gbadebo, the Alake of Egbaland, on Saturday, warned that Nigeria’s failure could spell doom for the black race. The monarch advised Nigerians, irrespective of tribe, political or religious affiliations, to work together for the development of the country. Gbadebo spoke when the national leadership of the National Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) visited him at his palace in Ake, Abeokuta. Present were National Chairman, Musa Muhammed Maitakobi, Ogun State Chairman, Titilayo Akibu and other members. The Alake appealed to secessionists to have a rethink. “If Nigeria failed as a country, the entire black race had failed,’’ NAN quoted him as saying. The traditional ruler noted that Nigeria could not afford to go through a major crisis. “We must work together to make it, Nigeria must not fail; if Nigeria fails, the black race has failed and may it never happened.’’ In his remarks, Maitakobi disclosed that the association had concluded plans to release new buses into the road transport sector. Maitakobi announced the award of Grand Patron of the association to Oba Gbadebo. The visit to the Alake was part of activities marking the first anniversary of Akibu as the RTEAN state chairman.
