Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has said that Roberto Firmino didn’t feature in his side’s 1-0 defeat against Fulham because the Brazilian picked up a minor knock. Klopp also revealed why he dropped Sadio Mane to the bench as Liverpool suffered their sixth consecutive home defeat at Anfield against Fulham. Mario Lemina’s strike gave Fulham all three points against the Premier League champions. “Two changes we had to make because of little injuries, with Bobby and Ozan,” Klopp told Sky Sports. “The others [Mane, Trent] we thought it made absolute sense. We are in an intense period, and we have the opportunity now to change some players. “We’ve got now at least more sessions in the legs, so we thought it feels really well together, so that’s the plan behind it. Getting fresh legs back and try to give Fulham a proper fight.”
