The former senator representing Kogi West Senatorial District, Senator Dino Melaye has alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari is currently not with Nigerians but in transition. In a video he posted on his verified Facebook page on Thursday evening, the former senator ascribed the present security challenges to absence of Buhari. “If the president is with us, we cannot be suffering perilous time that we are suffering now, we cannot be in the situation we are in this country”, he said. Melaye said that the insecurity ravaging the entire country, ranging from banditry, terrorism, kidnapping, signified that the president “is not with us”. “It is so sad that the president is not available, he is not with us and he is yet to join our ancestors. “The president is in transition and anybody in transition cannot do anything. And that is why there is no coordination in governance”, Dino alleged. He added that “every facet of our national life is in danger, the country is on the edge, we are about to explode. “That is why everyone is doing what he or she likes, that is why nobody is in charge of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, that is why we are in the state of total confusion, darkness everywhere”.
