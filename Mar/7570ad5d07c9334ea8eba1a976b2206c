Chuks Ibegbu, the immediate past Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, under Chief John Nnia Nwodo, has called for the immediate inquiry into the ownership of oil blocs in the Niger Delta and the breakdown of staff, especially senior staff strength in Nigeria federal MDAs. Ibegbu noted that recent appointments by President Muhammadu Buhari regime in MDAs fell short of the federal character principle and must be reviewed. The Ohanaeze chieftain, who spoke with DAILY POST on Sunday, in Umuahia, took a swipe at Sharia states that destroy alcohol in their states but benefit from VAT on alcohol. He posited that it was hypocrisy of the highest order that must end, insisting that oil bloc ownership in the Niger Delta must also be reviewed. Ibegbu who doubles as Board of Trustees, of World Igbo Peoples Assembly (WIPAS), also criticized skewed appointments in the judiciary and the discriminatory admission policies in federal institutions, noting that those who were called educationally disadvantage people later assume all plum positions at the centre far above those they purport to be educationally advantaged. On the growing insecurity occasioned by Boko Haram attacks on the citizenry, Ibegbu lambasted some northern elites, for their actions and the Nigeria security that also used its alleged impunity measures to exacerbate the conflict. “Many innocent youths in the army are now dying over what they did not cause. “Let those that caused this war send their children to the North East war front. We cannot continue to loose our innocent youths under the guise of one Nigeria or One Army over what they don’t know about. “Sometimes its this same people that caused the war and insurgency that inform Boko Haram to ambush our soldiers and decimate them. This cannot continue,” Ibegbu warned.
