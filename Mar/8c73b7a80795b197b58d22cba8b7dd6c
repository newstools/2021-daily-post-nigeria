Manchester United striker, Edinson Cavani, has pledged to return to action for the club soon. The Uruguayan has been sidelined since Man United’s 1-1 draw against West Brom last month. The former Paris Saint-Germain star also missed Man United’s 0-0 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. After the game between Chelsea and Man United, Cavani posted on Instagram: “Eager to come back soon.” Hopefully, the 34-year-old will be available for Man United’s away Premier League clash against Crystal Palace on Wednesday night. Meanwhile, Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, confirmed before Man United’s clash with Chelsea that it was unfortunate Cavani could not make the trip to West London. Solskjaer’s side are currently in the second position on the Premier League table with 12 points adrift Manchester City.
