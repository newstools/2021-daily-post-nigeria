The Governor of Borno, Babagana Zulum, has claimed that his Bauchi counterpart, Bala Mohammed, will join the All Progressives Congress soon (APC). He stated this when he led the North-East Governors to perform the groundbreaking ceremony for the reconstruction of the Government House in Bauchi on Thursday. Zulum who is the Chairman of the North-East Governors’ Forum said, “The only quarrel that I am having with my colleague, the Governor of Bauchi State is his refusal to come into the APC. “But inshallah, very soon, he will join us. He’ll join the Progressives. I am here to support him.” The North-East Governors have been in Bauchi State since Wednesday for their 4th Zonal meeting hosted by the state.
