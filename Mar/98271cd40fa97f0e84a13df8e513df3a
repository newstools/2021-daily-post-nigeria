The Federal College of Education, FCE (Technical), Akoka, Lagos, has denied the installation of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) in female hostels. DAILY POST gathered that last Friday, the students staged a protest over alleged invasion of their privacy by the school management. There was outrage on social media after a recording of a CCTV camera found in one of the hostels went viral. Addressing reporters at a briefing, Wahab Azeez, the Provost, absolved the institution. Azeez said the students’ demonstration was over the eviction of illegal occupants from the Independent Hall. “It is true that some students demonstrated on Friday, March 5, 2021, basically to protest against the ejection of illegal female occupants and not because of what was reported”, NAN quoted him as saying. The Provost noted that the installation of cameras for security purpose was ongoing in public places of the College and not in female hostels. Azeez disclosed that the school processed and obtained TETFund sponsorship to install CCTV Cameras on the perimeter fence and buildings including male and female hostels. “The CCTV Cameras is not in the rooms, bathrooms or toilet areas. The installation is yet to be completed and not activated. No student privacy can be breached, it’s an installation done purely for security reasons.” The Provost also denied that 7,000 persons are cramped in the College accommodation that has 3,646 capacity. The students, he insisted, are comfortably accommodated, adding that the rules guiding the hostels do not permit illegal occupants or squatters.
