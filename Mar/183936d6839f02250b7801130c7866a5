A German mother accused of killing five out of her six children has been charged with murder on all five counts. Their names and ages were Melina (1), Leonie (2), Sophie (3), Timo (6) and Luca (8). The bodies were discovered at her flat in Solingen on September 3, 2020, DPA reports. The woman was 27 years old at the time of the crimes. It is believed she sedated the children before suffocating them. The suspect then threw herself in front of a train at the main railway station in nearby Dusseldorf. She was seriously injured but survived. The woman insists a stranger broke into her residence and murdered the children. The public prosecutor says there is no evidence to back her claims.
