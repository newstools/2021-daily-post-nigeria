A socio-cultural group, Ilorin Emirate Descendants Progressive Union, IEDPU, on Saturday, asked President Muhammadu Buhari to wade into the raging hijab controversy in Kwara State. President of the group, Alhaji Aliyu Otta Uthman, made the appeal at a press conference in Ilorin, the state capital. The union asked President Buhari to prevail on the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, to allow the unique harmonious coexistence and peace for which Ilorin people are well known to subsist. The union president, explained that it chose to remain silent on the controversial hijab wearing by female Muslim students in the state, as the state government was making efforts to resolve the complaints of some Christians due to its stance on non interference in governmental decisions. “Hijab for willing Muslim schoolgirls should not be the basis for the current crisis,” the union president added. “We are very much aware of the constitutional rights of Nigerian citizens to pursue and practice any faith of their choice and to conduct themselves in accordance with the tenets of such religion,” he stated. Uthman expressed grave concern over the threat of violence by some demonstrators, adding that, ” If such individuals could resist a legitimately issued directive of a constituted authority, and deliberately take the law into their hands, one gets more worried about the safety of lives and properties in the community.” Uthman said the decision of an Ilorin high court and the subsisting Court of Appeal’s judgement affirming the right of the Muslim girl child to adorn the hijab in any public place in Nigeria as entrenched in Nigeria’s constitution, are also in the public domain.
