The Police have arrested Muhammad Abba, who was exposed by his wife for looting women’s shoes during the Monday inferno at the Katsina Central Market. The Public Relations Officer, Gambo Isah, told newsmen that 33 other persons suspected to have looted traders’ wares were also arrested. Abba, 43, was accused of stealing seven pairs of women’s shoes during the incident and keeping them in his house. The wife, after trying in vain to get her husband to return the shoes, reported him to the Police. Abba claimed he picked the shoes on the road in the market and thought it was lost property. Other looted items include power generators, clothing materials, wall clocks, cartons of spaghetti, bags of Semovita flour, cartons of milk, plastics, carpets. “We have reports that some people are still in possession of such looted items, particularly within Katsina metropolis.” The Police, however, appealed to residents to report such hoodlums to the nearest station for necessary action. All the suspects in custody would soon be charged to court.
