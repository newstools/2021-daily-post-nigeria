Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Osun State, Mr. Sunday Bisi has enjoined residents of Osun State to set aside all differences and rise in unison to rescue the state from the brinks of insolvency. Mr. Bisi made the call while reacting to the judgement of the appeal court sitting in Akure which affirmed him as chairman of the party in Osun State. The Osun PDP chairman called on leaders and members of the party in particular to see the Appeal Courtâ€™s judgement as a challenge to all in the party to live up to the expectation of the electorate as that is the only hope of returning succour and sanity to the state. Mr. Bisi also promised to double his efforts in reconciling all interests in the party for the sake of lasting peace and tranquillity. DAILY POST reports that the Appeal Court in Akure had on Friday set aside the order of a state High Court in Osun State and affirmed Sunday Bisi as chairman of the party in the state, dismissing all grounds of objections by the erstwhile chairman, Soji Adagunodo.
