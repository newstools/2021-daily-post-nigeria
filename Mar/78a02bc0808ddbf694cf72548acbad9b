The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said the number of new global cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has risen over the past week after a long decline. WHO said more than 2.6 million new cases were reported last week, a seven per cent increase compared to the previous week, following six consecutive weeks of declining numbers. “The global case increase was driven by increases in the Eastern Mediterranean, 14 per cent ; South-East Asia, 9 per cent, Europe, 9 per cent and the Americas, 6 per cent.” It said possible reasons for the increase includes continued spread of more transmissible variants of concern (VOCs), relaxation of public health and social measures (PHSM) and fatigue around adhering to PSHM measures. WHO, however, added that the weekly death toll figures kept decreasing. “The number of global new deaths continue to decrease, with more than 63,000 new deaths reported last week, a 6 per cent decrease as compared to the previous week,” it said Meanwhile, Nigeria’s total COVID-19 cases hit 156,496 on Tuesday. So far, the country has only recorded 1,923 fatalities. It also received its first batch of COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday.
