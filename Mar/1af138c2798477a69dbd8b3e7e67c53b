Controversial On-Air Personality, Ifedayo Olarinde, popularly known as Daddy Freeze, has reacted to a court ruling asking him to pay the sum of N5m for committing adultery with his lover, Benedicta Elechi. A High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, recently ordered Daddy Freeze, to pay the sum of N5m for sleeping with a woman who was still legally married when the said sex happened. Reacting in a video on his Youtube channel, Daddy Freeze said the court judgment was obtained in his absence. He said the judgement came as a surprise to him just as many of his fans were when they heard the verdict. However, he said he would be approaching the Appeal Court to seek a fair judgement. He said, “Many of you would have been surprised as I was to wake up one morning and see a judgement from a Rivers State High Court. Well, the court never served me, so the judgement was obtained in my absence. “What we will do now is go straight to the Appeal Court. A lot of people are unaware that the judgement is not final until it gets to the Supreme Court. “I’m very confident in the judiciary system, and I do believe that I will receive a fair judgement.”
