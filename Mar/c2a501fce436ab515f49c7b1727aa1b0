The House of Representatives on Tuesday urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to review the federal constituencies and senatorial districts. The green chamber made the call following a motion by the Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu on Wednesday. Elumelu in his motion said INEC had failed to comply with section 73 subsections a and b of the 1999 Constitution. He noted that INEC is yet to review the existing constituencies and senatorial districts since the return of democracy, despite the constitution providing that INEC should make such reviews every 10 years. “It is more than 10 years since the return of democracy and INEC is yet to make a review,” he said. Elumelu noted that the motion is only calling on INEC to perform its duties as provided in the constitution. The motion was taken when it was put to question by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila.
