Former Governor of Ogun State, Gbenga Daniel, has dismissed the assertion in some quarters that the All progressives Congress, APC, was trying to create a one-party state by fishing for members of other political parties. Daniel, who met with President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday, pointed out that when the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, was in the same position as APC, the country was not a one party state. He said: “Definitely, any political environment, whether it is multi-party or two party, there will usually be a majority party and the minority party. “So I don’t think that there’s anything new that has happened. “A few years ago, when PDP was at the helm of affairs at the centre, I think the last count out of the 36 states, PDP was in charge in more than 24 states at that time, and the country did not become a one party state. “So I think what is going on is quite healthy. The contestation is quite exciting,” NAN quoted him as saying.
