The Barcelona defender, Victor Semedo, has revealed that Argentina superstar, Lionel Messi, does not train for free-kicks. Semedo spoke about Messi’s ‘natural’ ability from set-pieces, insisting the Argentina captain never practises free kicks. According to Semedo, Messi has always been “perfect” when it comes to picking out the corner of the net from long range. Semedo, who is currently on a season-long loan spell at Wolves, told The Telegraph, “Wow. I really don’t have many words that can describe how good he is,” when asked what it feels like working with Messi. “You know what makes him even more amazing? I never once saw him take a free kick in training, in all of the time I was there. I swear he never did! “We always used to practise shooting from distance but Messi never took a free kick. For him, it was just natural. “They say practice makes perfect – with him it was no practice and it was still perfect!”
