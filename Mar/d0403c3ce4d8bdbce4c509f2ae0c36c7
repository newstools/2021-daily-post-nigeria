Juventus boss, Andrea Pirlo, has confirmed that his side will be without four key players when they face Cagliari in an away Serie A fixture on Sunday evening. The four players are Aaron Ramsey, Merih Demiral, Paulo Dybala and Rodrigo Bentancur. Pirlo said this on Friday during his pre-match press conference ahead of Juventus’s clash with Cagliari. Juventus head to the game after they were knocked out from the Champions League by FC Porto on Tuesday night in Italy. “Tomorrow we’ll be without Aaron Ramsey, Merih Demiral, Paulo Dybala, and Rodrigo Bentancur will be missing,” Pirlo said as quoted by Juventus’s official website. “Giorgio Chiellini could play from the first minute. Dejan Kulusevski is a very young player who still has ample room for improvement both from a technical and tactical point of view. He is a player capable of playing in different roles and could also be used in a more central position in midfield. “Based on the tactics we want to adopt in the next games, he could also be deployed in this position.” The kick-off time for the match is 6 pm.
