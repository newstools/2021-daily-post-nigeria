The Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello has given a possible reason why the Peoples Democratic Party chieftain, Fani-Kayode, refused to dump the party for the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC. Bello who was a guest on Channels TV on Saturday said Fani-Kayode had a rethink of what life and Nigeria are all about. Recall that Yahaya Bello had last month confirmed Femi Fani-Kayode’s intention to join APC. koiHowever, after several reconciliation meetings with the PDP National Working Committee, NWC, the former Aviation Minister said leaving PDP was never an option. He had said, ”Whatever issues there may have been, have been resolved. We are moving forward as one. I never left the PDP. I am in PDP and I am proud to be here.” Bello in reaction to Kayode’s statements said, he and Fani-Kayode are brothers and are partnering to ensure there is peace and tranquillity in Nigeria. “The Chief Femi Fani-Kayode that everybody knows by the time he met me, I think he had a rethink of what life is all about and what Nigeria is all about, and you can see the mix so far, we are able to broker peace between the Amalgamated Union of Traders and our other aggrieved brothers. “Him joining the APC is at his own volition; him not joining, is at his own volition, political party divide has nothing to do with both of us working for the unity, peace and progress of this country, that’s what I know,” he added.
