About 55 persons were on Monday arraigned before a Mobile Court in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja for violating COVID-19 protocols. The presiding Magistrate, Ebiwari Eremasi, after the trial, convicted the violators. The magistrate fined the offenders with N2,000 with an option of community service worth the amount. Meanwhile, Ebiwari Eremasi, ordered that one of the convicts be remanded in correctional centre for earlier attempting to obstruct the court proceedings. The Magistrate advised the convicts to always adhere to COVID-19 protocols for the safety of themselves and others. In another development, the Head, Media, Publicity and Enlightenment of the FCT COVID-19 Regulations Enforcement Task Force, Mr Ikharo Attah, while addressing newsmen shortly after the court proceedings, said the offenders were arrested from different parts of the territory mostly for not wearing face masks. According to him: “We went round the town and made 55 arrests and brought them before the court. “We decided to strengthen the enforcement because we understood that after the vaccines arrived, and the first doses were given to health workers on Friday and Saturday, we have seen a relaxation in compliance with COVID-19 protocols. “So, we are appealing to people to ensure that they comply with the COVID-19 Health Protocols.”
