Chelsea hero, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, has expressed confidence that the club would secure a top-four finish under their manager, Thomas Tuchel, this season. Chelsea are currently in the fifth position on the Premier League table with a point behind fourth-place West Ham after 26 matches. Asked if Chelsea will finish top-four, Hasselbaink told Sky Sports: “I’m more convinced that Chelsea will make it because at the moment, they don’t get any goals against and that is a big thing. “They only need to score one goal to win matches. They are not getting counter-attacked that much. “Also, they are not getting goals against set-pieces, so in that aspect, it’s good. “Against Manchester United, they got the best chance in the game, and I still believe Chelsea will be in the top four.” Chelsea’s next game is against Liverpool on Thursday at Anfield.
