Spain coach, Luis Enrique, has said that he was “on the verge of a heart attack” after his team needed a last-minute winner to beat Georgia in their World Cup qualification on Sunday. Spain played out a draw with Greece in their opening qualification game against Greece on Thursday and looked set for another frustrating evening in Tbilisi as the game entered stoppage-time with the scores level at 1-1. However, midfielder, Dani Olmo came to their rescue with a shot from distance to give the former World Cup winners a 2-1 win Enrique told TVE after the game, “I was on the verge of a heart attack. We have been losing confidence and you could see that in the first half. “We conceded from a slight defensive error and knew it would be complicated from that point on. Our intention was to play more passes inside and create more opportunities.” Asked if Spain deserved their victory against a side ranked 83 places below them in the FIFA rankings, Enrique added: “Yes. And if people think we don’t then I do not care.”
