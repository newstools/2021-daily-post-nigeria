The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) says Kwara Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, should be held responsible if the crisis over hijab wearing in schools degenerates. On Wednesday, CAN urged the Federal Government and the Inspector General of Police to intervene in the violence over the hijab policy. The General Secretary, Joseph Bade Daramola, in a statement said it was AbdulRazaq’s pronouncement on hijab “in violation of the court directive on the matter to maintain status quo until the matter is finally resolved by the court that led to this trouble”. The scribe noted that the state government ordered the reopening of the closed schools without resolving the crisis. Daramola said churches and mission schools are being vandalised with impunity by those “banking on the state government’s support in the pretext of enforcing the policy”. The Christian leadership decried that innocent Christians are being violently abused and attacked “under the watch of the Governor who is playing ostrich”. CAN said wisdom is required by those in leadership to handle sensitive issues such as that of religion so as not to precipitate war. “It is disheartening and unfortunate that a government that was installed democratically will become insensitive to the plight and the yearning of the people as if the governor was voted into the office primarily to protect his religion. This is unfair, ungodly and reprehensible. “There are public schools and schools that belong to some Islamic organisations where those who wanted to be wearing hijab can be attending without causing the ongoing needless crises rocking the state.” The statement advised AbdulRazaq to order “his hoodlums to stop attacking mission schools and churches before the situation degenerates into an unprecedented religious crisis.”
