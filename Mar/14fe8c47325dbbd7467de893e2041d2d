Some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo State have protested the alleged imposition of candidates ahead of the local government election in the state. The protesting members stormed Oyo State Secretariat in Agodi Ibadan to kick against the imposition of candidates on them. Some of the members from Oyo East Local Government took the protest to the Oyo State Governor’s Office, Agodi Secretariat, Ibadan on Friday. The protesters are kicking against the alleged imposition of candidates for the planned local government election slated for May. They carried placards, chanting solidarity songs to express their displeasures. The protesters alleged that leaders of the party were planning to impose some ‘unpopular candidates’ who have already served as caretaker Chairmen. The protesters insisted on the party conducting a primary election to give all candidates a level playing ground. Some of the inscriptions on their placards read “Oyo East LG says no to imposition”, “Oyo East PDP wants to pry election please”, “LG Primary election save us from imposition in Oyo East LG Council”, “We want a free and fair primary election. We want free, fair primary election”. Others read “Oyo state PDP elders and stakeholders flashback, remember what killed PDP. They don’t wish the masses well”, “We say no to the imposition of candidate”, “Don’t open the door for mass defection ahead of 2023 Oyo East local government PDP warns” and “Imposition kills the party, don’t use it” among others. Publicity Secretary of PDP, Engineer Akeem Olatunji when contacted denied the allegations, claiming there was nothing like an imposition. He said he and the chairman of the party had addressed the protesters. Olatunji said, “There is nothing like that. The party chairman addressed them and I also addressed them. Virtually, everybody was happy. What we did is to appeal to the aspirants to see themselves as one family. “Nobody is forcing anyone on anybody.”
