A Bayelsa State High Court sitting in Yenagoa has sentenced a 50-year-old, electrical engineer to 5 years in jail for the serial rape of his 17 years old sister-in-law. The accused whose name was given as Preye Ojoko, a father of five, was accused of raping his wife’s niece at the age of 9 till she reached 17 years under the pretence of training her in school. The prosecuting counsel, Kemesuode Wodu Esq told the Court that the accused started the serial rape of his inlaw when she was 9 years but she was rescued and taken back to her village after the initial discovery by the wife, who is a Vice Principal in one of the public schools in the state. The accused, after convincing his wife that he has changed for good, lured the unsuspecting victim back to the House saying he was ready to support her university education. The accused resumed his serial rape of the now 17 years old girl until she complained to her Guidance Counsellor who later reported to the school’s Principal, who in turn raised alarm and reported the case to the International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) in the state. The Presiding Judge, Justice T.Y. Abasi after listening to the submissions of the prosecution counsel, Kemesuode Wodu and the Defence Attorney, Stanley Damabide Esq, sentenced the accused to five years in jail. Reacting to the development, the Acting Chairperson of FIDA in Bayelsa State, Ebimietei Ekeowei Ottah, described the hearing and ruling of the Court as swift and commendable,” the judicial system was swift, fast and helped in passing a quick message to other rapists that the law is now on the side of the victims of rape and defilement. Ottah, also expressed concern over the issue of settlement out of court by parents of rape victims in the state,” it is pathetic that some parents will negotiate the future of their children to money. In the last two months, we have recorded five cases of defilement and three cases of rape from December last year till March this year,2021.”
