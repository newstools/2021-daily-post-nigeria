Chelsea have reportedly identified Bayern Munich winger, Kingsley Coman, as Christian Pulisic’s replacement at Stamford Bridge. Pulisic, who has fallen out of favour under manager, Thomas Tuchel, is yet to start a game under the Blues boss. The United States international only joined Chelsea in 2019 from Dortmund. According to the Daily Mail, Coman tops Chelsea’s list of possible options to take Pulisic’s place at the West London club. Chelsea have been keeping tabs on the France international for some time. Coman has two years left on his current deal with Bayern Munich. The 24-year-old, who scored the winner in last season’s Champions League final, is believed to be keen on a transfer away from Bayern Munich and has not expressed any interest in extending his contract with the Bundesliga champions. Coman recently opened the door to a move to the Premier League when he was being linked to Manchester United and Manchester City. “It’s good to know that good teams are interested in me, it gives me additional confidence,” Coman said last January.
