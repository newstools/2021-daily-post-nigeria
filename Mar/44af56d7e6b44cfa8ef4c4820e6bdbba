The police in Ogun State have arrested six persons for allegedly unleashing terror on Ikenne Remo area of Ogun State. The fracas, police said, followed a protracted Obaship tussle, which is presently a subject of litigation. It was gathered that crisis broke out in the town on Friday, as the reigning Oba of the town, Oba Onakade, decided to celebrate a traditional festival known as ‘Jabajaba’. The monarch was said to have sent his town crier round the community for the preparatory rites. But, police said this did not go down well with the opposing side, who allegedly attacked the town crier and seized his gong. The Ogun State Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the people accused the monarch of trying to forcefully fence off a piece of land where traditional rites are being performed in the town. Oyeyemi disclosed that a riot broke out between the two parties. DAILY POST learnt that many sustained injuries and some houses were vandalised. A team of policemen led by the Area Commander of Sagamu was quickly deployed to bring the situation under control. On Saturday, the Ogun Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, was in Ikenne for an on-the-spot assessment and a peace talk. However, when the CP and his entourage were still on the peace mission within the town, it was learnt that some people suspected to be hired thugs and Agbekoyas, (popular Yoruba hunters group), were shooting sporadically to retaliate the alleged vandalisation of their property. In the process, four persons were reportedly injured, causing the CP to order that they should be chased and brought to book. Six of the suspects were apprehended. They are: Oluwashina Kafisanwo, Olasunkanmi Enigbokan, Lawal Adebayo, Suraju Animashun, Olusegun Odukoya, and Qudus Mabadeje. Oyeyemi said they were arrested with dangerous weapons and assorted charms, adding that they have confessed to the offence.
