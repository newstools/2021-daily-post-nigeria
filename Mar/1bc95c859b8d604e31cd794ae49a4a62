AC Milan striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, has insisted that athletes should “stick to sports”. Ibrahimovic was addressing comments aimed at Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James. Speaking in a news conference Tuesday ahead of the start of the Italian music festival Sanremo, he said: “Athletes unite the world, politics divide it. “Our role is to unite the world by doing what we do best. Athletes should be athletes and politicians should do politics.” Last week, Ibrahimovic had told LeBron to stay away from politics. The comments prompted a response from James, who said he speaks “from a very educated mind, so I’m kind of the wrong guy to actually go at, because I do my homework.”
