Suspected bandits have attacked the Emir of Birnin Gwari in Kaduna State, Alhaji Zubairu Jibril Maigwari, while travelling along Kaduna-Abuja expressway. As at the time filing this report, it is not clear the number of casualties from the incident, though a number of persons were said to have been injured. The bandits are said to have shot at the Emirâ€™s convoy on Tuesday, destroying his vehicles with bullets. The report explained that he (Emir) was on his way to Kaduna from Abuja when the incident happened. The Emir is said to be one of the top traditional rulers who held a virtual meeting with the State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, only last week when the recurring crisis of banditry ravaging the state was discussed.
