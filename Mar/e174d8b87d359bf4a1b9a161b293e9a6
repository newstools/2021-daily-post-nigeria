Juventus boss, Andrea Pirlo, has provided update on forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, ahead of his side’s Champions League last-16 second-leg tie against Porto on Tuesday night in Turin. Ronaldo is set to return to Juventus starting line-up as the Serie A champions look to overturn a 2-1 deficit in the second leg against Porto. The Portugal captain was only a substitute for Juventus’ 3-1 victory against Lazio on Saturday. Providing an update on Ronaldo during his pre-match press conference on Monday, Pirlo said the 36-year-old was just being rested, adding that he is ‘fired up’ for the Porto clash. “Cristiano is fine. These are his matches. He’s fired up,” Pirlo said. “He’s been able to rest and can’t wait. “We know the pressure is on us, but we don’t hide. We have what it takes to go through, but we don’t underestimate our opponents. However, we are Juventus and have to think about qualifying.”
