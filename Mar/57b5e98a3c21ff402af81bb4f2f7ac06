The English Premier League, EPL, has explained the decision not to award Arsenal a penalty in Saturday’s clash against Burnley at Turf Moor. Arsenal was angry in the 75th minute when Nicolas Pepe’s touch inside Burnley’s box led the ball to hit Erik Pieters’ outstretched arm, but the Gunners were not awarded a penalty following a VAR review. Two goals from Chris Wood and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gave both teams a point each. However, the Premier League has now issued a statement on the matter, which read: “The ball hit him from close proximity and he had no time to react. “It was not given on-field, and the VAR did not think it was a clear error.” The result against Burnley means Arsenal are now in the tenth position on the EPL log with 38 points from 27 games. Arsenal’s next game is against Olympiacos in the Europa League last-16 first-leg tie on Thursday.
