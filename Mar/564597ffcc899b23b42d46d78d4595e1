One Hafsat Anka, a victim of Zamfara Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe, abduction, has disclosed that their abductors threatened to kill, fry and eat them if they misbehaved. Shortly after regaining freedom, Hafsat told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that they trekked over a long distance from the school, and had a stopover for some hours before they reached their destination. The student who said she would continue her studies as a day student revealed that the bandits wore military uniforms and claimed they defeated the security officials by invading the school. “There was no clean water or good food, and we felt we had already spent years even though it was our first day and the bandits kept firing into the air to scare us. “They were very young boys with one elder they called Kasalle or Yaya who gave them instructions, and he was the one that stopped them from touching any of us,” Hafsat added.
