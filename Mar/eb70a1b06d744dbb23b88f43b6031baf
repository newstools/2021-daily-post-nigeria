The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, said it has discovered that the newly confirmed Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Mr Abdulraheed Bawa, is the first trained investigator to have chaired the Commission. The party stated this in a statement issued on Sunday by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan. PDP, while urging Bawa to avoid the pitfalls of his immediate predecessor, also advised the new Chairman to re-engineer and restore professionalism in the anti-graft agency. Ologbondiyan urged Bawa not to succumb to pressures that may arise from politicians while he discharges his duty. According to him, such tendencies have the capacity to erode professionalism in the Commission, and reduce the confidence the public imposed on it. Ologbondiyan noted that the EFCC was established to fight corruption and not as a tool for oppression and intimidation of innocent Nigerians for political and other unjustified reasons. “The PDP notes that for the first time, the Chairman of the EFCC is drawn from the pool of trained investigators of the commission.” He also stated that Nigerians are looking up to the new EFCC boss to bring change to the Commission and restore professionalism in line with international standard.
