The Presidency has said Nigerians will be informed if ransom was paid to secure the release of abducted students. President Muhammadu Buhari’s spokesman, Femi Adesina disclosed this while noting that the President can not pay ransom to effect release of students. Appearing on Channels Television, Adesina said if ransom would be paid, there are agencies to carryout such not the President. He said: “If ransom was paid, we will tell the country that ransom was paid, and if it is not paid, it would also say so. “If there was payment, it would be disclosed. That is what I’m saying, and if there was payment, it will not be my duty, because I speak for the president. “The president will not be the one to pay the ransom. The agencies that would pay the ransom have spokesmen, who can confirm or deny if ransoms were paid.” Kidnapping and banditry in the Northern part of the country have been on the increase lately. States like Zamfara, Niger, Katsina have witnessed activities of banditry, with the abduction of school students. On Tuesday morning, the abducted students of Government Girls’ Secondary School in Jangebe, Zamfara State were released.
