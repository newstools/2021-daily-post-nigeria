The security situation in the country has been described as precarious and in a bid to counter it, there is the need to always tread carefully so as not to fall victim. Also, citizens have been admonished to remain alert and vigilant at all times and also take seriously the responsibility of their own safety. This charge was given by Joseph Komolafe, a Retired General in the Nigerian Army while addressing members of the 2021 Batch A Stream 1 Prospective Corps Members (PCMs) of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) posted to Osun State. He disclosed that some of the security challenges confronting the nation included kidnapping, banditry, terrorism, armed robbery, cyber crimes, amongst many others. General Komolafe maintained that the situation is so bad that there is no single state in the country that does not have one security challenge it is dealing with at the moment. He encouraged the corps members to imbibe good social skills as this will prove vital in times of distress. “I want to encourage you to develop courage and self-confidence as these will help you in assessing situations logically, thereby, avoiding giving in to emotional whims and fads. “Also, develop cordial relationships with security agencies because they may come in handy should you find yourselves in distress. “I want you to cultivate the culture of gratitude and respect to all and sundry even as you go through this phase of life”, he added.
