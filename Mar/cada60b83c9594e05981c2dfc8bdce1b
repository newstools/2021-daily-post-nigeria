President Muhammadu Buhari has told the new service chiefs decorated on Friday, that they have only a few weeks to secure the country. Buhari said he expected it to happen before the rainy season, so that farmers who abandoned their farms in different parts of Nigeria, can be confident to return. The president gave the charge shortly after decorating the new service chiefs with their new ranks at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Buhari said, “It is up to you to identify your competent officers irrespective of seniority and paper qualification and deploy them to make sure that we secure this country. “You have got a few weeks to do that. Because, by the rainy season, we expect people to develop confidence and go back to the land, so we don’t get into trouble by being away from the field and therefore unable to produce enough food for the nation.” Those decorated with new ranks include the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor; Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu; and Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amoo; Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant-General Ibrahim Attahiru; Chief of Naval Staff.
