Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike has described Grammy award-winning Afrobeat singer, Burna Boy as the pride of the state. Wike said this while welcoming Burna Boy, his parents on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Port Harcourt on Saturday. The state organised a homecoming ceremony for Burna Boy after his album ‘ Twice as Tall’ won Best Global Music Album category. The governor encouraged Burna Boy to continue making the state proud even as he promised to do anything to promote him. Wike said: “There is no Rivers person that will say he or she is not happy with the kind of pride you have brought to us. I am very happy and I can tell you, whatever you think we can do to promote you, we will continue to do it.” Wike noted that when news broke that Burna Boy was the winner in the Best Global Music Album category with his Twice As Tall album, the entire state was elated and he was happy. “Do not relent in your musical endeavour as we will continue to give you all the necessary support required. “You’ve done us proud and we owe you a duty to show you, love. Wherever you are, your people appreciate you,” Wike added.
