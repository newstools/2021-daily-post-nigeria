The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has commended the judiciary for convicting a Returning Officer, who connived with the All Progressives Congress, APC, to rewrite election during the 2019 general elections. PDP said the “three years jailed term handed to Prof. Peter Ogban, a professor of University of Calabar, for manipulating the result of Akwa-Ibom Northwest senatorial election in favour of Gods will Akpabio was a huge lesson for compromised individuals working to subvert the will of the people.’ The former ruling party stated this in a series of tweets via its official Twitter handle. According to PDP: “The @OfficialPDPNig asserts that the long arm of the law will soon catch up with other corrupt returning officers, including some shameless professors who were heavily bribed and compromised by the
@OfficialAPCNg to alter results and rig it into power at various levels in the 2019 general elections. “It is shameful that individuals who had attained the peak of enviable career in the academia could submit themselves as willing tools in the hands of a fraudulent, debased and manipulative political party, like the @OfficialAPCN, to alter election results and subvert the collective will of the people in the 2019 elections.”
