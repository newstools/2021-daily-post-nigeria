The Supreme Court on Thursday responded to a petition reportedly filed by the All Progressives Congress APC (APC) on the Imo North Senatorial bye-election. APC chairman and Yobe State Governor, Mai Buni, allegedly accused Justice Abdul Aboki and two other judges of plotting to subvert justice in the matter. Justice Musa Dattijo Mohammed made the petition public during court proceedings on Tuesday. Mohammed mentioned himself, Aboki and Helen Morenikeji Ogunwumiju as the three Justices accused of working with Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leaders. In a rejoinder on Thursday, Supreme Court Information Director, Fesus Akande, stated that the name of Aboki was not included. Akande said Aboki “was never mentioned…even though he is on the panel of five Justices hearing the appeal that resulted from the election”. Noting that Bunu has denied the petition, Akande told litigants and politicians to “be guided by good conscience and decency in all their conducts especially when a case is before a court of competent jurisdiction”. The spokesman added that Supreme Court Justices work assiduously to promote the rule of law, impartial and seamless dispensation of justice and “do not deserve orchestrated mudslinging”.
