Prince Harry’s wife, Meghan Markle, has admitted she contemplated committing suicide after joining the royal family. Meghan also raised allegations of racism in the monarchy during an explosive television interview with Oprah on Sunday. She also claimed there was official concern about the skin color of her unborn son. Meghan, whose father is white and mother is Black, said: “I… just didn’t want to be alive anymore. And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought,” she told Winfrey, describing the impact of a torrent of vitriol from hostile tabloids and social media. Asked if she had had suicidal thoughts while pregnant, Meghan replied “Yes. This was very, very clear.” Recalling how she felt at the time, she said that “I’m scared, because this is very real.” Meghan, 39, also told of royal “concerns” about “how dark” her son’s skin would be. “In those months when I was pregnant… we have in tandem the conversation of ‘he won’t be given security, he’s not going to be given a title’ and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he’s born,” Meghan said. “That was relayed to me from Harry, those were conversations the family had with him,” she said.
