Speaking German, Tuchel was telling that Werner that he was playing on the left whereas he was supposed to be playing on the right. “Timo, how long are you staying on the left? You’re playing on the right! The last 15 mins you’ve only been on the left! Don’t you understand?” The manager shouted, according to Daily Mail.
