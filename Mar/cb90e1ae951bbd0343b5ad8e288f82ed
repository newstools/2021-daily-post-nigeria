The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to explain why his administration is vaccinating Nigerians without addressing salient issues such as insecurity, hunger and unemployment. Pastor Giwa urged Buhari to suspend the exercise and tackle major issues affecting Nigerians. He made the call in a statement he forwarded to Daily Post on Wednesday. He said,” I wish whoever is taking COVID-19 vaccination the best of luck. “However, let me tell President Muhammadu Buhari that vaccination is not the problem confronting Nigerians. “Rather, the president should swing into action and quickly address insecurity, hunger, injustice and unemployment. Boko Haram, Fulani herdsmen and other terrorist groups have killed thousands of innocent Nigerians without the government bringing them to justice. “COVID-19 in Nigeria only affects the rich while politicians see it as another avenue to enrich their pockets. When Nigerians were crying for help during the lockdown, where was president Buhari? “Anything free coming from this government is evil, and those who are wise should know better. President Buhari should tell us the free gift he has offered Nigerians since 2015 other than watching his kinsmen to continue terrorizing the people “I know that God does not forsake those who speak the truth which I shall continue to stand for. Nigerians don’t deserve vaccination but they deserve security, justice and good governance.”
