Teachers and staff of ten mission schools in Ilorin, shut down by the Kwara State government over the hijab controversy, reported for work on Friday in compliance with the government’s directive. Recall that the Chairman, state Teaching Service Commission, TESCOM, Malam Bello Tahueed, on Thursday, directed the teachers and staff of the affected schools to report for work or face the full weight of the law. DAILY POST reports that though the staff reported to work as early as 8am there were not many activities in the schools, as students did not turn up in large numbers as expected. Parents who spoke to DAILY POST said their decision not to release their children was based on security reasons. Some of the ten mission schools locked up by their proprietors were forced open to allow staff and students to resume as directed by the state government. At St Anthony’s College Offa Road, government agents broke the chain and padlocks were used in locking the gate. However, the teachers and staff of most of the mission schools visited were seen in groups discussing the issue at hand. Our correspondent reports that the ten mission schools were closed down over the hijab issue and asked to resume on March 17, 2021. The reopening was extended again for security reasons by the government following resistance by the Christian community not to allow Muslim girls to use hijab in the mission schools. The government, however, directed the schools to resume again on Friday to allow intended WASC students prepare for their examinations, with a warning to teachers and staff to report for duty or face the consequences. The ten affected schools are, C&S College Sabo Oke; St Anthony College Offa Road; ECWA School, Oja Iya; Surulere Baptist School; Bishop Smith Secondary School, Agba Dam; CAC Secondary School, Asa Dam; St Barnabas Secondary School, Sabo Oke; St John School, Maraba; St Williams Secondary School, Taiwo Isale; and St James Secondary School, Maraba.
