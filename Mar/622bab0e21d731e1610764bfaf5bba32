People of 30 farming communities in Girei Local Government Area of Adamawa State have accused their council chairman of selling their farmlands. The farmers took their protest to Yola on Thursday, alleging that the Girei LGA Chairman, Judah Amisa, had sold many acres of farmlands belonging to them and had marked lots of other acres to be sold. The protesters carried placards reading, ‘Our farms are not for sale,’ ‘Our lands are our livelihood,’ ‘We’re not ready to surrender our farms,’ among others. Leader of the aggrieved farmers, Ahijo Yakubu, who read a message to newsmen at the NUJ Press Centre in Yola, said he had earlier led the farmers to the state House of Assembly.  He added that at the Assembly, “We expressed our grievances to our lawmakers.” Ahijo Yakubu accused Judah Amisa of allegedly selling 10 hectares of their land to a councillor and demarcating 500 other hectares for sale to other people. He said, “The lands in question are individual farmlands for the use of poor people who are mostly farmers. The council boss is in the habit of selling our land to some group and we are being threatened.” Responding to the allegations, the Girei council chairman told newsmen over the phone that the farmlands in question were demarcated as Government Reserved Area which he could not sell to anybody. “The protesters should verify their claims with the state Ministry of Environment, Land and Survey,” Judah Amisa urged.
