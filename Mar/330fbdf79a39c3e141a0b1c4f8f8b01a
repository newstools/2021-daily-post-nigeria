Borussia Dortmund striker, Erling Haaland, has surpassed Tottenham’s Harry Kane’s Champions League goal record. Haaland became the quickest player to score 20 Champions League goals in the competition’s history on Tuesday night when he scored two goals in his side’s 2-2 draw with Sevilla as Dortmund qualified for the last-8 on 5-4 aggregate. Haaland’s brace against Sevilla means he has now scored ten goals in the Champions League this season, adding to the same amount he scored last term, taking his tally to 20 in just 14 games for Dortmund and Red Bull Salzburg. The previous quickest to 20 Champions League goals was Kane, who got there in 24 games. Kane had beaten a long-held record held by Alessandro del Piero at 26 games. Reacting to Haaland’s new record, a former Liverpool striker, Peter Crouch, told BT Sport, “It’s 20 goals, he’s beaten Harry Kane’s record by ten games! At the age of 20, he’s knocking over senior international players, walking through them like they’re not there, banging them in every game, it’s frightening.”
