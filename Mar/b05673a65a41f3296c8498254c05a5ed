Popular Nigerian actor, Ime Bishop Umoh, also known as Okon Lagos, has expressed worry over Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s relationship. Recall that Prince Harry had stepped down his Royal responsibilities and relocated to the US with his wife, Meghan Markle after she accused his family of being ‘racist’. Their recent interview with Oprah has been debated online for the last 24hours, as Meghan revealed how her son’s skin colour was a major concern for the royal family. However, Okon in a post via his Instagram account said he hopes what his mind is telling him doesn’t manifest in their relationship. He also wondered what will happen if Meghan divorces Prince Harry. According to him, Meghan is “older, was married before, street wiser, more experienced.” He, however, advised people not to fall in love with someone who “stands to lose nothing” when they themselves stand to “lose everything. ” “This Harry and Meghan matter, I truly hope Wetin my mind no manifest o. “I pray for true love, if and only if she has it for Harry wins. I keep wondering what will happen if Meghan divorces Harry. “She’s older, was married before, street-wiser and more experienced. “Meghan is clearly the A-side in the relationship. She’s the river, Harry is the log,” he said.
