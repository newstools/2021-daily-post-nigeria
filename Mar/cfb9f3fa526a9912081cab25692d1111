The Special anti-kidnapping and Cybercrime Squad has arrested five suspected kidnappers in connection with the alleged abduction and murder of a 39-year-old woman, Joy Osameze, a farmer in Obiaruku Community, Delta State. The police squad also recovered from the suspects, a bagco bag containing human skull and other human parts suspected to be that of the victim. The Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Ari Muhammed Ali disclosed this in a statement signed and made available to DAILY POST. The Police boss gave the names of the suspects to include: Emmanuel Ojibe (18yrs, Osam Ogolime (21yrs), Ossai Reuben (22yrs) Odigili Chukwutem (33yrs) and Ukpaka Confidence (20yrs).  He said the suspects abducted the deceased on her way back from farm at Abraka farm reserve on 05/02/2021. CP Ali said the confession of one of the suspects Emmanuel Ojibi on 07/03/2021 led to the arrest of the trio of one Razaq Ifamaye, ‘m’, age 38yrs, and Gbenga Olawuyi, ‘m’, age 50yrs, both natives of Ekiti State but resident at Old Market Road, Obiaruku and one Samson Oduni, ‘m’, age 31yrs, a native of Obiaruku. According to CP Ali, “Upon interrogation, Razaq Ifamaye, ‘m’, who confessed to the crimes led Police operatives attached to Special Anti-Kidnapping and Cyber Crimes squad to Shegelo Beach, Obiaruku on 09/03/2021 at about 1615hrs where a Baco Bag containing human skull and other human parts suspected to be that of the victim was recovered.” Ali noted that,”One Chikogwu Isaac A.K.A Ikukwu, ‘m’, 38yrs, a native of Obiaruku whose premises the exhibit was found, instigated four (4) others who are now at large to attack the operatives in order to prevent/obstruct the operatives from making the recovery.” He stated that Isaac was, however, arrested just as the human remains were taken to the Agbor General Hospital for autopsy. While noting that the arrested suspects have been transferred to the Squad’s base in Asaba, CP Ali said, “investigation is ongoing.”
