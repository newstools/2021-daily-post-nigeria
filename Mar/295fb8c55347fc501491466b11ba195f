Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said Edinson Cavani should be fit enough for the teams trip to Crystal Palace on Wednesday night. However, Paul Pogba is still unavailable with injury. Cavani has missed the last two league fixtures with a muscle injury but could be in line to return for the trip to Selhurst Park. Pogba continues to recover from a hamstring injury he sustained during the draw with Everton. “There’s a couple of doubts for tomorrow that we will have to give as much time as possible. Edinson has trained, that’s good, let’s hope there’s no reaction after the session and hopefully, he will travel to the squad,” Solskjaer told the media on Tuesday. On Pogba, he added: “Paul is still not ready for us. He’s feeling better but he’s not been training with the team yet so he’s definitely not travelling down to London.”
