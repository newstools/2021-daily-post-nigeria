Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, on Saturday suggested steps the Federal Government should take in resolving the crisis between farmers and herdsmen. Tinubu said the Federal Government should convene a meeting between state governors, security operatives, herdsmen, farmers, and traditional rulers over the lingering crisis. He said the government and the relevant stakeholders should work out principles aimed at resolving the persistent crisis. The former Lagos State governor disclosed this in a statement he signed and forwarded to DAILY POST. According to Tinubu: “Based on these strategic observations, I recommend the federal government convene a meeting of state governors, senior security officials, herder and farmer representatives, along with
traditional rulers and religious leaders. “The purpose of this meeting would be to hammer out a set of working principles to resolve the crisis. “After this meeting, governors of each state should convene follow-up meetings in their states to refine and add flesh to the universal principles by adjusting them to the particular circumstances of their states. “In addition to religious and traditional leaders and local farmer and herder representatives, these meetings shall include the state’s best security minds
along with experts in agriculture (livestock and farming), land use and water management to draw specific plans for their states.”
