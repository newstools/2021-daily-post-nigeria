The Police Command in Lagos State says the man allegedly caught in a viral video masturbating in a commercial vehicle is not a policeman. There is a video making the rounds on the internet which shows a man alleged to be a police officer masturbating in a commercial vehicle. The man was also said to have assaulted a lady, one Olajumoke Okeyemi, for correcting his actions. Reacting, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, the states Police Relations Officer (PPRO), in a statement said that the man identified as Mr Matthew, works for GTC Laundry Services. According to him, the man faked being police officer during the “drama’’ in the video. “Mr Matthew resorted to verbal abuse and attempted to physically assault the lady when he noticed she was recording his indecent act on her phone. “Unfortunately, the suspect has also been identified by some other women who had similar experiences with him in previous years and on the same route. “The women involved have made series of statements which will assist the police in their investigation. “Mathew’s careless and unguided utterances has dragged the name of the Nigeria Police Force in the mud and we will ensure that he is severely punished for exhibiting such act. “Also, the Commissioner of Police has ordered the Gender Unit of the Command to begin the case, arrest the suspect and commence proper investigation,’’ Adejobi said.
