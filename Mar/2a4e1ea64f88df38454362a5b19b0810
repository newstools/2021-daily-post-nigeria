The Boko Haram sect has knocked off electricity in Borno State capital, Maiduguri and surrounding towns, the second time in 2021. On Saturday, terrorists vandalised two towers on the Damaturu-Maiduguri 330kiloVolt (KV) Transmission Line. Transmission Company of Nigeria General Manager, Public Affairs, Ndidi Mbah, confirmed the attack in a statement. Mbah said that the incident occurred after TCN made concerted effort and restored power to Maiduguri on March 24. The spokesman disclosed that the explosion recorded at about 5.56 a.m on Saturday, cut power supply to Maiduguri and its environs. “This time, the insurgents bombed two other towers; T152 and T153 on the same line route of the other incident,” she said. The TCN assured that engineers would ensure power supply was restored to the affected areas. Last month, two TCN staff were injured at Mainok in Kaga Local Government Area of Borno State when their vehicle hit a landmine buried by Boko Haram. They were part of a team from the TCN and Yola Electricity Distribution Company (YEDC). The latest sabotage has affected the power outrage the engineers fixed a few days ago.
