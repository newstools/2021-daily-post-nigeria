Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has ruled out any possibility of replacing Joachim Low as Germany head coach this summer. On Tuesday, Low, who led Germany to glory at the 2014 World Cup, announced his decision to step down as Germany head coach after Euro 2020, which is taking place at the end of the season. But Klopp, one of the early favourites to replace Low, says he will not be available to replace Low because he still has a contract with Liverpool. Klopp is currently under intense pressure at Anfield after Liverpool’s sixth consecutive home defeat last Sunday against Fulham. Reacting to the development, Klopp said at his pre-match press conference ahead of Liverpool’s Champions League clash with RB Leipzig on Wednesday: “If I am available for coach of the German national team in the summer? No. After the summer? No. “I have three years left at Liverpool, that is a simple statement, a simple situation. “You sign a contract, and you normally try to stick to that contract don’t you? I had a contract in Mainz where I stuck with them even though there was interest from other Bundesliga teams with more money. “It’s just timing, and if it doesn’t work out, you don’t have to lose any sleep over it. “Jogi Low did an incredible job for so many years. I understand that he wants to have this highlight at the European Championship, try to squeeze everything out that he can in this tournament, and then somebody else will do the job. “Someone else will do the job, and I am pretty sure with the amount of really good German managers at the moment, the German FA will find a good solution.”
