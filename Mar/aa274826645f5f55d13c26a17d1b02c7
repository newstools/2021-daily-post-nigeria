Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has decided he will not take Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang off captaincy duties despite his disciplinary issues last weekend, according to the UK Sun. Aubameyang was dropped to the bench for Arsenal’s Premier League derby win against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday after the striker broke the club’s rules by arriving late to a team meeting ahead of the game. The Gabonese international looked furious on the bench throughout the match at Emirates. He did not also take part in the post-match warm down, choosing to leave the Stadium early instead. Some had suggested Arteta may choose to strip Aubameyang of the captaincy in order to further punish the 31-year-old for his behaviour. However, Arteta considers that the issue has been dealt with and does not wish to take it any further on Aubameyang. The Gunners manager has received praises for his decision to drop Aubameyang, with a number of high-profile figures lauding his leadership skills. Meanwhile, reacting to the development, former Manchester United centre-back, Rio Ferdinand, said: “It was a massive decision from Arteta. It’s the derby, man! Against Spurs, local rivals. “But I think he’s thinking of the bigger picture: ‘I have to make my squad aware and well aware that punctuality, among other things, has to be on point. The captain was late, and he’s going to have to sit like everybody else on the bench for this game, I’m afraid.”
