The Lagos State Federal Medical Centre on Friday commenced the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine as health workers took turns to get the jabs. Dr Adedamola Dada, the Chief Medical Director of the hospital, was the first person to receive the vaccine after going through the registration exercise. Dada who spoke to NAN shortly after receiving the vaccine asked Nigerians not to be hesitant in receiving the vaccine. He said the vaccine which had been certified safe, was a major boost in the fight against coronavirus. “As you have witnessed, I just received my own vaccine and I want other Nigerians to do so because this is the only major way we can defeat this virus. “The vaccine is safe and this exercise is to further keep us safe from COVID-19, this is not the time to spread fake news about the vaccine. “We have also put everything in place here to make the process hitch-free,” he said. A Community Health Officer at Mainland Local Government, Mrs Adetutu Owolabi, told NAN that they were drafted to monitor and ensure a smooth exercise. “We are here as community health workers to make the process seamless and ensure that the right people are vaccinated. “Security personnel are also here with us to safeguard the vaccine as well,” Owolabi said. NAN reports that the vaccine was being administered in three different locations within the hospital to ensure social distancing and make the exercise seamless. Also, three mobile medical vans of the hospital were also stationed in the three locations for the vaccine jabs.
