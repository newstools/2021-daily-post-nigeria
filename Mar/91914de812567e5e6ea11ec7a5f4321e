Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has predicted the position Tottenham Hotspur will finish under their manager, Jose Mourinho, this season. Scholes said that Tottenham would finish in the top four positions this term under Mourinho if the club’s winger, Gareth Bale, remains fit for the remainder of the season. Tottenham are currently in the sixth position on the Premier League table with 45 points from 27 games. Spurs defeated Crystal Palace 4-1 on Sunday, thanks to two goals each from Bale and Harry Kane. “They [Tottenham] look a different team,” Scholes told Premier League Productions. “The threats they have got in those forward areas, as good as anything in the league really. Just behind them is probably the problem. “If you keep him [Bale] fit as I said before, the quality he’s shown throughout his career, at Real Madrid okay he’s been quiet the last couple of years and hasn’t played a lot of games, hasn’t played a lot of football. “But he’s looking fit, he’s looking sharp, it’s not just his goals, but it’s his quality he brings, great left foot switches the play at times. He’s brilliant, and he’s got a lot of confidence. “I think if Tottenham are going to finish in the top four, he’s going to have to have a big part to play, and he’s got to stay fit.”
