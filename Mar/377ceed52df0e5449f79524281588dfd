Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has threatened to expose a “crooked Special Adviser”, who is part of a conspiracy to destabilise Nigeria. According to him, the plan is to ensure that President Muhammadu Buhari declares a state of emergency in 10 states including Zamfara. Fani-Kayode made these allegations on his Twitter page on Saturday night. He wrote: “The conspiracy to destabilise our nation is coming from within. The culprit is a crooked Special Advisor. “The objective is to destabilise 10 states including Zamfara and ensure the President declares a state of emergency in each one. “This man is the enemy within. I will expose him.” Earlier this week, Fani-Kayode had urged Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State to expose those behind the abduction of over 300 students from Government Girls’ Secondary School, Jangebe.
