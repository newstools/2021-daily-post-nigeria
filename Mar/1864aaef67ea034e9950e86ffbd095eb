The House of Representatives has asked the federal governement to reopen Aminu Kano International Airport for international flights. The green chamber also asked FG to open Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu and Port Harcourt International Airport for international flights. This resolution followed a motion moved by the Majority Leader of the House Alhassan Ado Dogwa and 23 others on Wednesday for the reopening of Aminu Kano Airport. However, Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechukwu, moved an amendment for the House to include other international Airports. It would be recalled that airports in the country were shut down on the 23rd of March, 2020 as parts of measures to prevent the spread of COVID19. Lagos and Abuja airports were reopened for international flights on the 5th of August. “On 19 March, 2020, among the urgent drastic responses to COVID-19 pandemic was the closure of three out of the five International Airports in Nigeria namely: Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano, Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu and Port Harcourt International Airport, Omagwa.” He added that the continuous closure of the Kano airport is causing economic and societal hardship on the people. He said the closure is affecting international students in Kano and prevent Nigerians from seeking medical attention outside the country. The House, therefore, resolved to mandate the Committee on Aviation to interface with the Minister of Aviation on the timeline for reopening of the airports
