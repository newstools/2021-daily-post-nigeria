Egyptian forward, Mohamed Salah has put his issues with veteran Spanish defender, Sergio Ramos behind him. Salah spoke ahead of Liverpool’s meeting with Real Madrid on April 6 in the Champions League quarter-finals. The Liverpool winger said he is no longer bothering himself about the shoulder dislocation he suffered after a clash with Ramos in the Champions League final in the 2018 final, which forced him to watch from the dressing room as his side lost 3-1 to the La Liga giants. The north African star said he has devoted himself to securing a better result against Real Madrid this time around. “That game is in the past, so I don’t think about [what happened with Ramos],” Salah told Marca. “I’m thinking about the team. Everyone is focused on their team and everyone wants to win… that’s it. “Let’s just say that I have special motivation to win the tie and go through to the semi-finals. What’s going to happen now isn’t going to change the result of the final in Kyiv. That’s in the past.”
