The UFC has confirmed it will welcome back fans in a mouth-watering UFC 261 fight on April 24 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Kamaru Usman defends his welterweight title against Jorge Masvidal. UFC boss, Dana White, has yearned for the return of fans since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. White has now announced the news on social media. “UFC 261 on April 24 will be in Jacksonville, Florida, with a full house of fans. Full capacity at the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena,” he wrote. White has delivered no fewer than three title fights for the return of fans next month, with Usman facing arch-rival Masvidal for the second time in a year. The pair met on Fight Island last summer, with the welterweight champion defending his crown after Gamebred stepped in last-minute to challenge the title. Masvidal, 36, is looking to dethrone Usman, who is on an impressive 12-fight winning run with the UFC.
