Sterling Bank Plc has assured the Cross River State Government of its continued support and partnership in the implementation of the state’s Health Insurance Scheme tagged Ayade Care. The state government recently launched the scheme in Calabar, as part of an effort to achieve health insurance cover for vulnerable citizens. In his remarks at the launch, Divisional Head, Education and Health Sectors, Sterling Bank, Obinna Ukachukwu, said the state’s pragmatic approach to health insurance was commendable as it differs from the norm experienced in most public service projects. Ukachukwu said he was elated that Governor Ben Ayade, fondly referred to as a ‘digital governor,’ is working on the insurance scheme in partnership with Sterling Bank – the digital bank. “Health is the first pillar of the HEART strategy of Sterling bank. That is why we are very passionate about the sector, especially because of its importance to the development of the economy and to the well-being of Nigerians”, he noted. HEART is an acronym for Health, Education, Agriculture, Renewal Energy and Transportation. The Divisional Head added that the health sector is one of the five key sectors the bank has invested on for many years. He said the Cross River Health Insurance Scheme will be the most digitally enabled state health insurance programme in the country as it runs on the internationally proven Rx Health technology platform. Ukachukwu explained this was made possible through the state’s partnership with a technology consortia led by ICT Health Solutions Limited and Sterling Bank Plc. The official reiterated the bank’s commitment to the scheme and urged the state government to give its maximum support to ensure the purpose of establishment is achieved.
