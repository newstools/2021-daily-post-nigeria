The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has given reasons for the suspension of Azman Air operation with immediate effect. Azman Air had earlier announced the suspension of its operations for safety auditing by the NCAA. But in a statement, NCAA Director-General, Capt. Musa Nuhu said the suspension followed series of incidents involving the Airline’s Boeing 737 Aircraft. The suspension is pursuant to Section 35 (2) of the Civil Aviation Act, 2006 and Part 1.3.3.3 (A) of the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig.CARs) 2015, the DG disclosed. Part of the statement read, “The suspension of Azman Air is to enable us conduct an audit of the airline to determine the root cause(s) of the incidents and recommend corrective actions to forestall re-occurrence. “The NCAA regrets the inconvenience this action may cause to the public, particularly to Azman air passengers but the need to ensure the safety of Air Transport and protect the public interest, cannot be compromised.” NCAA assured the public of its objective to continue to ensure compliance with its regulations in the interest of safety.
