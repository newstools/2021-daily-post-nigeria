Security forces have intercepted notorious bandits and masterminds of recent abductions in some parts of the North. A huge cache of sophisticated weapons was recovered. One of the operations was spearheaded by the Department of State Services (DSS). A forest camp accommodating a network of seven bandit gangs was raided in Kaduna State. The criminals were major attacks, including the kidnapping of students in Niger, Kaduna and Zamfara States. An intelligence source told PRNigeria that security operatives eliminated some of the bandits. The gun duel at Birnin Gwari axis left some with gun wounds; a number of gunrunners were arrested. Another operation was conducted at Pambegua town in Kubau Local Government Area of Kaduna. A general-purpose machine gun, rocket launcher, rocket-propelled grenade, AK 47 rifles and magazines were discovered. The arms were being moved to Birnin Gwari in Kaduna from Kurra, in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau State Two gun runners, Idris Isma’il and Rabi’u Nasiru, were nabbed.
