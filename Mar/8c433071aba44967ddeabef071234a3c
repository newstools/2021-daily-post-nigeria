Real Madrid president, Florentino Pérez, is willing to let captain, Sergio Ramos, leave Santiago Bernabeu in the summer transfer window if the club can sign Bayern Munich’s David Alaba as his replacement, according to Marca. Perez is weighing up his options when it comes to Ramos and could be more willing to let the veteran centre-back go if he manages to sign Alaba. Alaba has since confirmed he will leave Bayern on a free transfer this summer, although his reported wage demands of £400,000 a week could be a problem. Real Madrid, Chelsea, Barcelona and Liverpool have also been credited with an interest in the Austrian international. Meanwhile, Ramos appears increasingly likely to end his 16-year spell at the club and leave on a free transfer at the end of the season. The defender, who is currently on international duty with Spain national team, entered the final 100 days of his deal at Real Madrid on Tuesday, with talks over his future at an impasse. The Spain international is out of contract with the La Liga champions at the end of this season, and negotiations over a new deal have stalled. Ramos is already free to talk to clubs outside Spain, and it is believed that his agent and brother, Rene Ramos, is eyeing a move to the English Premier League, EPL. The 34-year-old wants a longer deal, having been offered a one-year extension with a 10 per cent pay cut because of the financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.
