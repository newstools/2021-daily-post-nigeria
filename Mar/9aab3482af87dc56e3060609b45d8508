Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo has finally responded to news and statistics placing him as the world’s highest goalscorer ever. There were arguments and suggestions that Pele was still leading in the chart with some websites crediting the Brazilian legend with over 1000 goals. But in an Instagram post on Sunday, minutes after his hat-trick against Cagliari in a Serie A fixture, Ronaldo pointed out that some of Pele’s goals were unofficial. Ronaldo noted that Pele’s 9 goals for São Paulo State Team, as well as his single goal for the Brazilian Military Team, were not official goals, also insisted that present-day football is far different from what it used to be in the mid-20th century when Pele was played. “The last few weeks were filled with news and stats considering me the World’s Top Scorer in football history, overcoming Pelé’s 757 official goals,” he wrote. “Although I’m thankful for that recognition, now it’s time for me to explain why I didn’t acknowledge that record until this moment. “My everlasting and unconditional admiration for mister Edson Arantes do Nascimento[Pele] such as the respect that I have for mid-20th century football, led me to take into account his 767 scores, assuming his 9 goals for São Paulo State Team, as well as his single goal for the Brazilian Military Team, as official goals. “The World as changed since then and football as changed as well, but this doesn’t mean that we can just erase history according to our interests. “Today, as I reach the 770 official goals in my professional career, my first words go straight to @pele. No player in the World hasn’t been raised listening to stories about his games, his goals and his achievements, and I’m no exception. “And for that reason, I’m filled with joy and pride as I acknowledge the goal that puts me on top of the World’s goalscoring list, overcoming Pelé’s record, something that I could never have dreamed of while growing up as a child from Madeira.”
