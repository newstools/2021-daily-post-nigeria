Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje, a former National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has said that the armed Fulani herdsmen wreaking havoc on Nigerians across the country are not Nigerians. Speaking in an interview with journalists in Ilorin, Kwara State, the elder statesman pointed out statesman Fulani herdsmen have been living in communities around the country without problems for so long. He noted that Nigerian Fulani herdsmen have acculturated into their various communities and for this reason could not be responsible for this level of criminality. Baraje said that his earlier comment about the identity of the criminal herdsmen was contradicted, adding, “All these false claims would not change my original position that the government and our security agencies must investigate the infiltration of our country by foreign criminal elements who masquerade as Fulani herders. “The Fulanis involved in criminal activities are not Nigerians. The Fulani herdsmen in Nigeria do not carry guns. They only have matchete used to clear the bush as they progress with their cows and a stick to direct the animals. “Those who carry arms are mere criminals who exploited the porosity of our borders and came in without cattle. “This is all I told the journalists and this remains my analysis of the situation,” he insisted.
