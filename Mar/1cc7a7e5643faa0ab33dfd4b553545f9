President Muhammadu Buhari has just landed safely in London, the United Kingdom. A video posted by his New media aide, Bashir Ahmad showed Buhari stepping out of the Presidential jet. Noticeably too, there was no official UK reception for Buhari since the visit is private. This means that there was no red carpet as he stepped out of the Air Force plane into a waiting car. President Buhari is expected to spend at least 2 weeks in the United Kingdom for a routine medical checkup.   A post shared by nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen)
