The University of Lagos has debunked reports claiming it has released cut off marks for placement of candidates ahead of the 2021/2022 academic session. This was contained in a statement signed by the school’s Registrar, Mr Oladejo Azeez, on Thursday. ”The university management wishes to inform prospective students and the general public that the piece of information released by the website is false, malicious, misleading, and grossly inaccurate. ”We wish to state categorically that it did not emanate from this institution. ”Members of the general public are therefore advised to make recourse only to the official communication channels of the university,” it read in part. UNILAG had conducted its Post Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination online from February 15 to February 23 and had since released the results of candidates.
