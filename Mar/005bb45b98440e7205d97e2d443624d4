Armed bandits in the early hour of Saturday attacked the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, FAAN, quarters, at the Kaduna airport and abducted 9 persons. Those kidnapped included a family of 6 and another housewife and her two children. It was gathered that the bandits gained access to the quarters through the airport runway, at about 12.30am. The screaming of the kidnapped victims attracted the military personnel aroundÂ the area who mobilised and engaged the bandits in a gun battle.
This lasted for several hours, but the bandits went away with their victims on motorcycles. The spokesperson for the FAAN, Henrietta Yakubu who confirmed the attack, disclosed that the quarters housed different personnel from various agencies of the aviation industry. Meanwhile, the Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer could not take his calls and text messages sent to him got no response.
