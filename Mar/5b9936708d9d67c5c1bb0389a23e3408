National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Monday ordered the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to send a delegation condole with the family of former Minister of State for Finance, Nenadi Usman. The NHRC panel is investigating alleged violations of rights by the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and other units of the police.

Chairman of the panel, Justice Suleiman Galadima (rtd) gave the order after listening to a petition by the family of George Akapson and Usman. Galadima, before adjournment, commended the police for taking prompt action by charging DSP Godwin Ngochukwu Wagozie to court. Wagozie has been sentenced to 16 years imprisonment. NAN reports that the sued the Wagozie of SARS, Officer-in-Charge SARS – FCT, Commissioner of Police and the Inspector-General of Police. Mother of the deceased, Esther, told the panel that her daughter graduated from Kent University in the UK. “She would have stayed back in the UK to get a job but she chose to come back to Nigeria and serve her fatherland. “But what did she get in return? She was murdered. Anita was an asset to the family but her life was cut short because of the carelessness of a policeman.” The family wants N5billion compensation to assuage the trauma we went through.
