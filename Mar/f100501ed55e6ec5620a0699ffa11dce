The Ogun State Police Command has said it knows the hideout of the gunmen who abducted the Olori-Ilu of Imope in Ijebu North Local Government, Chief Kolawole Akintayo. The State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in an interview with DAILY POST on Wednesday. Akintayo was kidnapped by some suspected bandits along Oke Eri-Imope road, while coming from Ijebu-Ode. The community leader was released on Tuesday night after serious search by the police and other local vigilantes. Speaking with our correspondent, Oyeyemi disclosed that the state command knew where the kidnappers were hiding after they took the man away. Asked why none of them was arrested even after the release of Akintayo, Oyeyemi said the police decided not to storm the kidnappers’ den in order not to “jeopardise” the life of the abductee. “All this while, it is not that we don’t know where they (the kidnappers) were. But if we stormed the place and engaged them in ‘fire-for-fire’, we’re going to jeopardise the life of that man too. That is why we had to tread softly. “But now that we have secured his release, we have every opportunity now to go after them.”
