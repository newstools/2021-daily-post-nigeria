Activist Aisha Yesufu has called for the removal of Danladi Umar, the Code of Conduct Tribunal, CCT, Chairman. Yesufu, the convener of BringBackOurGirls, BBOG advocacy group called for the removal of the code of conduct chairman for attacking a security guard in Abuja. A video had surfaced online of Umar assaulting and intimidating a security guard at a shopping mall in Wuse 2, Abuja. Umar’s action had drawn condemnation from Nigerians who demanded his arrest and prosecution. Umar has, however, denied assaulting the security guard, stressing that a Biafran boy attacked him. Adding her voice to the backlash from Nigerians, Yesufu in a series of tweets, accused the CCT Chairman of bias, hence he should be sacked from office. She said: “Chairman of the Code of Conduct tribunal refers to citizens as Biafran Boys? This is the height of it! Justice Danladi Umar needs to be removed from office! He has shown his bias and his position requires neutrality. “We must begin to buy market when any one of us is assaulted. #WeAreAllBiafrans.”
