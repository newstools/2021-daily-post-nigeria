The recklessness of commercial motorcyclists popularly called ‘Okada’ has reached an alarming crescendo in Ilesa town and environs as the level of motorcycles’ accidents has become a major concern. Eyewitness accounts revealed to DAILY POST that the influx of Okada accident victims who were brought to the Accident and Emergency (A and E) Unit of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Wesley Guild, Ilesa was on the high side. DAILY POST gathered that about twenty victims were brought to the A and E Unit in an interval of three days out of which seven were brought in dead or died in the process of resuscitation. According to Mr. Olusola Akin, a patient’s relative at the hospital, who blamed the increase of motorcycle accidents on the recklessness and impatience of the motorcyclists and commercial transporters most of whom were fond of driving while intoxicated, these trends have caused a lot of havoc in many families leaving behind a trail of sorrow and agony. He called for the intervention of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) to restore sanity to the roads by reintroducing alcohol and drug monitoring devices to both commercial drivers and motorcyclists. He also advocated the application of punitive measures against unlicensed drivers, erring motorists and motorcyclists. He revealed that some days back, a staff of the Federal Government School of Science and Technology, Cappa, Ilesa was ran-over and killed when the commercial motorcycle she was riding on collided with a minibus. Members of the commercial motorcycle union interviewed revealed that most of the erring motorcyclists were not their registered members as they usually held sensitisation meetings with them on safety and hazards of their profession. They revealed that it was forbidden for their members to operate while drunk and that members of the public had been notified to report any erring member to the appropriate quarters for the necessary action to be taken.
