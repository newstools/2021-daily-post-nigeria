President of Russia, Vladimir Putin has reacted to a statement by US President Joe Biden, calling him a killer. Putin, when asked about Biden’s comments during a video call on Thursday aired on Russian State TV, said he wished Biden good health, adding that for the US President to call him a killer, it takes one to know one. The Russian leader said; “In the history of every state, every people, there are lots of hard, dramatic and bloody event but when we evaluate other persons or even governments, we always look as if into the mirror. We always see ourselves in it. “I remember when I was young and I got into fights with my friends, we always say ‘whoever calls names is called that himself. “It takes one to know one. “And that’s not just a children’s joke. The meaning is quite deep psychologically. We always see our own qualities in another person and think that he/she is like ourselves. And coming from that, evaluate his/her actions and evaluate him/her overall. “As Biden said, we know each other personally. What would I reply to him? I would say: I wish you health. I wish you health. I say that without any irony or joke.” However, Konstantin Kosachev, Deputy Chairman of the Russian parliament’s upper house, says that Moscow would likely take further steps “if the American side does not offer an explanation or apology”. Kosachev noted that Biden’s comments “were not acceptable under any circumstances” and sent any hopes of an improvement of relations between both countries under the new administration “down the drain”.
