A 2023 presidential aspirant, Yul Edochie has slammed those saying he has no political experience and as such can not run for Nigeria’s Presidency. The veteran Nollywood actor said political experience should not be a determinant of who becomes Nigerian President, adding that those with the experience had failed despite their experiences. The Anambra born actor made the assertion on Sunday in a tweet on his verified Twitter handle. “They say I have no political experience, the ones with political experience see where they have kept us. From 1960 till now. “We don’t need political experience anymore. “We need one of us. A compassionate, visionary youth with integrity who hasn’t been corrupted by the system”, Yul tweeted. Recall that his father, Nollywood icon, Pete Edochieh, on February 12, publicly endorsed his son, Yul to run for the 2023 Nigerian presidential election.
