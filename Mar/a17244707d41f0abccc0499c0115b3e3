Real Madrid could appoint club legend, Raul Gonzalez, if they are unable to convince Zinedine Zidane to sign a new contract, according to Diario AS. Zidane has just over one year left on his current deal. The Frenchman has regularly cast doubt on his future since he returned for a second spell as Los Blancos boss in 2019. While Los Blancos chiefs still hope Zidane will commit his future to the club, they have lined up two targets in case he departs. Real’s president, Florentino Perez, is keen on Raul and outgoing Germany boss Joachim Low. Low will leave his role after this summer’s European Championship, while Raul is considered the more likely candidate. Raul scored 323 goals in 741 appearances for the club during his playing days.
