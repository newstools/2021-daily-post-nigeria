Every Adult in Nigeria deserves to own a car of his/her choice. In a developed country like the United State where we buy cars from, you don’t require to have all the money before you own a car. All you need is to approach your bank and tell them the kind of car you need. After checking your credit report and they are satisfied then you qualify to pick any car of your choice from any car dealer. Your insurance company will thereafter work it out with your bank while you get placed on mortgage for five years. Even if the car gets involved in an accident during this process, they will still collect it from you and give you another brand new car. Now that the Federal Government has ordered that the border should be reopened it will be easier and cheaper to clear through COTONOU. You can now buy any car with any higher year, you can be rest assured that the clearing will be easier and cheaper with genuine documents. Custom will not disturb you except you clear through smuggling. The car will be tagged and cleared by Nigeria Custom at the border. Cars are not that expensive at USA auctions but the car dealers here make it too scary. Let walk you through the process. Below will guide you on the best option to go for when searching for a car through Awoof Car Auction Company. Insurance Cars Auto Auction Cars bought in the United States are typically protected by an insurance policy entered into between the buyer and the insurance company. Ordinarily, if any issue occurs with the car, the insurance company would handle it. However, where the issue involves selling the car, the insurance companies would usually dispose of the car via the US Public Auto Auction Services. There are basically three grades of cars that are sold by these insurance companies in the US Auto Auction and they shall be discussed below. Grade A – Clean Title or Repossessed Cars Owning a car moves from being a want to a necessity when an individual attains the age of majority as stipulated by the relevant laws governing a particular country. In first world countries such as the United States, once a person is up to 18 years old, he or she is eligible to own a car and all they have to do is walk into a car dealer’s shop and pick a car of your choice. If the person does not have the full amount to pay for the car at the moment, it is normal practice to seek a mortgage payment for the car. In this case, the car dealer would have to demand for your insurance license, ID cards including driving license and other necessary documentation from the insurance company before the car would be released. The mortgage agreement would usually be for a stipulated period of time. In the event wherein the person defaults in the payment of the car, the insurance company would confiscate the car and take it to the US Auto Auction where it would be sold and the money recovered would be expended in the repayment of the mortgage. In this type of situation represented above, such cars are referred to as ‘Clean Title or Repossessed Car’. This means that the title or ownership of the car has never been transferred and we highly recommend this type of car in auction as it is generally referred to as “Grade A” auction vehicle. Grade B – Salvaged Title or Accident Cars The next type of car that is put up in public auctions by an insurance company is known as the ‘Salvage Titled Car’. Now, if you are planning on saving hundreds or even thousands of dollars on buying a car of your choice than rather spending it on cars in the traditional car dealer shops, then your best option would be salvage cars. This however is not a problem and would likely be a great deal as long as you are ready to put in extra effort on the repair of the car after purchase. When the title of a car is branded as ‘salvage’, it simply means that the car has been damaged or involved in an accident to the point that the insurance company deems it fit and necessary in line with the extant US legislation to sell them off to other countries via the US Auto Auction. It is worthy and pertinent to note that these cars are not currently in the best shape to be driven due to the damages and this would require certain repairs to restore them to a working state. We usually recommend purchasing salvaged cars that do not have a front damage and this is not strange to the fact that such damage will most likely affect the engine of the car and it must have ignited the car’s air bag to pull out. Rather, it is best to go for salvaged cars that might be damaged at the back or side. Most of the cars operating on the Nigerian roads do not have airbags and this is very dangerous. Most cunning and fraudulent car dealers after purchasing these cars off auction will sell these cars to unsuspecting buyers without disclosing these vital damages. Here at Awoof, we believe in honesty and integrity as we will guide you through the auction car selection process. These types of cars in auction are usually referred to as “Grade B” auction vehicles. Grade C – Flood Cars Natural disasters which are otherwise referred to as Acts of God are circumstances that are far beyond human control. These natural disasters include hurricanes, tornados, storms, earthquakes, wildfires, e.t.c. However, just like every other type of natural disaster listed above, floods can create a very huge damage to lives, and properties. Out of the numerous properties usually damaged by flood disasters, automobiles stand in the front row. The United States experiences quite a series of flood disasters on a yearly basis and during these periods of flood crisis, cars are partially or completely submerged in water for quite some time until the water dries up. After this, if the vehicle is so damaged that it is no longer operable, the owner’s insurance company settles the claim by buying the vehicle and selling it at the US Auto Auction. Usually, we do not recommend this grade of auction car because of the enormous damage that has been caused to the engine unless the buyer insists on purchasing it and thereafter changing the engine of the car. Just as we have earlier stated, most unscrupulous and mischievous car dealers will buy these flood vehicles off auction, import them into Nigeria, fix them haphazardly and thereafter sell these cars to unsuspecting buyers. In little or no time, these cars will start developing problems that will most likely result in the total breakdown of the engine. Here in our company, we believe in honesty and integrity as we will guide you through the auction car selection process. These types of cars in auction are usually referred to as “Grade C” auction vehicles. It is not always advisable to buy this kind of grade because there is no way you will fix it that will be totally okay. Most times, it is not strange to find a car owner driving a recently bought car without using the air conditioner and if you ask them they will tell you the air-conditioning system is not working well or not working at all. How can someone buy a car that is recent and the air-conditioning will not work? It is because most of those cars are flood vehicles which were refurbished by the Nigerian car dealers. They do this because these types of cars are very cheap to buy in Auction and since they want to make a lot of money they tend to buy Flood vehicles all in the name of see and buy. www.awoofcarsauction.com Below are the reasons why you should buy a car through our platform. .We allow you to make payment directly to the auction yourself.
