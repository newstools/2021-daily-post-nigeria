Manchester United defender, Luke Shaw and manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, will not face any punishment from the English FA following their comments on referee Stuart Attwell after the club’s 0-0 draw against Chelsea last Sunday. Man United’s team were angry not to have been awarded a penalty in the first half of the encounter against Chelsea when Callum Hudson-Odoi and Mason Greenwood challenged for the ball, which bounced up and appeared to hit both players’ arms inside the 18-yard box. VAR called the attention of referee Stuart Attwell, but he decided not to award a spot-kick to Man United after consulting the on-pitch screen. After the game, Shaw, in his post-match interview with Sky Sports, claimed referee Attwell had told Man United captain, Harry Maguire, that while he felt it was a penalty, awarding it would “cause a lot of talks.” On his part, Solskjaer then backed up Shaw’s claims saying he had heard the same thing from his players, as well as launching an attack on Chelsea for trying to influence referees. However, The Times reports that, after reviewing footage from the interviews and reports filed from the match officials, the FA have now decided against charging Shaw and Solskjaer with misconduct. The English football body felt that the comments didn’t violate disciplinary rule E3(1), which says a player should be charged if their comments imply an official is biased or attacks their integrity, while it would have been difficult to prove the charge to an independent panel. Man United’s next game is against Crystal Palace on Wednesday night at Selhurst Park Stadium.
