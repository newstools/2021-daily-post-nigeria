The Chief of Army Staff, COAS, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, says the renewed onslaught on Boko Haram insurgents in the North East is to be expanded to other conflict areas in the country. Attahiru stated this on Monday, in Maiduguri, while showing newsmen a cache of arms recovered from insurgents in the latest operations by troops. The COAS, who is in Maiduguri for a one-week operational visit, said the onslaught would continue with more intensity. “We will continue with this, as you can see, our soldiers are highly motivated and willing to ensure the total removal of Boko Haram in the North East. “This will not just stop here as all other parts of Nigeria will get the same treatment,” Attahiru said. The COAS said all necessary support would be given to the troops to sustain the tempo and deliver on their mandate, saying he only visited to talk to them and boost their morale.
