The Nigerian Medical Association, NMA, has urged Nigerians to get vaccination for COVID-19, stating that the AstraZeneca vaccine procured by Nigeria is safe. Prof. Baba Issa, Kwara NMA Chairman, gave the advice while speaking with newsmen in Ilorin on Saturday, NAN reports. Issa said when many people get vaccinated, Nigerians will develop herd-immunity. ”It depends on the vaccine that they are taking, but the one we have in Nigeria made by AstraZeneca company is known to be safe and efficacious. “That is why Nigeria has keyed into it and the Kwara Government has taken delivery of some doses of this vaccine. ”So I’ll advise people to take it, it is safe and it is very effective. “Herd immunity is resistance to the spread of an infectious disease within a population that is based on pre-existing immunity of a high proportion of individuals as a result of previous infection or vaccination,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that 10 European countries had suspended the vaccine’s use, following claims of blood clot associated with its usage.
