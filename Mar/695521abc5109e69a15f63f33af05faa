Stoke City manager, Michael O’Neill, has named Nigerian midfielder, John Mikel Obi, among three players that particularly ‘need rest’ in his squad amid the international break. The other two players that need rest in Stoke City’s squad are James Chester and Steven Fletcher. O’Neill said this on Monday following his side’s 1-0 home victory over Derby County in the Championship over the weekend. Stoke City now have a 12-day lay-off before they return to action with a Good Friday trip to Bristol City and O’Neill says he will make the most of the opportunity to give his players time away from the training ground. “We need the rest, to be honest, although we have got a number of lads away with their countries,” O’Neill was quoted by Stoke City’s official website as saying. “The likes of John (Obi Mikel), Chessie (James Chester) and Fletch (Steven Fletcher) in particular need the rest. “We will have a nice little recovery week this week, and we have got a bounce game arranged, ironically, against Derby on Thursday for some of the younger players and some of those who haven’t played too much and then we will be ready to go against Bristol City. “I am hoping that a few of the lads who have been out just recently – the likes of Sam Clucas, James McClean, Jordan Cousins and Tashan Oakley-Boothe – will be available again after the break.” Stoke City are currently in the 11th position on the Championship table with 52 points from 38 matches.
