The Nigeria Union of Journalists, Osun State Council has condemned in strong terms an open assault meted out to one of its members, Niyi Akinromade by Nigeria Ambassador to Mexico, Adejare Bello. DAILY POST had earlier reported that newly-appointed Nigerian ambassador to Mexico, Bello, on Friday, assaulted a journalist in Osogbo, the capital of Osun State. Bello, a two-term former Speaker of the Osun State Assembly, currently representing Nigeria as an Ambassador, publicly attacked Adeniyi Akinromade, a reporter of the Osun State Broadcasting Corporation while he was rendering social service during a traffic gridlock. DAILY POST reports that there was gridlock on Friday morning at Oke-Fia in Osogbo and the concerned journalist, decided to help direct vehicles away from the hold-up, to ensure the freef-loww of traffic on the jammed routes. In a statement by the Chairman of the council, Comrade Wasiu Ajadosu and the Secretary,Comrade Bukola Elufadejin stated, it is least expected a person of Adejare status to engage in such public assault on a journalist who was rendering social service at Oke-Fia in Osogbo. The statement frowned at the undignified attitude of Bello to descend so low to the point of slapping a citizen of Nigeria who he is assigned to protect their interest in Mexico. It noted that the union would no longer tolerate attempt by highly-placed people to subject journalists to inhuman treatment. The union, therefore, demandes an apology from the former speaker of Osun State House of Assembly, Bello and warned against reoccurrence of such act.
