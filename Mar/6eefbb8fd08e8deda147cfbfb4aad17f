Chelsea legend, Petr Cech, has predicted the Blues to qualify for the Champions League semi-finals ahead of FC Porto when both sides clash in the quarter-final first and second legs in April. Cech, who admitted that the tie against Porto would be tough, believes Chelsea’s confidence and strength will help them secure a semi-finals spot. The former goalkeeper said this while reacting to Chelsea’s Champions League last-8 draw against Porto on Friday. Chelsea eliminated Atletico Madrid from the Champions League last-16, while Porto knocked out Juventus. “When you reach the quarter-final of the Champions League, you know you will face a difficult opponent,” Cech told Chelsea’s website. “As it stands now, we play Porto as normal away and home and you can prepare for that. “It is an opponent we need to respect. They have a history in the Champions League and European Cup. It is a team we will be prepared for and ready to play against.” He added, “We have played Porto a few times in the Champions League. “All the games were always tight and very difficult. We expect the same. They were good in the group with Manchester City, and they managed to go and beat Juventus, another giant of European football, so we’ve to respect that, but we’ve our confidence, and we know the strength of our team. Hopefully, we can go through.” Cech met Porto on three occasions during his playing days. He won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2012.
