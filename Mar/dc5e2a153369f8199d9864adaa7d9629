Dr. Jose Gonzalez, who works for Atletico Madrid, has claimed Real Madrid’s Eden Hazard “may never play football again” if he undergoes a third ankle operation. Gonzalez has suggested Hazard’s career could be in doubt. Hazard is reportedly looking to have another ankle operation, as he seeks to end his injury nightmare at Real. But Dr. Gonzalez told Ondacero: “A third operation on Eden Hazard’s ankle is very risky, there could be the possibility that the player would not play football again.” Hazard has endured a torrid time in Spain, since moving from Chelsea in 2019. The 30-year-old has been dogged by persistent problems with his left ankle, which has restricted him to just 14 appearances this season.
