Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, on Monday, said about 2.5 million persons have registered in the ongoing All Progressives Congress (APC) membership registration/revalidation exercise in the state. Ganduje’s claim was contained in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Abba Anwar. According to the statement, Ganduje made the disclosure while speaking at the sixth APC stakeholders meeting in Kano, the state capital. The governor said the first set of 100 registers made available to each polling unit were exhausted at the commencement of the exercise, adding that the second set of 200 per polling units has also been exhausted. “The registration is heading towards three or four million members in the state. Just look at the trend since we started,” he said. The governor while urging those in charge of the registration to ensure fairness, said, “there should be no marginalisation. Register all those who wish to be registered as bonafide members of our great party and that is part of the wisdom why we have been succeeding as a party”. Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Alhaji Murtala Garo also said that all the bundles provided by the APC national headquarters for the exercise in the state have been exhausted. He noted that the state needs additional membership cards for each polling unit from the party’s headquarters. “The additional 200 membership cards per polling unit have already been collected by members in almost 7,000 units. So there is need for more from the national headquarters,” he said.
