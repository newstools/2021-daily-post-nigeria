The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has said it is yet to decide on the zone to produce its candidate for the 2023 presidential election. PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan who made this known while appearing on Arise news said the party is yet to adopt any of the recommendations made by the Bala Mohammed-led committee, including that of zoning its presidential ticket. He said the proposal which advised that Nigerians from every part of the country be given an opportunity for the purpose of choosing the best candidate was still in review. “Due to enquiries from our members and the general public, it has become important to clarify that PDP is yet to adopt any of the recommendations proposed by the Bala Mohammed‘s Committee on the Review of the 2019 Elections. “As such, it will be incongruous for anyone to assert that any decision had been taken by PDP on the zoning of the presidential ticket ahead of the 2023 general elections. “Members and supporters are enjoined to note that the party is yet to take any decision on the proposals presented by the committee,” he said. Ologbondiyan revealed that the party will not be rooting for a tribal or regional leader but a nationalist who would unify the country. Recall that the Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari earlier advocated for a Southern presidency in 2023. He said it would be unfair for the Southern part of the country not to produce Nigeria’s next president in 2023.
