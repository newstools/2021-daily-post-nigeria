Bayern Munich defender, Lucas Hernández, has said that he would say three words to keep Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappá quiet when both teams clash in the Champions League quarter-final in April. Hernandez, a fellow compatriot with Mbappe, also joked he is ready to go to war with the forward when Bayern Munich tackle PSG in the Champions League last-8. Bayern had defeated PSG 1-0 in the Champions League final last season. Hernandez was an unused substitute for the Bundesliga champions that day, while Mbappe played the full 90 minutes for PSG. “If I have to face him, I will say two or three words to keep him quiet,” Hernandez told L’Equipe. “I will tell him above all he should stick to PSG’s left side. If he comes to the right, then it will be a war! I’m kidding, but it’s true he has a talent, and we must be vigilant with him. “The Champions League is what we are aiming to retain on May 29. Everyone is determined to do exactly that.”
