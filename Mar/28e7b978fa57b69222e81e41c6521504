Manchester star, Amad Diallo, on Thursday night, made history following his side’s Europa League last-16 first-leg 1-1 draw with AC Milan. Two second-half goals from Diallo and Simon Kjaer ensured both Man United and AC Milan drew at Old Trafford. According to OptaJose, Diallo’s goal against Milan means the Ivorian youngster is now the youngest non-British player to ever score in a major European competition for Man United at the age of 18 years and 243 days. Man United will travel to Italy next week Thursday for the second-leg tie at San Siro. Diallo will now hope to feature for Man United when they face West Ham United in the Premier League on Sunday. The winger completed his move to Man United last January after the Red Devils agreed a £37 million deal with Atalanta on transfer deadline day in October 2020. He signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side.
