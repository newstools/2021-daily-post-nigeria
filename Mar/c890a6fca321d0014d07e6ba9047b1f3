Prince William on Thursday, defended the British royal family, after his younger brother Harry and wife Meghan Markle, accused them of racism in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. “We’re very much not a racist family,” William said during a visit to a London school today, the Daily Mail reports. Meghan admitted she contemplated committing suicide after joining the royal family. She also raised allegations of racism in the monarchy during the explosive television interview on Sunday. The former actress claimed there were concerns about the skin colour of her unborn son. “In those months when I was pregnant… we have in tandem the conversation of ‘he won’t be given security, he’s not going to be given a title’ and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he’s born,” Meghan said.
