Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemi, popularly known as Sunday Igboho has alleged plot by terrorists to attack his mother. Igboho disclosed that two terrorists’ attempt to allegedly harm his mother in her residence in Oyo State was foiled. He claimed that while one of the terrorists was arrested, the other escaped. This was disclosed by Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, via his Twitter handle. “I just spoke to Sunday Igboho and he told me that two terrorists were apprehended in his mother’s home in Igboho, Oyo state this evening. “Their mission was to harm Mama. One of them escaped whilst the other is now in police custody. This is a dangerous course to tread. Think twice!,” he tweeted.
