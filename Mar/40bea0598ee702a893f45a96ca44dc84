PSG star, Leandro Paredes, has said that he has been warned by officials of the French champions not to talk about Lionel Messi again amid the ongoing speculation surrounding the Argentina superstar’s future. The Argentina International is being heavily linked with Manchester City and PSG with the 33-year-old set to become a free agent at the end of June. Neymar, Angel Di Maria and now Paredes have all publicly welcomed the prospect of Messi’s arrival at PSG. Paredes said that PSG officials gave him a slap on the wrists for his earlier comments about Messi’s arrival, telling Le Journal Du Dimanche : “They have asked me not to talk about it anymore. “People didn’t like my position on what I was saying. Some people saw it as disrespectful. This was not the case for me. “It’s up to Messi to decide calmly at the end of the season what he wants to do with his future.”
