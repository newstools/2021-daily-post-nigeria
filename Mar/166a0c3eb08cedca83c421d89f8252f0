Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has identified Nigerian international, Kelechi Iheanacho as one of the threats his side will face when Leicester City hosts the Red Devils in the quarterfinals of the Emirates FA Cup at the King Power Stadium on Sunday. Iheanacho has scored in three consecutive games going into the match including a hat-trick against Sheffield United last weekend. Apart from Iheanacho, the manager also named Jamie Vaddy, Ayoze Perez and Youri Tielemans among the players that must be stopped. “Of course, we drew in the league against them and we know we have to defend well against them,” Solskjaer said at the pre-match press conference. “They’ve got [Jamie] Vardy and [Kelechi] Iheanacho, with the form they’re showing, and they’ve got quality in other players, the passes of [Youri] Tielemans, the runs of [Ayoze] Perez. So we know we’ve got a game on our hands.” Iheanacho will travel to Lagos after the game to join with his national teammates for the African Cup of Nations qualifying game against Benin Republic and Lesotho.
