Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has hailed the appointment of Darren Fletcher as the club’s new technical director, saying: “His DNA is what we want”. The Red Devils confirmed a shake-up of their top hierarchy on Wednesday. Head of football development, John Murtough, has been promoted to football director and first-team coach Fletcher will work alongside him. Transfer chief, Matt Judge, has formally been named as director of football negotiations. Speaking about Fletcher ahead of United’s Europa League Last-16 tie against AC Milan on Thursday, Solskjaer – who played alongside the Scot for four years at Old Trafford – said: “A few months back when we were making the final decision, there were a few other things for Darren. We moved [former coach] Mark Dempsey to the academy and there was a coaching spot. “If there was one thing I was sure of, it was “we cannot lose Darren”. He has a history with the club, he’s been brought up here from a young boy to a Champions League winner and serial winner. His DNA is what we want. “He went away to other clubs and he’s got fresh ideas too. He’s got a bright eye for football and following the development of youngsters. “He can combine these two, doing a little less coaching and now he can have an influence on the other side of it – recruitment, speaking to players and selling United as the club he knows it is.”
