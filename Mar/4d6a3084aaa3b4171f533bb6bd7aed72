Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has described Sergio Aguero as “irreplaceable” ahead of the striker’s exit this summer. On Monday, City confirmed that Aguero would be leaving the Etihad at the end of the season. It brings an end to a 10-year stint, which saw the Argentine become the club’s all-time top scorer. “We have still two months ahead and today I saw the training session, how brilliant he was and his commitment,” Guardiola told Sky Sports. “Sergio is irreplaceable. I could say in terms of numbers he can be replaceable, it’s not easy when you see more than 360 games played and more than 250 goals, the number of titles. “So it’s the legend, the best striker this club has ever had for this century through the years, but is irreplaceable in the souls, in the hearts, in the minds of our fans, of our people, of the players that played alongside him and all the managers who worked with him. “He’s a fantastic person, a human being, and I’m pretty sure if his mind is still aggressive like he is, he can extend his career longer and longer than maybe two or three or four or five years.”
