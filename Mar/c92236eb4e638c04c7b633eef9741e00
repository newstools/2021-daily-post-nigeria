A Nigerian human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore has called on Nigerians residing in the United Kingdom, UK, to repatriate President Muhammadu Buhari back to Nigeria. DAILY POST recalls that the president, on Tuesday afternoon, departed Nigeria for the UK to undergo a medical check-up. According to the presidency, Buhari is expected to return to the country during the second week of April. But on his Twitter page, Sowore who has been initiating different protests against the current government over alleged bad governance, said the president should be chased back to patronize the medical facilities in the country. “Nigerians in the UK please help send @mbuhari back home for his annual medical check-up at the “World Class” hospital he built in Nigeria! If you’re one of the 8,000 medical doctor of Nigerian descent in the UK, you should join this fight”, he tweeted. President Buhari’s medical trip came when the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) is threatening to embark on an indefinite strike over the Federal Government’s inability to meet their demands.
