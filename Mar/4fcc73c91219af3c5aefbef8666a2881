He said “When the effort of the policemen failed, an unidentified male called me on the phone and pleaded with me to take some financial gratification to set the tankers free but I turned down the offer, promising to get to the bottom of the matter” He assured that he would not compromise the mandate by President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure that issues of pipeline vandalism, crude oil theft, and other criminal activities associated with the oil and gas sector are curbed in the Niger Delta. In his words “As I speak with you some uniform Police officers at the Sagbama junction were trying to stop the arrest of the tankers conveying the adulterated petrol products” “According to them a prominent businessman with wide experience in the oil and gas sector is the owner of the tankers and that they are not willing to let us impound the tankers.”
