Marta Garcia, Manchester United’s midfielder, Juan Mata’s mother is dead. She died following a severe illness, according to Spanish daily newspaper La Nueva Espana. According the newspaper, Marta had been suffering from the illness ‘for some time’. Mata had told Manchester United official website that he shared a very close relationship with his mother and talks to her shortly before matches. “My mother has always been more worried about my physical wellbeing during a match than the result,’ Mata said in 2019. “That’s why, even now, I always call her when I’m on the coach on the way to the stadium. Always. “It’s a ritual that we both enjoy, and which is also an extra source of motivation for me.”
