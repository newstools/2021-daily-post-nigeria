Kelechi Iheanacho has praised Jamie Vardy after the Super Eagles striker netted his first Premier League hat-trick against Sheffield United on Sunday. The Nigerian international hailed Vardy for providing him two assists during the game that ended 5-0. Vardy set up Iheanacho’s first and second goals with the third one being a superb effort from outside the area. Kelechi wants Vardy (34) to keep playing for the next six years. “I am really happy I play alongside Jamie. I said before when I did an interview that he always creates spaces for me. “He makes it easy for me to make runs behind,” Iheanacho said to Sky Sports just after the game. “Playing with him is a joy, hopefully, he will keep going until 40 years because I’m really happy and delighted playing with him. “He’s a team player, I think he helps everyone in the team, even if he’s not scoring he’s still helping the team to win. “He gave me two assists today, as you can see he’s really good when he’s not scoring but I think the goals will come for him very soon.” The Super Eagles forward also dedicated his goals to all women around the world as they celebrate International Women’s Day. The former Manchester City striker has now scored 7 goals in the Premier League and 10 in all competitions this season.
