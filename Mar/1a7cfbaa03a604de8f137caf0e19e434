Arsenal hero, Paul Merson has advised the club on signing Real Madrid loanee, Martin Odegaard, on a permanent transfer. Merson said he would be ‘disappointed’ if Arsenal had not already made an offer to sign Odegaard permanently from Real Madrid. Odegaard has been impressive for Mikel Arteta’s side since joining the Gunners last January on a loan deal until the end of the season. “Martin Odegaard looks like a really good player and I hope Arsenal have a chance of signing him permanently,” Merson told Starsport. “Because if they don’t have a chance of making his loan permanent next season, why is he playing? If they know he doesn’t want to stay, he shouldn’t be playing because he’s taking opportunities away from people like Emile Smith Rowe. “So I hope Arsenal have done their homework and know what the situation is – I’d be disappointed if they haven’t already made a bid, to be honest! It took him a while to adjust, but you have to give him the ball. “He gets into lots of good positions, and to start with his team-mates weren’t seeing him. They weren’t giving him the ball. But now he’s getting it more often, and he’s making things happen,” he added.
