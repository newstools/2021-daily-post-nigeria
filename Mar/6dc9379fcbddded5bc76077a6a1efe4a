Europe’s highest paid top footballers have been revealed with Barcelona’s Messi and Juventus’ Cristiano Ronaldo taking the lead. Messi is however, earning astonishingly more than twice the wages of his rival. Recall that Messi’s Barcelona contract details were leaked earlier in the year and it was the biggest deal in sporting history. And now French outlet, L’Equipe reports that the Argentina International’s salary breaks down to an incredible weekly wage of £2.1 million which is about £108.2 million yearly income. Ronaldo is second on the list with £900,000 weekly from Juventus, according to L’Equipe and earns £46.7 million per year. This is less than half of Messi’s salary. Brazilian international and Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, occupies the third position with the earnings of £606,000 per week (£31.5 million per year) from the French champions. Joint fourth on the list, Luis Suarez, collects £575,000 per week from Atletico Madrid and Barca’s Antoine Griezmann earns something similar: just under £30 million per year, according to the report. Another PSG star, Kylian Mbappe will apparently get a salary increase to €30 million per season if he signs a new contract with the club.
