Jose Mourinho will be sacked as Tottenham Hotspur manager, if he does not finish in the Premier League top four, SportsMail reports. Mourinho is under big pressure to deliver top-level European football after Spurs were dumped out of the Europa League by Dinamo Zagreb. Dinamo lost the first leg 2-0 in London but produced a stunning performance yesterday to beat Tottenham 3-0 to qualify for the quarter-finals. A season out of Europe will place a significant strain on Tottenham’s finances that have already endured major blows by their failure to qualify for this term’s Champions League and the COVID-19 pandemic. There are also reports that Mourinho is fighting to control a divided dressing room. The process of identifying his potential replacements has already begun, with RB Leipzig boss Julian Naglesmann viewed by many behind the scenes as the perfect candidate to take over. Naglesmann could come in for as less as £6million a year, a fraction of Mourinho’s current 13million salary. Leicester boss, Brendan Rodgers, is also admired but his appointment would be riddled with difficulties.
