The Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola has ordered the immediate repair of the roofs of Osogbo Grammar School which was damaged by the heavy downpour experienced in the town on Thursday. Also damaged as a result of the heavy downpour were other facilities within the premises of the school located along the Osogbo-Iwo road, Oke-Fia, Osogbo. The order was given by the governor during an inspection tour of the school occasioned by the aftermath of Thursdayâ€™s rain. Most affected were two-storeyed classroom blocks and some staff offices. In the entourage of the governor was the Engr. Remi Omowaiye, the Commissioner for Works and Transport and other members of the state executive council. DAILY POST had earlier reported that rainfall accompanied by strong winds had wreaked havoc in some parts of Osogbo last week. As a result of the onset of the rainy season which is usually accompanied by high winds, businesses, homes and electricity supply to some areas were shut off. Electricity supply had since returned to normal in some areas within the state capital but some affected households and businesses are yet to recover from the damage caused by the heavy downpour.
