Manchester City has announced that their top striker, Sergio Aguero, will leave the club at the end of the season when his contract expires. Aguero’s deal with the Premier League leaders will end at the end of the current season and City said they are not renewing. Aguero, now 32, joined the club in a £35 million deal from Atletico Madrid in July 2011 and has gone on to win four Premier League titles . “Sergio’s contribution to Manchester City over the last 10 years cannot be overstated,’ said City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak. “His legend will be indelibly etched into the memories of everyone who loves the Club and maybe even in those who simply love football. “This is not yet the moment for farewell words and speeches. There is still much to achieve in the remainder of the time we have with Sergio, and we look forward to his contributions to the challenges which lay ahead. “In the meantime, it gives me great pleasure to announce that we will be commissioning an artist to create a statue of Sergio to live at the Etihad Stadium alongside the ones under construction for Vincent and David. And we look forward to the opportunity to bid Sergio a fitting farewell at the end of the season. The Argentina International started his football career at Independiente and became the youngest player to play in the Argentine Primera División. He played his first game for Independiente at the age of 15 and 35 days, breaking the record previously established by Argentina legend Diego Maradona in 1976. He later joined Atlético Madrid for a transfer fee of €23 million from where he moved to Manchester City in July 2011 for a fee in the region of £35 million. The Argentina International striker became Manchester City’s all-time highest goal-scorer in November 2017 when he netted his 178th goals for the Manchester based club against Italian side Napoli in the Champions League.
