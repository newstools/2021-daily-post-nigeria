Nollywood actor, Swanky JKA has said the movie industry in Nigeria is stereotyped with no structure. The ‘Living in Bondage’ star actor said this during an interview with Ebuka Obi-Uchendu on Rubbin minds. According to him, Nollywood is all about money and has ‘stereotyping’ as its biggest problem. Swanky said: “The Biggest problem with Nollywood is stereotyping, if I was an actor in Lagos when I auditioned for Living in bondage’ I may not have been chosen for the role because they were looking for someone that was not popular. “There is no plan or structure in Nollywood, it’s all about the money. It is just like when everyone is doing Ghetto or comedy movies, everyone would do comedy and it’s a big problem “Most veteran actors are being stereotyped to one role and that’s not good.” Recall Swanky JKA won the 2020 AMVCA trailblazer award for his outstanding achievement and role in ‘Living in bondage’
