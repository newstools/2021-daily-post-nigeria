The Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in Abia State, Rt. Hon. Asiforo Okere has expressed confidence that the party’s candidate, Chief Chimaobi Ebisike would win the forthcoming Aba North and South Federal Constituency by-election. Recall that following the death of Hon. Ossy Prestige who was representing the constituency at the House of Representatives, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, fixed March 27 for the by-election. The deceased who was elected under the umbrella of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), died February 6 in Germany. In a statement forwarded to DAILY POST on Tuesday, the state’s PDP leader, Okere, pointed out that the opposition parties in the election were only visible in noise making. His words, “They (the opposition parties) are a threat in noise-making but in reality, they are nowhere and you know that the opposition thrives in noise making and you cannot take that away from them. They are making reasonable Abians think that a serious fight or war is going on but in the field, they are nowhere”. Okere said the PDP was currently mobilizing eligible voters to ensure victory at the poll, adding that the party is far ahead of its major opponents(APGA and the All Progressives Congress, APC) “We are mobilizing our party, we are mobilizing the masses. We are mobilizing Aba People. Our attention is on campaign, mass mobilization, educating our people on the rights and the right thing to do”, he said.
