Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has accepted full responsibility for Gabriel Martinelli’s recent absence. The 19-year-old burst onto the scene last season, where he netted 10 goals in all competitions for the Gunners. But he picked up a serious knee injury in June, which ruled him out of action until December. Since returning to action he is yet to complete 90 minutes and has largely had to settle for cameo appearances off the bench. Ahead of Arsenal’s Europa League last-16 second leg against Olympiacos, Arteta was asked if Martinelli was to blame for his lack of minutes. But he replied: “No if anything it’s my fault. He’s done everything perfect. “His attitude cannot be any better. He needs to be a little bit patient and he will get his chance.”
