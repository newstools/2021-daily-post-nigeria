A trader, and mother of three children, Mrs Mmesoma Okafor has reportedly beaten her 11 years old house help, Kosisochukwu Akuma to death. The incident it was learnt happened two weeks ago, at Nkpor, Idemili North LGA, near Onitsha, where the woman, her husband, children and house help resided. Mrs Okafor, a 25 years old trader who deals in secondhand underwear, was paraded by the state police command. She told journalists that the girl was brought to her as a house help by a man in their area, who usually ‘supplies’ girls to families in the neighbourhood. She said, “Kosi was brought to me as a house help. I did not torture her, she already had wound all over her body when she was brought to my house.” It was learnt that Mrs Okafor had subjected the young Kosisochukwu to intense torture until she collapsed. She was, however, said to have been rushed to a hospital for medical attention by neighbours, but was pronounced dead by a doctor, upon arrival. Okafor said she hails from Oraeri community in Aguata LGA of Anambra State and a mother of three children. She added that since after the ordeal, her husband has disappeared, and can not be traced. The spokesperson of the Anambra State Police Command, CSP Haruna Mohammed said there was a need to parade the suspects, as news on social media indicated that the woman has been let off the hook by the police, after allegedly paying a bribe. He said that Mmesoma would on Monday be arraigned before the court.
