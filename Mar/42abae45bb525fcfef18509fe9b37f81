The National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) has clarified reports that a corps member, Nazim Usman Gomna, allegedly conspired to hack into the website of the Al-Hikmah varsity and diverted students’ school fees to the tune of N9.1m. NYSC, in a tweet on Friday, said the alleged culprit was indeed a corps member in Jigawa State who had been discharged from Service, and therefore no longer one. “RE: NAZIM USMAN GOMNA,” NYSC tweeted. “The attention of Management of the National Youth Service Corps has been drawn to an online news that a corps member in Jigawa State, with the above name was arraigned in Court for alleged theft of N9.1M, property of Al-Hikmah University Ilorin Kwara State. “To put issues in proper perspective, the alleged culprit was indeed a Corps Member in Jigawa State who had been discharged from Service, and therefore no longer one. “The general public should kindly take note of this revelation for proper guidance. Management.” DAILY POST recalls that Gomna and a 400 level student of Al-Hikmah varsity in Ilorin, Idris Shuaibu Suleiman, was arraigned before a Kwara State High Court over offences bordering on N9.1m theft. They were arraigned on a three-count charge of conspiracy and theft before Justice Sikiru Oyinloye by the Ilorin Zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC.
