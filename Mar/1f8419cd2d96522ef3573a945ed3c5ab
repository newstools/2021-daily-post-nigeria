Governor Ikpeazu Okezie has taken a swipe at Senator Orji Uzor Kalu for claiming that the infrastructure currently being executed in Aba is being done by the federal government. Kalu, who represents Abia North at the Senate was accused of deliberately spreading falsehood to sway victory for his younger brother, Mascot even when he truly knows that the federal government was not contributing a dime to the building and rebuilding of the internal roads and other infrastructure being built in Aba. Reacting, Ikpeazu in a tweet on Monday, said that Kalu should not be blamed because he was in prison when the infrastructure kicked off in the state. “I heard that some people are saying that the roads we did in Aba were paid for by the Federal Government through them. “Please don’t be angry at such people, they were in prison when we flagged off those roads and they are not used to seeing such roads in Aba “By the time they came out of prison and saw those beautiful roads, they didn’t believe that such roads could be done in Aba and fully paid for by our government. Please forgive them.”
