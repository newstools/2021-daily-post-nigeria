Security operatives saved the Surulere Baptist School in Ilorin on Monday from being set ablaze by unidentified hoodlums. The school also has a church located within the premises. DAILY POST correspondent gathered that the unidentified hoodlums set tyres on fire and hurled them into the school premises at about 5pm. However, vigilant security operatives at the scene acted promptly to put off the fire that would have caused major damage to the structures. No arrest was made, but security has been beefed up around the ten Christian mission schools in Ilorin shut down by the state government following the hijab controversy between Muslim and Christian communities in the State. When contacted on Tuesday morning, the spokesman of the State police command, Mr Okasanmi Ajayi, confirmed the development. He said the Police Commissioner, Mr Mohammed Lawal Bagega, directed the DPO in-charge of the area, “To clear all unused tyres within the area, and beef up security.” Ajayi, who said no arrest was made, told DAILY POST that, the policemen at the scene retrieved the tyres, put the fire off and put the situation under control. To avert a major breakdown of law and order, the government on Monday ordered the extension of the closure of the ten schools involved. ”They were expected to have resumed classes on Monday, but the heightened tension over the hijab issue compelled the government to extend the closure indefinitely. The Christian community has insisted that no hijab dress code would be allowed in their schools and wants government to hand over the schools to their owners.
