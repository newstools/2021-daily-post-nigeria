“Boss!”. You must have heard this word when acquaintances and friends greet you after a successful ordeal in a way that sends your self-esteem skyrocketing. But who is a true “boss”? Is it just about money or more? Yes, money makes the world go round. It keeps you living the life you want. Think about it; it keeps your lights on, keeps your children in school, the goods in your shop safe and so much more. It may not be the centre of genuine happiness but it can put you on a path of contentment that leads you there. This means that you have a means that helps you create wealth and helps you stay in control of your bills to maintain the balance. This is why we have the Leadway Smart Cash Plan (LSCP).
