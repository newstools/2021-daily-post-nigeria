Former Super Eagles winger, George Finidi, has criticized coach of the national team, Gernot Rohr, over the list of players invited for this month’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho. Finidi, who specifically singled out captain Ahmed Musa, said players who are not playing regularly should not be invited ahead of those who are fit. He further questioned why Paul Onuachu does not get game time in the national team despite his form for his club. “Coaches should be made to defend their list when they come up with names that are questionable. Coaches should not be left alone. “They should be made to explain how they arrived at certain decisions on who they invite. Journalists should question the names on the list,” Finidi said according to SportingLife.
