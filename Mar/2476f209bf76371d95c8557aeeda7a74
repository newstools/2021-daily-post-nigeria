MACBAN Chairman in the state, Bello Garba urged the state government to make provision for ranches as a way of putting an end to persistent crisis between farmers and herdsmen. Garba spoke during a public hearing on a bill to regulate rearing and grazing of livestock and provide for the establishment of ranches and other related matters in Akure, on Wednesday, NAN reports. He said that the association would “support any peaceful move to address the issue in the state, and farmers and herdsmen must carry out their respective activities without clashing. “The association has been begging the state government to register Fulani men in all the local government area of the state.” Also, Ibrahim Abdul-Rahman, the Assistant Secretary of the association in the state said “open grazing had become obsolete and needed to be banned.” Abdul-Rahman asked all stakeholders to embrace modern cattle rearing technique. He said: “Farmers and herders must allow peace to reign, considering the importance of both parties to nation’s growth.”
