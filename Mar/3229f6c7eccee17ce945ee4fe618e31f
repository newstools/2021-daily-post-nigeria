Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar has said he is delighted over the release of Jangebe school girls in Zamfara State.
Atiku in a tweet on Tuesday congratulated the Zamfara State government and those who worked to release the girls. He, however, added that no citizen deserved to be kidnapped. He also prayed for the safe release of other abducted people. He said, ”As a father, I am delighted at the release of 279 students of GGSS Jangebe. Even as I rejoice with the families of the released, I hope and pray that the balance of the girls would soon regain their freedom and be rejoined with their families and loved ones. ”No student, parent or indeed citizen should go through this ordeal again. ”I congratulate the Zamfara State government and all those who worked in synergy to secure the safe return of these girls. ”I am convinced that the government will secure the release of the rest of the victims. The bigger task is to ensure that these kinds of incidents do not happen again, and that is an objective that the federal government should take the lead.”
