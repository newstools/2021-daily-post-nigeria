Zamfara State Police Command has condemned a video clip circulating on social media over alleged presence of bandits around Kungurki village of Kaura Namoda Local Government Area of the State. The clip claimed that the bandits were attempting to attack the village, which necessitated the communities to mobilize and defend themselves. According to the police spokesman in the state, SP Mohammed Shehu, the message contained in the video clip was completely false, and a calculated attempt to insert fear and confusion into the minds of the people of the State and to further portray the State in a bad light. He said, “while the Police is poised to deepening amity in the State through dialogue and reconciliation between warring communities, some unpatriotic persons from Kungurki village of Kaura Namoda Local Government Area who misunderstood the peace building process through engagement and dialogue carried dangerous weapons such as Dane guns, cutlasses, sticks and blocked a feeder road with an attempt to attack the Kaura Namoda peace Committee headed by the DPO who were coming back from stakeholders’ meeting held at Kungurki today 6th March 2021. “But in the video clip they recorded, the miscreants changed the narrative and claimed that bandits were around their village trying to attack them which necessitated them to mobilize and confront the bandits to defend themselves. “This uncivilised act of spreading false information by conflict entrepreneurs in order to create disaffection and disrupt the existing peace of the State will not be taken with levity as any person or group found to have participated in the act or sponsored others to participate will definitely face the full wrath of the law. “The Command urges members of the public to disregard the video clip and go about their legitimate endeavours. Other communities are also enjoined to disregard this unpatriotic practice by the communities of Kungurki, so that they cannot be used in the same manner by some unscrupulous elements who are not happy to see the State in peace and stability.”
