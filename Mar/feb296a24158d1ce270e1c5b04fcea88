Armed bandits have allegedly kidnapped 49 persons in Rafi and Wushishi Local Governments Areas of Niger State. DAILY POST gathered that the bandits rode on motorcycles and parked far away from the village, while they walked to the village and unleashed attack while they were fast asleep. It was gathered some of the bandits were left behind to watch over the motorcycles while others trekked into the village to carry out the dastardly act. Eyewitnesses said upon arrival, the bandits moved from house to house, woke their victims up, stole their property and walked them out to where they parked their motorcycles. Efforts to contact the Chairman of Rafi Local Government, Alhaji Ismaila Modibo Kagara for reaction on the matter were abortive. In a similar development, bandits abducted 19 natives of Kutunku in Jangaru Village in Wushishi Local Government Area of the state. The gunmen stormed the area in the early hours of Monday, shooting sporadically to scare away the people. Victims abducted were made up of eleven male and eight female. One of the residents of the area told DAILY POST that the gunmen beat up a lot of people during the attack. The resident also stated that among the eight women abducted, two of them were supposed to be married off this weekend. It was further learnt that the bandits have not contacted the families of the abductees. A senior local government official in the area who would not want his name mentioned, confirmed the development. He said, “We heard about the invasion of the village by bandits and kidnapped some persons. A report has been sent to the Divisional Police Officer in Zungeru, but we are yet to hear from him. It is quite unfortunate.” Meanwhile, the Public Relations Officer, PRO, of the state police command, ASP Wasiu Abiodun, could not be reached for comment at the time of filing this report.
