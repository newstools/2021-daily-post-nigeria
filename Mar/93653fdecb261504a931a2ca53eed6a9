The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has accused the President Muhammadu Buhari government of hypocrisy in its approach to human rights issues in Nigeria. HURIWA, a rights advocacy group, accused the Buhari-led administration of being a “notorious human rights abuser.” The rights group pointed out that the Buhari-led government has shown its lack of commitment to Nigerians’ human rights obligations by its continuous refusal to reconstitute the Governing Council for the National Human Rights Commission for five years. A statement by HURIWA’s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko and National Media Affairs Director, Miss Zainab Yusuf said Buhari’s refusal to constitute the Commission makes all his claims to protect human rights “hypocritical and spurious.” HURIWA accused the Buhari-led government of becoming “the most notorious human rights abuser with cocktails of oppressive and suppressive tendencies.” The statement reads partly: “The president has, on one hand, made verbal commitment to allow for the transparent and accountable proceedings at the judicial panel set up by the National Human Rights Commission on the allegations of police brutality and gross Human Rights Violations by the members of the now-defunct special anti-robbery squads of the Nigerian Police Force, but on the other hand president Buhari has for five years refused to reconstitute the governing council of the National Human Rights Commission which renders the entire media shows of running the Police brutality investigative panel transparently as a dramatic deceit at best and a political hypocrisy.”
