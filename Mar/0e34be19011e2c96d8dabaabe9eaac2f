A man identified as Usman Hassan, has been arrested by the Ogun State Police Command for alleged killing and kidnapping. Hassan, who was described by the police as “a notorious kidnap kingpin”, escaped from Oyo State after killing one of his victims. It was said Hassan’s accomplices were earlier arrested in Oyo State after they kidnapped a farm owner at Solalu village and killed him despite collecting ransom, but he reportedly ran to Ogun State to hibernate. “On getting to Ogun State, he started recruiting other men to form another kidnap gang in Ogun State,” the Ogun police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi told DAILY POST on Monday. Oyeyemi said, “He ran out of luck when detectives of Ogun State police Command got information about his activity from those he had tried to recruit into his kidnap team.” It was gathered that his hideout in Imala area was stormed by police detectives and he was promptly arrested. “On interrogation, he confessed that he conspired with his biological brother, one Tahiru Usman and others to kidnap their victim in Akinyele area of Ibadan and that they decided to kill the man after collecting ransom because the man can identify them.”
