Tammy Abraham and Thiago Silva will be missing for Chelsea, when they travel to Leeds United in Saturday’s early kick off. The Blues go to Elland Road in search of a third successive Premier League win. Chelsea’s win over Everton cemented their spot in the top-four, meaning a win against Leeds, who have lost their last two matches without scoring, would see them move into third-place, ahead of Leicester City, but only on goal-difference. After missing seven games with a thigh problem, Silva was named on the bench against Everton. However, he has since suffered a setback, meaning he will miss the clash with the Whites. Abraham also missed the win over Everton because of an ankle injury and he still not fit enough to be considered available for a return. Ben Chilwell, N’Golo Kante and Mason Mount will be amongst those targeting returns after dropping out of the starting line-up against Everton. Full Chelsea squad available to face Leeds United:
Goalkeepers: Edouard Mendy, Kepa Arrizabalaga & Willy Caballero. Defenders: Reece James, Cesar Azpilicueta, Antonio Rudiger, Kurt Zouma, Andreas Christensen, Ben Chilwell, Marcos Alonso & Emerson Palmieri. Midfielders: Hakim Ziyech, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Jorginho, N’Golo Kante, Mateo Kovacic, Billy Gilmour, Mason Mount, Kai Havertz & Faustino Anjorin. Strikers: Timo Werner & Olivier Giroud.
