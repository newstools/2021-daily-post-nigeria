Pastor Bulus Yakuru of the Church of the Brethren (EYN) has been freed by Boko Haram. He is with the Department of State Services (DSS). It was gathered that the agency and the Kalthum Foundation for Peace negotiated his release. The cleric regained freedom on the day he was to be executed. Yakuru was abducted on Christmas Eve, when insurgents attacked Pemi village in Borno State. No fewer than six people were murdered. Last Wednesday, the Abubakar Shekau-led faction of Boko Haram issued a one-week ultimatum to the government to meet its demands. Yakuru, in a video, appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Babagana Zulum and the Christian leadership to intervene. The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), several organizations and individuals called for his rescue. CAN President, Rev. Samson Ayokunle, stated that Yakuruâ€™s case was a litmus test for the new Service Chiefs. Ayokunle said he should not end like Rev. Lawan Andimi. In January 2020, Boko Haram murdered Andimi. He was District Chairman of the EYN and CAN Chairman of Michika LGA in Adamawa State.
