Former President of the Senate, Senator David Mark, has reacted to the recent attack on Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, and the general insecurity in the country. Senator Mark, who has been silent for a while now, urged security operatives to step up to the challenges of securing lives and property to avoid the consequences of a resort to self-help. Mark, in a statement by paul Mumeh, his Media Adviser on Sunday, said the inability of the government and security agencies to tackle the current security crisis, would compel Nigerians to embark on self-help. According to him, “If a state Governor can be so brazenly attacked, what would they not do to the ordinary citizens. “Let me state clearly that Benue people are receptive and accommodating. But this should not be misconstrued or mistaken for weakness. Enough of this malady. “That is the situation, we cannot contemplate and must not be allowed to happen because the consequences would be catastrophic.” Mark, who was the longest serving Senate President, urged the governor to ensure that he beefs up security to protect the lives and properties of the Benue people. According to him, Governor Ortom has lived up to his oath of office, adding that the governor had never compromised the protection of lives and properties of his people. Mark also urged citizens of the state to be security conscious and ensure they provide intelligence that can aid the security agencies in fighting the criminal elements. Recall that Governor Samuel Ortom was on Saturday attacked by suspected herdsmen while he was returning from his farm along Gboko-Makurdi road.
