Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, has alleged that the group that claimed responsibility for the attack on Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, Fulani Nationality Movement, FUNAM, is closely affiliated to Islamic State of Iraq and Syria West Africa, ISIS. Fani-Kayode claimed that foreign sponsors determined to destabilize Nigeria are sponsoring FUNAM. Ortom was attacked by militia in his farm along Makurdi- Gboko road, on Saturday. Claiming responsibility, FUNAM had said they tried to assassinate Ortom because he is against Fulani agenda in Nigeria. However, Fani-Kayode called on the federal government to declare FUNAM a terrorist organization in Nigeria. The former minister also called for the arrest of those associated with the group. In a series of tweets, Fani-Kayode wrote: “FUNAM, who have claimed responsibility for the attack on and attempted assassination of Governor Ortom of Benue state, is a foreign-based, foreign-sponsored and foreign-manned counterintelligence operation whose sole purpose is to destabilize and destroy Nigeria. “They are closely affiliated with ISIS West Africa and often share intelligence and collaborate with them in joint operations. Though they do have a few local allies, in the main they do not represent the Fulani of Nigeria but only the foreign Fulani terrorists and their international backers who want to throw Nigeria into chaos, drive us into a civil war and cause us to slaughter one another so that they can come into our country in full force and pick up the pieces. “Ortom must be fully protected and the Federal Government must shut down FUNAM in Nigeria, declare them a terrorist organization and arrest or eliminate all their members, friends and associates before they push us into an avoidable and horrific full-scale civil war.”
