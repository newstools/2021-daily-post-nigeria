Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has called on more private investors within and outside the country to come to the state to explore investment opportunities available. The Governor who made the call on Monday while on a working visit to a Biotech firm in the state, said the importance of industries to the economic development of Nigeria could not be overemphasised. He noted that many youths would be provided with jobs through industries, stressing that such would, in turn, reduce insecurity occasioned by restiveness and also create wealth along the value chain. Governor Ortom who accepted the apologies of the company which did not follow laid down government procedures to acquire and develop the land, however, urged its management to immediately erect a signpost to educate the people about their activities. The Governor also charged the host community to provide security for the facility, even as he directed security agencies to provide surveillance and patrols to attract more investors to the state.
