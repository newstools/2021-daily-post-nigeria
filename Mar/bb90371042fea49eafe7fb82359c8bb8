Isaac Drogba, the son of Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba, has scored his first professional goal and also copied his father’s iconic celebration. The 20-year-old Isaac smashed the ball into the roof of the net from close range to hand fourth-tier Italian club Folgore Caratese a 1-0 win over Caronnese. The goal is Isaac’s first in the league after being teed up in the box by one of his team-mates. He then copied his dad’s iconic celebration by wheeling away from his team-mates while pumping his arms out wide. The youngster has made a promising start to his professional career, despite being released by Chelsea back in 2018. He then followed in his dad’s footsteps by signing for French club Guingamp, only to be released last summer without a single appearance. Isaac joined Caratese in February and made his professional debut for the Serie D club the same month. Video:   A post shared by nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen)
