Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Anambra State, Mr Ndubuisi Nwobu has said all governorship aspirants of the party must pay N5 million administrative fee before they can qualify to purchase the expression of interest and nomination forms. Nwobu said any aspirant who is yet to pay should not be considered as an aspirant of the party for the forthcoming governorship election. He stated this during an interactive meeting for national, state, local government and ward leaders of the party in Awka. “The party in the state has announced a N5 million administrative fee on all those running for governor on the platform of the party, which must be paid before proceeding to the National Secretariat, Abuja to obtain the expression of interest and nomination forms. “So far, 11 aspirants have paid the fee. Anyone who was yet to pay should not be considered as an aspirant in the forthcoming primary election of the party. “Aspirants who have paid include; Dr Obiora Okonkwo, Hon Chris Azubogu, Senator Uche Ekwunife, Mr Winston Udeh, Mr Godwin Ezeemo, Mr Valentine Ozigbo, Emeka Etiaba (SAN), Dr Godwin Maduka, Mr Ifedi Okwenna, Hon Tony Nwoye and daughter of Dr Alex Ekwueme, Mrs Chidi Onyemelukwe.” Nwobu said the reason for the interactive meeting was to thank the local government and ward leaders of the party, saying their contribution at the grassroots level has made the party in the state formidable. He said the party plans to hold training for all ward and local government executives of the party soon, which will focus on how to canvass for support for the party, voting processes, protection of votes among others. He also told the members of the party that a ward to ward tour would commence soon, urging members to go to their various wards and canvass for support to the party.
