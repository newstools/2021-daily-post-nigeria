Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu and the immediate past National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, met at the weekend. Both politicians met at the church service of the burial of former Secretary to the Edo State Government (SSG), Dr Simon Imuekheme. Oshiomhole and Shaibu buried their differences and spoke well of each other at the event. This is coming barely one week after Shaibu said, among other things, that he made sure Oshiomhole and his co-travellers fell by the roadside. He had said that the former Governor was attempting to reintroduce godfatherism which they both fought against. When Oshiomhole entered the church and was greeted with a loud ovation and Shaibu immediately rose to greet him, they were momentarily engaged in a discussion and became the cynosure of all eyes before going their ways. The deputy governor while speaking, complimented Oshiomhole which was also reciprocated by the former governor.
