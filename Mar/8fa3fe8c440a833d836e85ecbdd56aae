The Lagos State Government has announced that all vehicular movement around the Teslim Balogun Stadium, the venue of the live football match between the Super Eagles of Nigeria and Crocodiles of Lesotho will be closed on Tuesday. The Commissioner of Transportation Dr. Frederic Oladeinde made this known on Monday. He said the closure will last for 12 hours to effectively manage traffic and tighten security at the stadium. He assured motorists that provisions have been made to manage traffic along the axis for the 12 hours period. “In line with this development, motorists are advised to avoid moving around the stadium from 10.00am. Traffic approaching Teslim Balogun from Ojuelegba and Alaka/Eric Moore can only pass through the flyover. The statement informed that only vehicles with VVIP stickers or tickets would be allowed to approach the stadium and park. “Also vehicles conveying persons with VVIP tickets would be permitted to drive into the Teslim Balogun Stadium,” the statement added. Oladeinde urged motorists to cooperate with the LASTMA officials deployed to manage the traffic flow at the axis to ease movement and minimize expected inconveniences.
