Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has confirmed speculation that the club is interested in re-signing Cristiano Ronaldo this summer. Ronaldo signed for Juventus from Real in 2018 for a fee of around £100m. But the 36-year-old has failed to deliver the Champions League trophy that the Serie A club craves during his three years in Turin. Juventus were knocked out by Porto last week, raising question marks over Ronaldo’s future in Italy. The Portugal captain has one year to run on his deal and the club risks losing him on a free transfer next summer. Zidane has admitted they may bring Ronaldo back to the Santiago Bernabeu. When asked if there’s any truth in the reports about Ronaldo, Zidane said: “Yes, there may be. “We know Cristiano, we know the person he is and everything he has done here. “But now he’s a Juventus player and we must respect this. “Now, let’s see what the future will be. I was lucky enough to coach him and he is very impressive. Right now, he’s helping Juventus.”
