Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has criticized striker, Tammy Abraham, ahead of the Blues’ Premier League clash with Liverpool on Thursday night at Anfield. Tuchel said Abraham, who was not included in his 18-man squad for the match against Manchester United last Sunday, lacks luck not only in games but in training. The former Paris-Saint-Germain coach said his job was to push the England international to his limits. The German said this during his pre-match press conference on Wednesday. Tuchel said, “It’s my job to push him [Tammy Abraham] to his limits. We will not stop doing this and supporting him. It was a tough decision, but we have to make these decisions. It’s a part of my job I do not like, but at the same, I like it because it means everybody is available. “We communicate these decisions clearly. We have to cut it down to 18 players. It’s not always a punishment or a signal, and that was the case here. It was just a choice from alternatives. “He lacks a bit of luck, Tammy, not only in games but also in training, and once the last touch comes back, he will be a player we will push forward.”
