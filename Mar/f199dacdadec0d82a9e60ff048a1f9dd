Former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has appealed to Nigerians to support the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in the 2023 general election. The former governor of Kwara State, made the appeal on Friday while inaugurating some projects executed by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State in Asaba the state capital. Saraki who lamented the current security situation of the country expressed hope that the opposition party would do better in the fight against insurgency if given the opportunity again. The former senate president who lauded governor Okowa over the projects, said there are still remnants of PDP faithful who has capacity and integrity like the governor. Saraki said the Nigerian economy would pick up again after the support of Nigerians to ensure that the party takes over leadership from President Muhammadu Buhari. According to him: “It gives me great pleasure to be here and to be part of this inauguration. For four years in the Senate, we sat next to each other and I worked very closely with you when we passed the National Health Bill; I am very pleased with your performance here in Delta. “It is on record that in our party, anytime we have difficult assignments we come to you because of your competence, integrity and commitment to duty. “Our country is passing through some difficulties and I appeal to Nigerians to give PDP the chance again to lead Nigeria and you will see the difference. “Your administration’s commitment to the growth and development of Asaba capital city is laudable and commendable”.
