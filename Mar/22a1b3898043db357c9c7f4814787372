Former Barcelona Sporting Director, Eric Abidal, has said that Lionel Messi will not leave the club. This is despite the fact that Messi is yet to commit to a new contract at the club. Abidal is not convinced that there would be “something better” for the iconic Argentine away from Camp Nou. Mess is heading towards free agency in Catalunya and will be making no decision on his future until the 2020-21 campaign comes to a close. “…He played his full career in Barcelona, so for that it is important to stay because he’s the key player,” he told the Telegraph. “But, as well, his idea will depend on the rest of the squad, the new project, the new ideas of the new board and their ideas for the coach, for example. And if, in the end, he can feel comfortable in this. “But it will be his decision and it’s not easy when you spend many, many years in the same club, sometimes you want to see something else. But will there be something better than Barcelona for him? I don’t know,” the Frenchman said. Recall that Abidal and Messi clashed in 2020 following the Frenchman’s criticism of Barcelona stars over their work ethics at the club. Abidal had slammed Messi and others saying that they were not giving their best for the Catalan giants, adding that there was a problem of communication in Barca dressing room. He hinted that the players and their coaches were not in good relationship and his comments angered the Argentina superstar, who believes he has given and is still giving his all to the Blaugrana. Messi had responded by telling Abidal to face his work and mention names whenever he talks about Barca players.
