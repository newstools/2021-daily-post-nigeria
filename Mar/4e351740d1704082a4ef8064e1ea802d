President Muhammadu Buhari is currently presiding over the National Security Council (NSC) meeting in the Executive Council Chambers of the Presidential Villa in Abuja. The meeting is the first NSC meeting Buhari would be holding with the new service chiefs after their appointment in late January and screening/confirmation by the National Assembly in February. The meeting is holding at the Council Chambers of the State House, Abuja. VP Osinbajo, Secretary to the Govt of the Federation, Chief of Defence Staff, Defence Minister, other Service Chiefs, the IG of Police and other heads of the security agencies are all in attendance. This is coming less than 24 hours after Buhari expressed overwhelming joy over the release of the abducted female students in Zamfara State.
