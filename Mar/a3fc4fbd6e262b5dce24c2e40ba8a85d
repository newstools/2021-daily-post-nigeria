The lawmaker representing Egbado North/Imeko Afon federal constituency of Ogun State, Jimoh Olaefa has dumped the African Democratic Congress (ADC) for the All Progressives Congress (APC). Olaifa’s defection was announced by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila who announced the defection in a letter addressed to the House. He cited “conflict and irreconcilable differences” with his party as the reason for his defection. “I’ll rather join the APC that will have my people benefit from dividend of democracy,” he said. Challenging the defection, the Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechukwu faulted the lawmaker’s action.
