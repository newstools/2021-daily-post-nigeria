The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has said that Nigerians under the age of 18 years will not receive the COVID-19 vaccines in the country. The Minister of State for Health, Olorunnimbe Mamora, who made this known in an interview with newsmen said that the Federal Government has plans to give out the vaccine to 70 per cent of Nigerians within two years, NAN reports. Mamora warned that private organisations were not permitted to procure, distribute and administer the coronavirus vaccines. According to him, the PTF has also approved the TEACH strategy and the electronic management immunisation system for managing the four million vaccines yet to arrive in the country. Mamora said that the TEACH approach entails a traditional method of vaccinating target populations using desk review of available data sources, identifying the vaccination sites and roll out. He described the strategy as innovative to ensure a smooth rollout so that no one was left behind. Mamora, however, warned against private importation of vaccines adding that only the National Primary Health Care Development Agency would import and manage vaccines until further notice.
