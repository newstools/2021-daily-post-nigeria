The Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has appealed for an end to killings in Nigeria. He also cautioned Nigerian leaders to be careful of their comments and actions ahead of the 2023 presidency. At a meeting of Yoruba leaders in Ibadan on Wednesday, Makinde said the nation must be peaceful for smooth general elections. He stated that 2023 should not be the main discourse in the polity now but how to deliver dividends of democracy to Nigerians. “Some are saying that the Presidency should be zoned to the South-West in 2023 and making some unfounded comments.” Makinde condemned violence and insecurity across the nation, insisting “it is needless to spill the blood of innocent people”. “Like our fathers will say ‘wisdom surpasses power’. If we fail to apply wisdom, I pray none of us will be collateral damage.” The Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, advised the Yoruba people to work together and speak with one voice. He appealed to South-West governors to lay more emphasis on infrastructure, security and creation of job opportunities for youths.
