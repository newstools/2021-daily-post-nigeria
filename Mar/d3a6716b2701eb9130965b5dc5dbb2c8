The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA seized 200 kilograms of illicit substances at the Lagos, Kano and Abuja airports last week. The agency’s Director, Media and Advocacy, Mr Femi Babafemi, confirmed this in a statement issued on Sunday in Abuja. He stated that a 41-year-old Adewuyi Olayinka was arrested while trying to export 650 grams of cocaine to the United Kingdom. The drugs concealed in dry pepper and herbal concoction were supposed to be taken through the Skyway Aviation Handling Company export shed at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. “In the same vein, 107kg of hard drugs suspected to be Khat was seized at the cargo shed of the Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano, while being exported to Canada. “The drug, which weighed 107kg, was concealed in golden colour cellophane bags covered with textile materials and labelled as tea with a view to deceive and mislead our officers. “The so-called tea raised the suspicion of officers at the cargo shed who insisted that it must be subjected to laboratory analysis before it will be allowed to go. “The shipment was delayed until a sample was taken to our forensic laboratory for analysis. The result came out positive for Khat. It has since been seized and is now in our custody,’’ he added. Babafemi also said an attempt by a trafficker to export 92.250kg of Khat using the Abuja airport was hindered too. He stated that the clearing agent processing the consignment for export lied that the cargo was dried moringa leaves, but upon laboratory tests, it turned out to be hard drugs. “The hard drug which was confiscated was packed in six cartons heading to Goussainville in France.
