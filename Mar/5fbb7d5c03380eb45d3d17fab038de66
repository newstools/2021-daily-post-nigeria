Chuks Ibegbu, a former Deputy spokesman of the Igbo socio-political organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, on Friday, lambasted President Muhammadu Buhari over the spate of insecurity in Nigeria. Ibegbu said Buhari lacks the powers to tackle insecurity in the country due to his analogue mindset. Speaking with DAILY POST, Ibegbu insisted that the president’s failure to properly constitute the country’s security architecture and lack of proactive nature has contributed to Nigeria’s insecurity challenges. According to the former Ohanaeze Deputy Spokesman: “Recently, he ordered a shoot-at-sight of people wielding AK-47 and also changed Service Chiefs, this showed that he is concerned about the situation of insecurity. “However, he also contributed to it because the security architecture was not properly constituted, it favoured one part of the country and that was not good enough for the leader of a country to be nepotic in security appointments but despite the recent steps he’s taking, it’s not enough. “He should look into the decentralization of police because security is all about the grassroot, involving the traditional rulers, youth leaders in all the various segments of the society, I think the president is now waking up. “Buhari does not have all the attributes of a leader that is proactive and he is not very proactive on issues. He is sectional in his approach to issues. “We live in a digital age, but the president operates in an analogue age, I think his mindset is analogue and that is a very big challenge to Nigeria because we need to forget about sectionality and allow people with digital mindset, Buhari does not have it.”
