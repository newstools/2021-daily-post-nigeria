Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has lauded a gospel artiste, Mr. Mike Jerusalem, for his propagation of the gospel and written works. Governor Ortom spoke on Saturday at Dream Event Centre Makurdi during the public presentation and launching of a book entitled: “Ortom, the triumph of a prophetic political victory,” written by Mr Mike Jerusalem. The event also coincided with the presentation of an award to the Governor as Champion of the Anti-Open Grazing Law Phenomenon, owing to his untiring efforts in the promotion of ranching in the country. The Governor expressed appreciation to Dr Mike Jerusalem for authoring a book in his honour and apologised for it’s late presentation which he noted would have been done in 2019. Governor Ortom encouraged Benue people to venture into things that could better their lives, adding that faith without works is dead. Author of the book, Mr Mike Jerusalem said Governor Ortom had made history as the champion of ranching in Benue and Nigeria at large, pointing out that he had distinguished himself and deserved to be celebrated. Professor David Iornem, Mr Peter Shande, Dr Jiji Jack, Dr Sam Abah, Mr Israel New Jerusalem, Bishop Mike Angough and Reverend Mashika Agu were also presented with awards for distinguishing themselves in various endeavours.
