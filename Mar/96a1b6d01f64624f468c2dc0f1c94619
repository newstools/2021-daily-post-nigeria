The Federal Capital Territory Police Command has refuted claims that 20 persons were kidnapped in the Zuba area of Abuja. A statement issued by the spokesperson of the Command, Mariam Yusuf, on Wednesday said there was no abduction on Tuesday 30th March 2021. Yusuf claimed in the statement that “The attention of the FCT Police Command has been drawn to some malicious publications being circulated in some sections of the social media targeted at creating palpable tension amongst well-spirited residents of the FCT, with particular reference to the alleged ‘kidnap of twenty (20) persons along Zuba axis’. “It is unfortunate that these elements are unmindful of the frantic effort including proactive and reactive measures put in place by the Command in collaboration with key Community Stakeholders to tackle the emerging security challenges in the FCT. “Furthermore, it is worthy of note that, in its bid to rid the city of all forms of criminality, the Command has foiled several attempts by hoodlums to breach the peace of the FCT and arrested over 90 suspects between January-March 2021 in connection with different criminal activities including kidnapping, armed robbery, one chance robbery etc.” The Command urged residents to remain calm, law-abiding and verify every information to avoid circulating fake news. The Command tasked residents to report all suspicious movements, emergency or distress through designated police numbers as well as report the conduct of Police Officers at the Police Public Complaint Bureau.
