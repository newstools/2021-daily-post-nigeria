The Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, has warned against the blockade of foodstuff from the North to the Southern part of Nigeria. Chief Audu Ogbe, National Chairman ACF, warned such a step would complicate the economic and political state of Nigeria. In a statement, Ogbe insisted that such action was unnecessary because Nigeria was not at war. According to Ogbe: “Nigeria is not at war with itself and such a drastic action is not necessary. “This will only further complicate the socio economic and political problems facing our country today. “We believe that whatever may be the difficulties of their members in operating in other parts of the country, ACF leadership led by me is willing to help them solve these by talking to security agencies and the government. “There is no need to mount a blockade by one section of the country against the other. Whatever may be our differences, the ACF as an ardent believer in free trade believes that goods should be allowed to move freely. “This extreme measure is not progressive and even counterproductive. This is not the way to go.” The Amalgamated Union of Foodstuff and cattle dealers had vowed to stop movements of food from the north to the south. Also, the Coordinator of the Kwara State chapter of Miyetti Allah Association of Cattle Breeders, MACBAN, Aliyu Mohammed had said that the blockage of cattle and foodstuffs to the South West will continue. Aliyu had said the blockade will continue until the safety of Fulani is guaranteed in the Southwest.
