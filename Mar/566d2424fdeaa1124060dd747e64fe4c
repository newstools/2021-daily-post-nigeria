Ralph Uwazurike, leader of the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), has warned that Igbos cannot afford another war. Uwazurike spoke at a press conference in Owerri, Imo State capital on Monday. He also cautioned leader of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, against inciting Igbo youths against the nation’s security agencies. Uwazurike warned the South-East to shun Kanu’s agitation, NAN reports. He described the IPOB leader as a “nobody, who only wants to put them in harm’s way”. “Those agitating for war know they can’t defeat Nigeria but they want to enrich themselves, so they have continued to deceive our youth. “Igbo’s cannot afford to go to another war with Nigeria and at no point should they be incited into hostilities with the rest of Nigeria. “Mobilising youths against their leaders and constituted authority is what we should guard against because we cannot defeat Nigeria,” Uwazurike said. The MASSOB leader advised the governors to take over the Eastern Security Network (ESN) to ensure the outfit was not deployed for mischievous purposes. Uwazurike suggested that the network be trained and equipped and made to work in synergy with the police and other security agencies.
