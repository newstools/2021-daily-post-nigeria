Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has admitted he is happy to avoid Manchester City and Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-final draw. The Reds have been drawn against Real Madrid in what is a repeat of the 2018 Final. All the English sides were kept apart. Chelsea drew Porto, while City face Borussia Dortmund. Klopp told the club’s official website : “I think we are all the same: Bayern doesn’t want to play Dortmund, for example, because they are from the same country and for us, it was City and Chelsea. “If we can avoid as long as possible then you do it, but all the rest, it was clear we would face a tough opponent.”
