Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has expressed his concerns over players leaving on international duties in March. The UK Government currently requires people returning from a trip to a ‘red list’ country to quarantine for 10 days. Many Premier League players are set to head off abroad to link up with their national teams. Included on the red list is Portugal, large parts of Africa and the whole of South America. This means the likes of Thiago Silva and Edouard Mendy could be unavailable for a spell and Tuchel has suggested he could block players from leaving. “I am absolutely worried because my target is to play in the Premier League and if I have players in quarantine, I cannot build the group that we want,” Tuchel said after his side’s 1-0 win over Liverpool on Thursday. “This is the risk and I am absolutely worried about this situation. But I am also sure that the club knows how to handle it. If it maybe is the consequence that the players cannot go then this is the consequence. “This situation is extraordinary. We have to adapt and we will do this as a club and we will make these decisions. We are very concerned about the situation.”
