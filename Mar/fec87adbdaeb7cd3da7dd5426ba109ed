Chelsea board have been pleased with manager, Thomas Tuchel’s impact on three players who flopped under former Blues coach, Frank Lampard. According to ESPN, the three players Chelsea hierarchy are delighted with Tuchel’s impact are Kai Havertz, Timo Werner and Marcos Alonso. Havertz, Werner and Alonso have improved and have featured regularly for Chelsea since Tuchel was appointed. Tuchel has not lost a match in his eleven games in charge of Chelsea since he replaced Lampard last January. Meanwhile, Christian Pulisic is one of the high-profile players in Chelsea that is yet to feature regularly for Tuchel. Speaking about Pulisic on Friday, Tuchel said at his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea’s clash with Leeds United on Saturday, “If he [Pulisic] starts tomorrow if he does brilliantly if he starts again against Atletico, and if he scores two goals… maybe he’s the captain next year of our squad [laughs]. “I know what you mean, but this is too far ahead. We have so many games, and he is in my plans. ‘He is an important player.”
