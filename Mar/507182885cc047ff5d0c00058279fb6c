The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has said it shutdown 86 Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) plants in Lagos State in 2020 for operating illegally. Mr Paul Osu, Head, Public Affairs, DPR made this known in a statement issued on Wednesday in Lagos, NAN reports. Osu said the LPG (cooking gas) plants were shutdown for non-compliance with international safety standards. According to him, the plants were also operating without approval or licence from the regulatory agency. “Some of the sealed plants were operating under high tension electrical installations and other unapproved locations. “Also, the move was aimed at reducing the occurrence of gas explosion and fire incidents in the State. “Moreso, we would like to notify the public that DPR would continue to clamp down on such illegal plants,” he said. He advised that people should learn the need for safe usage and distribution of gas.
