Neither Lionel Messi nor Cristiano Ronaldo will play in the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since the 2004/2005 season.

A day before, Porto stunned Juventus and Ronaldo, to advance on away goals in Turin. The last time both Messi and Ronaldo missed the last eight of the competition, Barca were eliminated by Chelsea in the last 16. Ronaldo, who was with Manchester United at the time, lost to AC Milan in the round of 16. Overall, Ronaldo has won the Champions League five times, while Messi has won the competition on four occasions â€“ most recently in 2014-15.
