A Nigerian, Ifaokurola Babalawo, Shedrack Luke Greeson, has been convicted for fraud. Justice Musa Usman of the Federal Capital Territory High Court, Bwari, Abuja, sentenced him to 3 months in prison. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested Babalawo in January 2021 for scam while posing as a spiritualist on social media. He was arraigned on March 22 on a two-count charge bordering on obtaining by false pretence. EFCC said Babalawo, via his Instagram account, induced Austin Brown, an American in California, to pay N230,000. The offence was contrary to section 320(b) and punishable under section 322 of the Penal Code Act, Laws of the Federation (Abuja) 1990. Babalawo pleaded ‘guilty’ to the charge and entered into a plea bargain with the EFCC. Justice Usman, however, gave him an option of fine N50,000 after restitution.
