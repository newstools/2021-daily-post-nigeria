YouTube has announced plans to start deducting taxes from creators outside the United States on the earnings they generate from viewers in the US. The company made this known in an email to creators. The additional tax may come into effect from June, 2021. YouTube also demanded that creators submit their tax information in AdSense “to determine the correct amount of taxes to deduct”. “If your tax info is not provided by May 31st, 2021, Google may be required to deduct up to 24 per cent of your total earnings worldwide,” the email read. YouTube added that its parent company, Google had the responsibility under Chapter three of the US Internal Revenue Code to receive tax information, withhold taxes, and report to the Internal Revenue Service when a creator earned royalty revenue from viewers in the US.
