Arsenal hero, Nwankwo Kanu, has advised the club to hire Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry in place of current boss, Mikel Arteta. Kanu spent about five seasons at Arsenal, scoring 43 goals in 197 appearances under Arsene Wenger. Kanu told Ladbrokes: “I agree with William Gallas that Patrick Vieira would be a good fit as Arsenal’s manager because he’s Arsenal through and through. “I think the same thing about Thierry Henry. If you asked me, I’d say go and get both of them. “They’re Arsenal blood and their presence would make Arsenal a better team.” The former Super Eagles captain admitted that Arteta did a good job in winning the FA Cup last season but insisted that Arsenal deserve more.
