Manchester United will be without Anthony Martial for their next two games at least, according to L’Equipe. Martial is believed to have suffered a knee injury while on international duty with France. The forward picked up the injury during their 2-0 win over Kazakhstan in World Cup qualifying and missed their 1-0 victory against Bosnia-Herzegovina on Wednesday night. France manager, Didier Deschamps, tried to allay fears over the severity of Martial’s problem by saying it “is nothing serious”. But fresh reports say the problem with keep him out of Sunday’s Premier League game against Brighton. The 25-year-old will be a doubt for the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final against Granada next Thursday. The news will come as a blow to United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who is also likely to be without Mason Greenwood for the Brighton game, after he had to withdraw from the Under-21s European Championship last week due to injury.
