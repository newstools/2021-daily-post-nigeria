Paris Saint-German boss, Mauricio Pochettino, has said Neymar likes to fight to win, but his emotions overpowered him, after he was sent off during their 1-0 defeat to Lille last weekend. Speaking ahead of today’s Champions League quarter-final tie against Bayern Munich, Pochettino said the Brazilian was caught up in the moment in his first Ligue 1 start in over two months. “He was very excited to start a match. He’s an emotional player. “He likes to play, he likes to fight, he’s a competitor. He didn’t deserve that red,” Pochettino said. That loss saw PSG drop to second position in Ligue 1 behind Lille. But Pochettino expects Neymar to be focused for Wednesday’s match against Bayern. “He knows he has to channel himself. I hope that tomorrow everything will be fine,” Pochettino said. Pochettino also insisted PSG will not have revenge on their minds against Bayern, after losing to the Bundesliga champions in last season’s final.
