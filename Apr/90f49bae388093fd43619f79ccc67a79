The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has challenged President Muhammadu Buhari and the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu to produce an Italian man who was confirmed as Nigeria’s first coronavirus patient. Addressing his members in Akure on Sunday, Giwa said Nigerians would be glad to hear from the Italian man how he contracted Covid-19 and passed it to Nigerians. He said: “We will like to meet the Italian man who brought Covid-19 to Nigeria. When advanced countries were showing us videos of Covid-19 patients, Nigeria was showing us charts and diagrams. “We told them to rely on God, not scientists they didn’t listen. Can’t you see the results they are getting from their vaccines? “Just two weeks ago, I said they should rely on God they thought I didn’t know what I was talking about. “Let me challenge president Buhari and Babajide Sanwo-Olu to produce the Italian man immediately; let him brief Nigerians where he contracted the disease and passed it to Nigeria. “You can’t deceive me twice, you can only deceive me once. Why is everything about this government is a lie?”
