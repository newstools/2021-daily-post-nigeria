The World Health Organization (WHO) says Africa is at risk of major measles outbreaks. The global body noted that fifteen African countries delayed measles immunization drives in 2020 as they dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven have now completed the campaigns, eight remain outstanding. Between January 2020 and April 2021, an estimated 16.6 million children in Africa missed planned supplemental measles vaccine doses. Eight African countries reported major measles outbreaks that affected tens of thousands. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa noted that recent outbreaks of measles, but also yellow fever, cholera and meningitis all point to worrying gaps in immunization coverage and surveillance. “As we fight COVID-19, we cannot leave anyone dangerously exposed to preventable diseases. I urge all countries to double down on essential health services, including life-saving vaccination campaigns,” he said on Thursday at a press conference. Measles requires at least 95% immunization coverage in the population to prevent outbreaks. Only seven countries in the region achieved 95% measles-containing vaccine coverage in 2019. Africa was declared wild polio-free in 2020. Over 116 million children were vaccinated with the third dose of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine between 2015 and 2019. Moeti advocated an integrated action to increase and expand access to immunization as part of primary health care. From 24 to 30 April 2021, WHO and Member States will observe the 11th African Vaccination Week.
