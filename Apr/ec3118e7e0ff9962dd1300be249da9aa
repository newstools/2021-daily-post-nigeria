Former Manchester United captain, Gary Neville, has urged the Premier League to punish the ‘big six’ clubs who are planning to join a breakaway European Super League. According to him, all the teams involved should be docked points. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are all believed to have signed up to the new breakaway league. The other clubs include Barcelona, Real Madrid, Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan. “In the wake of Covid, it’s an absolute scandal,” Neville said on Sky Sports. “Manchester United and the rest of the big six clubs who have signed up for it should be ashamed of themselves. “The European Super League – are Arsenal in that? They’ve just drawn with Fulham! “And Manchester United are drawing with Burnley. I must admit, I can’t concentrate on the game, me. “They should be docked all the six teams that have signed up to it, deduct points off them all, to do it during a season it’s a joke.”
