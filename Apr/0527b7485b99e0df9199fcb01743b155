The President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Olasupo Ayokunle, has prayed that bandits do not attack Nigeria’s President, as they did in Chad. Ayokunle stated this while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the 108th convention of the Nigerian Baptist Convention (NBC). “I pray that our case will not be like that of Chad. Recently, you heard in the news that the bandits there, or whatever you call them, killed the president. “That means the bandits or anti-government people are having a field day. “So, we don’t need to be deceiving ourselves with the breakdown of law and order that we have presently in the nation,” the cleric said. Chad President, Idris Deby, a few days ago, died from injuries sustained at the war against rebels. Primate Elijah Ayodele, the leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, had also prophesied that more African presidents would die. Deby was the second African president who passed away, two months after John Magufuli of Tanzania died in March.
