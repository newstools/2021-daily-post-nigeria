The prize money Chelsea earned after qualifying for the Champions League semi-finals has been revealed. The Premier League giants booked their place in the Champions League last-4 on Tuesday night in Spain after seeing off Porto. Thomas Tuchel’s side lost the second leg 1-0 but headed through following a 2-1 aggregate win to set up a clash against Real Madrid or Liverpool later this month. It’s the first time since 2014 that Chelsea has made the Champions League semi-finals. However, Chelsea earned €12 million for reaching the semi-finals and seeing off Porto at the Estadio Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán. If the Blues reach the Champions League final, they will receive either a further €15 million or €19 million, depending on the outcome of the game. The latter figure if they win the competition, which would see Chelsea take home as much as €82.4 million for the 2020/21 Champions League campaign. Meanwhile, speaking after Chelsea’s victory over the two legs, the club’s manager, Thomas Tuchel, said it was a ‘very big achievement as they reached the last four for the first time in seven years. “It is a very big achievement,” Tuchel said at his post-match press conference. “You see when Chelsea was last in the semi-final. We are not used to being there. Once you are there, you play for the final. This is clear,” he said.
