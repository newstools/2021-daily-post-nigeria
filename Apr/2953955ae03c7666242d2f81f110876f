Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has assured that President Muhammadu Buhari would not extend his tenure in 2023. Tinubu said Buhari would not spend “one hour beyond his tenure” in office. He disclosed this while addressing journalists yesterday in Abuja. According to Tinubu, Buhari would respect the country’s Constitution at the end of his tenure in 2023. He said: “We cannot interject politics and assumptions into everything. We have a nation to build; we have a baton to pass. “You can depend on Buhari that he will not spend one hour beyond his tenure. He will do that. He will comply with the Constitution.” The former Lagos State governor also declared that the ruling APC has brighter chances in 2023. He assured that the ruling party would continue to work for a better Nigeria. “The chances are as bright as a midnight star. We’ll continue to work for a better Nigeria and that’s what you need,” he added.
