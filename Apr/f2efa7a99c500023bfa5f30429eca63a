President Muhammadu Buhari has assured the newly inaugurated President of Niger Republic, Mohamed Bazoum, that his administration would endeavour to end the security challenges affecting the two countries. Nigerien President, Bazoum, is currently in Nigeria on his first official international visit after winning an election. In a statement issued by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, Buhari said, “We will stabilize our region for the benefit of the two countries.” President Buhari said Nigerians and Nigeriens are people with a similar culture, language and way of life as well as share about 1,500 kilometres of land border and so we cannot ignore each other. The President congratulated Bazoum on winning the recent presidential election and his successful inauguration into office. “You have been in the system for a long time. The only thing is that you had never been President. Now you are one,” the host President said, assuring that Nigeria would assist its close neighbour in diverse ways as required. On terrorism, as perpetrated by Boko Haram, President Buhari observed that the Niger Republic also suffers high casualties, vowing to do all it takes to secure both countries. President Buhari was thankful to the immediate past President, Mahamadou Issoufou, for what he calls “his understanding and sacrifices” to help stabilize the region, urging the successor to maintain the institutions his predecessor had established. President Bazoum said he was delighted to make Nigeria his first port of call, noting that the two countries have common interests, “and, therefore, a good relationship is very important. ”On security, he observed that the fact that some Nigerians flee to Niger during terrorist attacks “shows that we need to cooperate, and we will face our challenges together.”
