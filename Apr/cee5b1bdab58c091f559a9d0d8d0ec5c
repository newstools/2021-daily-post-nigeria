The Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Kaduna State chapter, has condemned the attack on worshippers at a Sunday service as well as the abduction and killings of a medical doctor and one other in the state. The State Secretary, Rev. Caleb Ma’aji, who lamented the insecurity in Kaduna in a statement said, it was saddening that the situation has continued to get worse. “Our hearts are saddened over the sorry see security situation in our dear state (Kaduna State). ”It has grown so unfortunate and daily continues to grow worst with no appreciable resistance given the unholy terrorists who have continued to hold our dear state and nation to ransom. “Today 25th April 2021 innocent worshipers who went out for nothing but to worship and pray to God were attacked, a medical doctor and one other person were killed, many members injured and others taken into captivity.” CAN lamented that, “This is happening in a nation that allows freedom of religion yet, the freedom is not guaranteed.” The Christian group says it wonders what the crime of innocent citizens are and why the terrorists appear more free and protected than the citizens? “Our hearts go out to the local church at Manini, the Nigeria Baptist Convention and family members of the deceased, “CAN observed. It appealed to relevant agencies to investigate the attack and prayed for the safe release of the abducted members and indeed all others in captivity. CAN also enjoined all men and women of goodwill to wake up and do the needful before everyone is consumed by the ongoing evil of banditry and kidnapping that has hijacked the country especially, Kaduna State.
