Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has singled out youngster, Mason Greenwood for praise after his side’s hard-fought Premier League victory over Brighton on Sunday. Manchester United came from behind to beat the relegation-battling Brighton 2-1 with Marcus Rashford and Greenwood saving the day at Old Trafford This was after Danny Welbeck gave the visitors an early lead and the hosts struggled to find an equaliser. With seven minutes before the final whistle, Greenwood glanced Paul Pogba’s mistimed shot into the back of the net to give Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side their 17th win of the season. “Mason was mature,” Solskjaer told reporters after the game. “Today he was one of our brightest players. “‘He was clean, he was tidy and he got the goal. It’s a header inside the six-yard box and that’s what we need more from Mason. “It’s always difficult to play Brighton. We have had good results and we’ve had to earn them the hard way. We managed to find a way in the second half.”
