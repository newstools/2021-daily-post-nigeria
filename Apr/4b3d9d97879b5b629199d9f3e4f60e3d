Five friends from Adamawa State have been killed in a ghastly car accident while on their way to Kaduna State. An aide to Ahmadu Fintiri, Adamawa State Governor, Miracle Musa, made this known in a post via his Facebook account on Sunday. He said the five friends were on their way to Kaduna to attend a friend’s engagement ceremony when the crash occurred on Saturday. He informed that two of the men have been so far identified as Saddam Aje Shinguboi and Mwaniya Japhet Gajere. “Five Adamawa boys, all perished, burnt beyond recognition on their way to Kaduna for their friend’s engagement, he tweeted. “Three are from Bekaji while the other two were from Karewa GRA.,” he wrote. Meanwhile, the Senator representing Adamawa North, Ishaku Abbo, in a post via his social media account condoled with the families, friends and well-wishers of the deceased over their death.
