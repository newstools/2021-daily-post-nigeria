The Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU has condemned the attack by gunmen at the Plateau State University in Bokkos Local Government Area of the State. DAILY POST reported that unknown gunmen attacked the university community on Monday and attempted to abduct some students residing off the school campus. However, their operation was foiled by the joint intervention from the officers of Operation Safe Haven, Operation Rainbow, Nigeria Police, University Security and Community Watch Group. Dr Bentse Pamson, ASUU Chairman in the university, speaking to NAN condemned the attack. He called for more security around the institution even as he expressed concern over the threat to the lives of students. “This issue of insecurity in the institution is what we agitated for in our Memorandum of Action with the state government about two months ago. “It’s unfortunate that nothing from the MOA signed between ASUU and the government has been implemented,’’ he said. Pamson expressing concern over the threat to the lives and property of members of staff and students of the institution urged the government to take more drastic measures to safeguard the institution.
