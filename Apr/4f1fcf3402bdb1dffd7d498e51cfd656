Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, has admitted he hopes to manage the club in future after he retires. Fernandes moved to Old Trafford in January 2020 from Sporting Lisbon. The Portugal midfielder has gone on to become a key member of the first-team squad. And while he has his best years ahead of him at the age of 26, he is already thinking of what to do after he hangs his boots. Speaking to the club’s official website after being asked which club he would like to manage, he said: “I’m trying to enjoy the football, you know. I think I want to be a coach. Honestly, I would like to be a coach. “I don’t know which team I would like to manage. Of course, the biggest team if I can manage Manchester United, I will be happy. I can leave now just some words so if people see this if I’m a manager in the future, the fans can make some pressure to bring me as a coach!”
