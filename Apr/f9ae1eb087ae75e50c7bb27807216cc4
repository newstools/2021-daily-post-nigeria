The All Progressives Congress (APC) has extended its ongoing nationwide membership registration and revalidation exercise by three weeks. Sen. John Akpanudoedehe, National Secretary of the party’s Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), announced the extension in a statement on Thursday in Abuja, NAN reports. He said the CECPC under the leadership of Gov. Mai Mala Buni had done everything possible to keep to the earlier timeline for the exercise but could not. Akpanudoedehe said it became important to extend the duration of the exercise by three weeks to enable more Nigerians who were interested in joining the APC to do so. He added that from the audit reports received from the party’s state registration committees and its situation rooms most states started the exercise late and require additional time to conclude the exercise. He further added that the CECPC had received several applications from critical stakeholders of the APC including its states’ caretaker Chairmen for an extension of exercise. “Consequently, the CECPC has approved the recommendation of the national committee for the membership registration, revalidation and update to extend the duration of the exercise for three weeks,” he said. Recall that the party had earlier on Feb. 22, extended its ongoing nationwide membership registration and revalidation exercise. The exercise formally began on Feb. 9 across the 36 states of the federation to March 31.
