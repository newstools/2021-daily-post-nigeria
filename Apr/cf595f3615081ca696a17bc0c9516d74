The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) says the Buhari administration’s appointment of Rectors for six new polytechnics violates the Federal Polytechnics (Amendment) Act, 2019. Anderson Ezeibe, ASUP President in a statement on Sunday stressed that the appointees had no experience. Last week, the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, named principal officers for the new institutions to include, Federal Polytechnic, Ayede, Oyo: Prof. Dakas J. Dakas is Council Chairman; Dr Taofeek Adekunle – Rector; Federal Polytechnic, Ohodo, Enugu: Chief Sylvester Ameh is Council Chairman; Prof. Edwin Onyeneje – Rector; Federal Polytechnic, Ugep, Cross River: Prof. Andrew Chukumeri is Council Chairman; Prof. Edward Ntui-Okay – Rector. Federal Polytechnic, Shendam, Plateau: Sixtus Abetianbe is Council Chairman; Dr. Zakari Ya’u – Rector; Federal Polytechnic, Monguno, Borno: Dr. Umar Tambari is Council Chairman; Prof. Garba Mohammed – Rector; Federal Polytechnic, Wannune, Benue: Ibrahim Tukur is Council Chairman, Engineer Dr. Terlumun Utser – Rector. However, Ezeibe claimed that five out of the six new Rectors “are not qualified for the positions”. The union leader said their engagement fell short of the requirements captured in Section 8, 2 (a)i of the Federal Polytechnics Act. ASUP regrettable that the federal government became “principal violators” of the governing laws and recent ruling of the National Industrial Court. The lecturers added that the appointment undermined the essence of the union’s current engagement with the government. Ezeibe told Nigerians to hold the government responsible for any escalation of its current industrial action. ”We are therefore demanding the withdrawal of these appointments to usher in a process of appointment in alignment with the provisions of the law”, the statement concluded.
