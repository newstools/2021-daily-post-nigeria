Ayodele Fayose, former Governor of Ekiti State has described the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde as “deadly.” Fayose stressed that Makinde looks quiet but was very deadly. He was reacting to a video where the Oyo State Chairman of National Union of Road Transport Workers, NURTW, Alhaji Lamidi Mukaila aka Auxiliary threatened to kill him. The incident happened during the just concluded zonal Congress of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Osogbo, the Osun State capital. In the video, ‘Auxiliary’ could be heard saying “We are waiting for Fayose here, Ogun will kill you.” However, Fayose linked Auxillary and his boys to Makinde because they allegedly accompanied the governor to the venue of the congress. Appearing on Politics Today on Channels Television, the former Ekiti State governor lamented that such a situation was bad for the PDP. Fayose said: “If governor Makinde, a first-term two-year-old governor is parading characters like this it simply shows the kind of people behind him. “This is shameful for our party and I take responsibility. In the 21 century, thuggery is shameful for our party. “Remember, I was in Ondo and this same person attacked me and I told Governor Makinde, so I am glad the whole world is seeing this. “Governor Makinde looks quiet but deadly.”
