Michael Owen, a former Real Madrid and Manchester United forward, has predicted Arsenal to beat Everton when both teams clash in the Premier League on Friday night at Emirates Stadium. Arsenal head to the game following a 1-1 draw with Fulham last Sunday, while Everton played a 2-2 draw with Tottenham. Providing his prediction, Owen told BetVictor, “In their last four matches at the Emirates, Arsenal have drawn two and lost two. It’s been that kind of season for the Gunners as they continue to struggle to find any consistency. “That said, they have an impressive record on their own patch against Everton. Undefeated in this fixture on home soil since 1996, this has the look of a winnable match against their Merseyside rivals. “On top of that, Everton arrives here in a rather indifferent form. The Toffees are without a win in six and although it could be argued they were worth more than a point last week against the Spurs, their defensive display really let them down. “With neither side at their best in recent weeks, I believe this will be tight, however, Everton looks really shaky at the back just now, so I’m going for a home win. Arsenal 2, Everton 1.” The kick-off time for Arsenal vs Everton is 8 pm.
