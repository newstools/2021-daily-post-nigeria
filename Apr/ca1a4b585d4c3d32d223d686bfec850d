Real Madrid defender, Raphael Varane, wants a move to Manchester United this summer’s transfer window. Varane has drawn the interest of Man United, PSG and Chelsea in the past. The 27-year-old has just one year remaining on his contract with Real Madrid at the end of the season and is yet to agree to a new deal with the Los Blancos. It means Real Madrid is willing to listen to offers for the centre-back this summer, with Man United, PSG and Chelsea vying for his signature. However, according to AS, Varane has the preference to join Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side despite the interest from several other clubs. The report added that Varane is still weighing his options and has not ruled out the possibility of a move away from Real Madrid at the end of the season. PSG have stepped up their interest in Varane in recent months but the Brazilian international is understood to be prioritising a move to the English Premier League if he does leave the LaLiga champions. Meanwhile, speaking about Varane’s future recently, Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez, opened the door to potential suitors to sign the France international. Perez said, “Varane? I am happy with our team if players don’t want to stay at Madrid, they can leave.” Real Madrid is expected to demand over £60m asking price for Varane.
