The Police in Ogun State said it had arrested “a 36-year-old Islamic cleric, Amodu Jamiu, for abducting a 15-year-old girl and attempting to use her for ritual.” DAILY POST learnt that the suspect was arrested on April 5 following a report lodged at Sango divisional headquarters by the victim. The police spokesman in Ogun, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said on Friday that the victim told the police that, “while she was coming from her working place at about 5:30 pm, she was accosted by the suspect, who lured her into an uncompleted building after touching her with an object.” Oyeyemi quoted the teenager as saying that, “on getting to the building, the suspect stripped her naked and used a white handkerchief to rub her private part and all her body.” He said a good Samaritan, who, unknown to the suspect, was watching the whole incident, came to the rescue of the girl after she had become unconscious. Upon the report, the DPO of Sango Division, CSP Godwin Idehai, had detailed his detectives to go after the suspect, who Oyeyemi said was subsequently traced and apprehended by the police. “On interrogation, the suspect confessed that he had the intention of afflicting the victim with a sickness, which will enable him to extort her parents of huge amounts of money, having successfully done it to two different persons in the past.” It was gathered that a search warrant was executed in his house, and “a lot of dangerous criminal charms were recovered from there.” Meanwhile, the state Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, has ordered the transfer of the case to state CIID for further investigation and possible prosecution.
