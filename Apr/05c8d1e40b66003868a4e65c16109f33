Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has admitted that he and every single player are to blame for their 5-2 defeat to West Brom on Saturday. The result brought to an end Tuchel’s winning start as the Blues boss. Christian Pulisic opened scoring for Chelsea before Thiago Silva picked up two yellow cards within the opening 30 minutes. Matheus Pereira’s brace turned the game on its head before Callum Robinson made it 4-1. Although Mason Mount pulled one back, Robinson added another deep into stoppage time to seal a shock result. “It is two games, 11 v 11 and then 11 v 10. There is no need to concede five goals when you have our quality, that’s for sure but we are all in on that. Myself included. “We could not adapt to the situation which is a surprise as we were leading. We are normally confident enough to defend but we were sloppy and kept making big mistakes. We were punished hard and it’s tough to digest. “I didn’t see the red card, I saw the two big mistakes in our own half before the yellow cards. That is not typical for us, we were rusty. We made easy mistakes and were punished. It was totally our fault. “I did not see that second half coming. We tried to give a bit of security with a back three but we were never in a flow. We had some chances but we didn’t defend well,” Tuchel told BBC Sports.
