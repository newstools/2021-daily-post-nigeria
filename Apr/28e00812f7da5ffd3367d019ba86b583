Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the Kwara State People’s Democratic Party, PDP, has moved to woo aggrieved members of the party who defected to other political parties in the state. Chairman of the reconciliation committee of the party in the state, Abubakar Kawu Baraje, disclosed this at a news conference in Ilorin, on Thursday, shortly after the inaugural meeting of the reconciliation committee. Baraje, said, ” No efforts would be spared in bringing back the old members of the party who dumped the party and defected to other political parties.” He said the committee, will extend its assignment to the nooks and crannies of the state to meet with stakeholders and aggrieved members, towards reconciling and bringing them back to the fold. Baraje assured that the grievances of those who dumped the party for other parties and those who are still in the party’s fold would be addressed genuinely and holistically. “We have also resolved that those who have openly expressed their grievances will form those that we will be meeting first. “There are many stakeholders who deserve to be consulted. We will go to such people. We will not wait to invite them, we will give them the respect they deserve by visiting them,” he added. Baraje appealed to sympathizers of the party to support the committee in the efforts to bring back good governance to the good people of the state come 2023.
