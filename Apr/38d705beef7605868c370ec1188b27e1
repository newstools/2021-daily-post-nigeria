Nigeria’s power sector pensioners have urged President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in the N35 billion arrears owed them. Benjamin Amako, President of Electricity Sector Retiree Welfare Association (ESREWA) addressed the media after a National Executive Council (NEC) meeting on Friday in Abuja. Amako recalled that the President ordered payment of their pensions years ago but regretted that government officials were yet to comply. “We have not been paid a dime even as I speak, for reasons that are totally and obviously human making”, NAN quoted him as saying “Over five years since the President’s directive, the relevant authorities whose responsibility it is to ensure we get the arrears for our dying members, seem to be working contrarily.” Amako said the arrears have always been part of the nation’s budget under the Nigeria Electricity Liability Management Company (NELMCO) budget, transferred to the Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD). The union appealed to Buhari, Minister of Finance, Chairman, Senate Committee on Power, Accountant General of the Federation, PTAD and others to save members’ lives. Amako demanded immediate action, noting that the economic situation of the country was taking a toll on pensioners.
