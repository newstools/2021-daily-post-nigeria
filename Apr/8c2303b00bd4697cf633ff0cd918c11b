The family of DMX have denied reports claiming Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z bought the late rapper’s master recordings for $10 million. Recall that the hip-hop icon, whose real name is Earl Simmons, was hospitalized after he suffered a drug overdose that triggered a heart attack on April 2. Unfortunately, he passed on Friday after suffering a cardiac arrest at the age of 50. However, rumours had emerged after his death that Beyoncé and Jay-Z had purchased his master recordings for $10 million. Reacting, his family in a statement released on Tuesday refuted the claims. The statement further warned the public to be vigilant and not to get scammed by people trying to raise money for the hitmaker’s funeral. “There have been a few rumours following our loved one, Earl Simmons’, passing that we’d like to clear up. No one has bought Earl’s masters. Ok dear “If anyone is requesting money for his funeral please be aware the person is a scammer. We will keep the public posted on funeral/memorial service arrangements,” the statement said. Meanwhile, streams of the late music legend’s tunes have skyrocketed by 928 percent since his passing on April 9. A total of 75.7 million audio and video streams were counted on April 9 and 10.
