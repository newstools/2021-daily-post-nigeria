A family of five who were returning to their base in Abuja have been abducted by gunmen suspected to be kidnappers in Ondo State. The victims who were on their way to Abuja after the Easter celebration in their hometown of Ajowa-Akoko in Akoko North West Local Government Area of Ondo State were kidnapped between Ajowa and Ayere in Kogi State. According to a native of Ajowa, Ibrahim Olusa, the victims were a husband, wife and three children. He added that they were abducted at gunpoint while exiting the community to Abuja where they reside. A family source told DAILY POST that the kidnappers have contacted the family, demanding 10 million Naira as ransom before they can be released. Following the development, there have been apprehension and anxiety in the community. A resident of Ajowa Akoko and the immediate past Chairman of Ajowa-Akoko community council, Ajayi Bakare, attributed the kidnappings and robberies within the axis to the deplorable state of the roads. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Tee-Leo Ikoro said he was yet to be briefed on the development.
