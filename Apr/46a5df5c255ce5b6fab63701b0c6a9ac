The Archbishop of Kampala Archdiocese in Uganda, Cyprian Kizito Lwanga has passed away. The cleric was found dead in his home, according to a statement by Fr Pius Male Ssentumbwe. “We pray that the Almighty and Merciful God may grant him eternal rest. Further arrangements will be communicated later,” he wrote. The deceased was last seen in public on April 2, 2021 during mass at Rubaga Catholic church where he led the homily of Good Friday celebrations. In December 2020, Lwanga made headlines for calling for postponement of January 2021 elections for three years to contain the spread of coronavirus. “We are asking Parliament to sit down and amend the Constitution to allow President Museveni to continue ruling and guiding the country during the period of three-year postponement of elections,” he said. The comment sparked local and international rebuke; critics and the opposition accused him of siding with members of the ruling government. Born in January 1953, the late clergyman was ordained a priest on April 8, 1978. Lwanga was installed as the third Archbishop of Kampala on September 30, 2006 at Rubaga Cathedral. He succeeded Cardinal Emmanuel Wamala.
