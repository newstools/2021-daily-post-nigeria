Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has responded to the verbal attack on him by Tottenham manager, Jose Mourinho. The Norwegian explained his true feelings after the Portuguese’s outburst following Red Devils’ 3-1 win over Spurs on Sunday. Son Heung-min put Spurs ahead in the first half but United came back stronger in the second half, scoring three goals through Fred Rodriguez, Edinson Cavani and Mason Greenwood. However, the climax of the game was the incident involving Son Heung-min which forced the match officials to disallow Cavani’s first-half goal. After the game, Solskjaer had criticised Son Heung-min for lying on the pitch surrounded by Tottenham players, saying that he would not feed his son if he (his child) acted the same away the Korean international did. And Solskjaer’s comment angered Mourinho, who in turn, said that Solskjaer might not have been a good father to his son, adding that a good parent will feed his son no matter what. “If that’s me telling that player A, B or C from another club, it was my son I wouldn’t give him dinner or something like that, what would be the reaction?” Mourinho said. “Sonny [Son Heung-min] is very lucky his father is a better person than Ole…” And responding, Solskjaer insisted he and Mourinho are friends despite their tense exchange. “I think sometimes some words are being said, sometimes you feel sorry for – the most important thing is that we’re good colleagues and – call it friends, before, after and sometimes during a game you can have a little bit of a dispute and I think we’ve got the utmost respect for each other and I think that’s the point here,” he told MUTV. “Sometimes it’s some words being said that you don’t really [mean] – I had a couple of words I can take back at that time.”
