James Oche, the Chairman of Ado Local Government Area of Benue State, has said that the people of Agila have no hand in the Monday morning attack on Umuogudu Akpu-Ngbo community in Ohaukwu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. DAILY POST had reported that attackers started shooting sporadically in the community, killing at least four persons. Oche also described as a fallacy of hasty conclusion, the reports in the media credited to the Ebonyi State Government alleging that the people of Agila are behind the attack. The Chairman, in a statement, said the victims themselves had said the attack was from herders and wondered why the Ebonyi State Government was bent on accusing his people even in the face of rumours making the rounds that the attack was a reprisal for the alleged killing of their cows. Oche who spoke in Igumale, the Headquarters of Ado Local Government yesterday, said he was disappointed by the report. According to him, the people of Agila are peace-loving and have since embraced the recommendations of the Otse Otokpa/Cyril Obazi Agila/Ngbo Intercommunity Peace and Security Committee formed by the governments of Ebonyi and Benue States. He also noted that falsehood wasnâ€™t the solution to the problem as it would worsen the already volatile situation. Oche urged the warring factions to sheath their swords and fully embrace the ongoing inter-community peace initiative of Benue and Ebonyi States Governments in the interest of security, peace, and development of the region. He, however, sympathized with the victims of the unfortunate attack and prayed to almighty God to comfort them in these very trying times.
