All of MRCC’s medical professionals have completed advanced training on the machines. Commenting on the facility, Dr. Modupe-Odunsi said: “We built the Marcelle Ruth Cancer Centre & Specialist Hospital to help address the gap in the treatment and diagnosis of cancer in Nigeria. Patients who previously would have had to travel abroad to receive world-class treatment are now able to get the critical care they need here at home. Early detection is vital to the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.” The Marcelle Ruth Cancer Centre & Specialist hospital has finalized partnerships with the leading healthcare insurance providers in Nigeria including BUPA, Allianz, AXA Mansard, AETNA, CIGNA and UnitedHealth Group.  Bolaji Odunsi, Co-Founder, commented: “We are delighted to see our vision of the MRCC finally come to life. Our mission was simple: bring together an exceptional team of Nigerian medical professionals with international training and experience to deliver the highest quality care to patients here in Nigeria. This expertise supported by new technology now makes world-class treatment here in Nigeria possible and affordable.” Eyong Ebai, General Manager of GE Healthcare in Sub-Saharan Africa, said: “We are proud to continue supporting the development of Nigeria’s healthcare infrastructure. Our partnership with the Marcelle Ruth Cancer Centre & Specialist Hospital is a true landmark as it underlines the role that the private sector can play in delivering world-class healthcare delivery in the country. These new solutions are designed to expand capacity and improve quality for diagnosis and treatment at MRCC and help meet the needs of community within the country and region.” According to a study by the World Health Organization (WHO), it is possible to prevent a third of cancer cases and treat many other cases with early diagnosis and treatment. The latest statistics reveal that cancer accounts for 18.2% of premature deaths attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and in 2018, of the 115,950 cancer cases reported, 70,327 patients did not survive.  GE Healthcare is a long-term partner in building Nigeria’s healthcare infrastructure, and continues to provide external expertise in hospital design, hospital planning and training. More than 5,800 GE Healthcare technologies are deployed in hospitals and clinics across the country. The hospital opened to provide world-class, “one-stop” services for the comprehensive treatment of cancer and other specialist conditions. At the purpose-built premises on Victoria Island, Lagos, the team offers the highest standards of care with the latest treatments and technology, in comfortable surroundings designed to promote healing. The hospital is named in honour of the Co-founders mother/mother-in-law, Mrs Marcelle Ruth Odunsi (1931-1998), previously Vice-Principal, Igbobi College, Lagos and Founding Principal, Government College, Agege.
