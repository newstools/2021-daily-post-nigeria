The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has seized consignments of heroin and khat worth N10 billion in street value. The spokesman, Femi Babafemi, in a statement, said the seizures were made at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos, and the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA), Kano. During cargo examination at Skyway Aviation Handling Company Plc (SAHCO) Import Shed, at the MMIA, a freight agent had presented a cargo from South Africa. It was with an Ethiopian Airline flight ET 3901 and an Airway Bill no: 071-40689003, for examination by NDLEA operatives. A suspected brownish substance was discovered concealed inside a red ‘Ghana-must-go’ bag. The suspect said another freight agent sub-contracted the clearing job to him. Six suspects have so far been arrested in follow up operations, while the substance had tested positive for heroin, with a total weight of 24.05kg. “Another consignment in the consolidated cargo also proved to be methamphetamine with a weight of 1.25kg”, NDLEA said. Kano operatives intercepted and seized a consignment at its cargo shed, meant for export to Manchester, United Kingdom. The suspected substance in the consignment was sent for laboratory analysis and the result came out positive for Khat, weighing 36kg. “This brings the total weight of illicit drugs seized at the two international airports to 61.3kg, ” he said.
