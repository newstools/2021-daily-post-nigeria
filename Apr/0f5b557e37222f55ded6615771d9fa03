Unidentified hoodlums have set the Imo State correctional centre on fire, freeing hundreds of inmates. DAILY POST gathered that the hoodlums took advantage of the calm atmosphere of Easter to invade the centre at the wee hours of Monday. This development came after the state Commissioner of Police, Nasiru Mohammed said that he had deployed over 4760 personnel to ensure maximum security during and after the Easter celebration. Our correspondent gathered that there was sporadic shooting on Monday morning which lasted for three hours before the centre was bombed. Owerri residents and commuters who ply the Okigwe road are apprehensive as the situation is degenerating. Efforts to reach the Police Public Relations officer, Orlando Ikeokwu proved abortive as his phone was unavailable at press time. Submit
