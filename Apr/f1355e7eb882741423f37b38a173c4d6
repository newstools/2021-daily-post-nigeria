Managerial legend, Sir Alex Ferguson, was left angry with the way Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was thrown in front of the cameras and left blindsided on the club’s involvement in the European Super League. The European Super League plans were leaked shortly before United tackled Burnley in the Premier League on Sunday, and caused potential disruption to Red Devils’ preparations. The Athletic reports that, “Ferguson was understood to be unhappy by the way the club’s current manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, had been left to fend questions from broadcasters and journalists.” The club’s Spanish duo, Juan Mata and David de Gea were said to have also spoken out the way the situation was handled. The European Super League proposal collapsed mainly due to the lack of proper consultation with supporters. Owners of the 12 big clubs went behind everybody’s backs and tried to force their idea on everyone else.
