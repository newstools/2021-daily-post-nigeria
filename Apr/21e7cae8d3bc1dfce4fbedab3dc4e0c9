The leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has said the decision for citizens to remain or quit a nation is determined by the “popular will of the people”. The IPOB leader in a tweet on his official handle on Friday evening, said the slogan, ‘one Nigeria’, is an empty one. He described the 1914 amalgamation of the Northern and Southern protectorate by Lord Lugard and his wife, Flora Shaw as a business decision that can not determine one’s move to stay in Nigeria. “#OneNigeria can neither be based on a business decision made by a Lugard, a Flora or any other foreigner, nor by the force of a tribalized @HQNigerianArmy or by the empty slogan that Nigeria is one. “The decision to stay in one nation is a matter of the popular will of the people”, Kanu tweeted. Meanwhile, while reacting to an alleged comment by the Zamfara State Governor, Bello Muhammad Matawalle that “Southerners should not expect protection if the killing of Northerners continues in the South”, Kanu said the comment could trigger action for urgent disintegration of Nigeria. “The only way the South can respond to this sort of potent THREAT is to make Nigeria’s DISSOLUTION more urgent”, Kanu added.
