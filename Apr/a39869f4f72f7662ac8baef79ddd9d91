Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has insisted it is the referee’s prerogative to award penalties or not. Zidane was reacting to comments by Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman. Koeman feels Barca should have gotten a spot kick, after Ferland Mendy appeared to pull down Martin Braithwaite in the dying minutes of the game. However, referee Gil Manzano waved play on and VAR did not intervene in the decision. When asked about Koeman’s comments, Zidane said: “They’re the feelings of each person. “The referee did not give a penalty because it wasn’t a penalty. As for the time added on, he is the one that decides. The important thing for us is what we did on the pitch. “We had a lot of chances to score. Barcelona are a really good team, they were ahead of us before the game, we can be happy. We can’t say it was only the referee, it was our victory on the pitch.”
