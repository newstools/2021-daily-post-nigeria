Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba, has said he was glad to see the collapse of the proposed European Super League. Drogba said the breakaway competition threatened the core values of football and discriminated against smaller teams. Recall that twelve of Europe’s big clubs – the Premier League’s so-called ‘big six’, plus Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus, Atletico Madrid, AC Milan, and Inter Milan had on Sunday night unveiled their plans to start the controversial project which offered immunity from relegation for founding members. But two days later, Chelsea and Manchester City were the first teams to be pulled out from the European Super League following widespread condemnation from fans, politicians and pundits. However, reacting to the development, Drogba, in a tweet via his handle on Wednesday night, said, “Promotion, relegation, unexpected results is what drives the emotions of the game, Being together, as players, as fans… that’s what makes it the beautiful game. “Little” @EthnikiOmad beating the “big” @selecaoportugal a few years ago, @kkcrvenazvezda beating my team @OM_Officiel. “Or even @LCFC working hard to win the @premierleague title in front of the “big four” is what makes football the beautiful game. Imagine all this effort and not being allowed to compete against other teams because you’re not one of them despite playing the same game. “Is a kind of discrimination. I’m glad this project is not happening for the sake of the beautiful game and our amazing fans all around the world.”
