Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said his team is closing the gap on Manchester City and their “benchmark” coach Pep Guardiola. The Blues beat City 1-0 in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. The victory for the Blues, which is Tuchel’s first over Guardiola, contrasted with a 3-1 loss at home by City in early January, which eventually led to the departure of Frank Lampard. “If you play against Pep, you know that you play against the highest level in Europe. “Everywhere he was on the sidelines, with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and now Manchester City, he was the benchmark for years with his teams and he is again. “Our target is to close the gap for the 90 minutes, because it is possible in football and if you arrive in a good momentum, you can make this happen,” Tuchel said.
