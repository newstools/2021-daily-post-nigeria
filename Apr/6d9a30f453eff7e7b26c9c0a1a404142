The Federal Government of Nigeria has warned citizens against travelling to countries that are recording a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The countries that are currently recording a third wave of the pandemic are India, Brazil, South Africa and Turkey. The National Incident Manager (NIM) of the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19, Dr. Mukhtar Muhammad, disclosed this at the media briefing by the committee on Monday. Muhammad also warned Nigerians against shunning safety protocols against COVID-19, insisting that the virus was not over. He said, “While we continue to reopen the economy, we must also be aware of the happenings around the globe. Mr Chairman (Boss Mustapha) and the Honourable Minister of Health (Osagie Ehanire) have made reference to specific incidents in India, Turkey, Brazil and South Africa. “We sympathise with the people of these countries [India, Brazil, South Africa and Turkey] because it is really a very trying time, particularly for India that is recording over 300,000 cases a day and recording over 2,000 deaths. “India is a prime destination for medical tourism for Nigeria. We know that many Nigerians like to travel – to go to India but now… we urge Nigerians to limit all travels to only essential travels, particularly to these affected countries.”
