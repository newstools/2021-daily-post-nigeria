Former Liverpool midfielder, Jamie Redknapp, has labelled Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, as the greatest manager ever. Redknapp hailed Guardiola as a “genius” after a 1-0 win over Tottenham in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final. Aymeric Laporte headed in the winning ball in the 82nd minute. The victory saw Guardiola lift the trophy for the fourth year in a row. “But they are a joy to watch, if you enjoy watching football then you love watching Manchester city play. The way they move it, the triangles, it is a joy to watch. Pep Guardiola, I think he is a genius, the players will run through brick walls for him. The football they play in midfield, from the back, its a joy and they were far superior. “Is he the greatest ever? I personally think with the style of football he plays, how humble he is, the way he improves players, I think he is the greatest ever. Already for whatever happens from here. “There was always that argument when he was at Barcelona that he had Messi, Iniesta, Xavi. But now everywhere he goes you see the progression, the improvement. And this year might be the most successful,” Redknapp told Sky Sports.
