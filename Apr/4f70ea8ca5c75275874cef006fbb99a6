Plans by the US government under President Joe Biden, to discourage abortion across the globe, may have begun to yield results as non-US NGOs will no longer have access to grants except they certify that they do not engage in abortion-related activities. The Director, Policy and Advocacy at the Population Action International (PAI), Jonathan Rucks, who at a webinar session organized for media practitioners by Ipas-Nigeria, made the above disclosure. Rucks said the decision is contained in the Global Gag Rule already accented to by President Biden. Passionate about the move to key into the global gag rule “foreign NGOs, he said cannot receive any form of U.S global health assistance unless they sign a certification that they will not engage in abortion-related activities. ” Rucks who expressed the readiness of the US to work tirelessly round the clock to end the practice said “NGOs that decide to sign the certification are banned from providing abortion services, counselling and referral for abortion services. ” Advocating to increase access to safe legal abortions, he said would no longer be condoned under the global gag rule, hence the need for foreign NGOs seeking to access global health assistance, to as a matter of urgency, distance themselves from abortion-related services. Rucks also urged U.S NGOs to thread extra legitimate miles to intimate their partners on the new development, stating that the “U.S NGO must enforce the eligibility requirements of the global gag rule on their foreign NGO partners. ” According to him “Any foreign NGOs that receives any sub-grant or sub-contract from a US NGO that is paid for with US global health assistance must also sign the global gag certification. ” Areas that would continue to receive funding assistance from U.S Non-Governmental organisation under the global gag rule includes according to Rucks are Maternal and Child Health, family planning and reproductive health, nutrition, HIV/AIDS, malaria, Tuberculosis among others.
