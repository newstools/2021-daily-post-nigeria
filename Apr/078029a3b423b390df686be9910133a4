Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has confirmed his team news for their Carabao Cup final clash with Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday evening. Guardiola said that Sergio Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne are both in contention to return for Man City’s Carabao Cup final against Tottenham at Wembley Stadium after both players trained ahead of the game. According to him, he will wait until after the final training session on Saturday to make a decision on whether Aguero will have the chance to feature for Man City against Tottenham. Injury has prevented Aguero from being involved in Man City’s previous four matches, while De Bruyne missed the midweek win over Aston Villa after he picked up a knock on his right foot and ankle in the FA Cup semi-final defeat to Chelsea last week. “Both [Aguero and De Bruyne] trained today,” Guardiola said at Friday’s pre-match press conference. On Aguero, Guardiola added: “Today was his first training session in two weeks. Tomorrow is the last session, and we will then decide.” The kick-off time for Man City vs Tottenham match is 4.30 pm.
