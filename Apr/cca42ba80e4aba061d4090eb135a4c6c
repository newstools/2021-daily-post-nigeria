The Ogun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the government of Governor Dapo Abiodun and the All Progressives Congress (APC) represented unlimited agony in the state. This was contained in a statement made available to DAILY POST by the State Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Akinloye Bankole, on Saturday. Bankole, who said the Ogun APC was pained with the growing wave of stability and harmony in the PDP in recent time, told the party that Ogun people are still awaiting all the “electoral eldorado” it promised during the campaigns. According to Bankole, Ogun government under Abiodun “should remember that while the Governor chooses to keep silent, the scourge of insecurity in Ogun state still looms large under his weakling watch.” The PDP maintained that “displaced Ogun indigenes who are in asylum in Benin Republic are tired of grains and noodles,” adding that “they want to return to a secured home.” The government was also reminded that about “15 months of Ogun workers deductions and leave bonuses are still being owed.” The PDP spokesman challenged Gov Abiodun to make available to the public, the content of the 2021 budget, stressing that Ogun people deserve to know the full details of all contracts cost, duration and other engagement terms. He said, “We can not fold our arms while the business of democratic governance is shrouded in blatant secrecy.” “On the strength of our robust partnership with the good people of Ogun state, who are extremely exhausted by the unlimited agony which the ruling APC government represents, our party, the PDP, is committed to providing an alternative governance with human face come 2023,” the statement read in part.
