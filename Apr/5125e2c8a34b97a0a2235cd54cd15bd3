The Wife of Ekiti State Governor, Erelu Bisi Fayemi has restated the state government’s zero tolerance for Gender-Based Violence among students. She also canvassed speedy dispensation of justice on Gender-Based Violence as a way of reducing the spate of occurrence in the state. Erelu Fayemi stated this on Tuesday during an advocacy visit by the Ekiti State Gender-Based Violence Management Committee to the School of Nursing and Midwifery, Ado Ekiti. According to Erelu Fayemi, who is Chair of the GBV Management Committee, delay in the dispensation of justice and absence of sanctions for violent sexual assaults would continue to fuel the culture of impunity of the heinous crime if not addressed. The Governor’s wife said it was regrettable that women who are victims of violent sexual crimes are often afraid to report to appropriate authorities for fear of stigmatization, blame and rejection. She called for a concerted effort to nip the menace in the bud because of its capacity to destroy lives, erode self-esteem, bring educational opportunities to a halt and increase sexually transmitted diseases. The Chief Medical Director, Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital (EKSUTH), Professor Kayode Olabanji; urged the nursing students to see themselves as ambassadors against Gender-Based Violence and start propagating the dangers inherent in it to curb the menace. In her remarks, the School of Midwifery’s Acting Principal, Mrs Olabisi Awe reassured the committee that the institution would immediately put in place processes towards zero tolerance for Gender-Based Violence. She promised the immediate inauguration of a Gender-Based Violence club among the students for reporting suspicious cases.
