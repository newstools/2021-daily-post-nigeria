Heavy rainstorm, accompanied by windstorm, wreaked havoc in Zango-Kulende quarters of Ilorin, Kwara State capital on Thursday evening. The rainstorm which lasted less than one hour, blew off most buildingsâ€™ rooftops. It also brought about the collapse of most buildings in the community. Electric poles were not spared thereby disrupting power supply to most parts of the community. DAILY POST reports that the less than one hour rainstorm, which occurred between 4.30 and 5.30p.m was the first of its kind in the history of the community.

Two newly completed buildings, including a three-bedroom flat, collapsed as a result of the rainstorm. No official reaction of the state government has been received as of the time of filing this report.
