The Leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has released new prophecies on insecurity in Nigeria, and briefly talked about 2023 general elections. The man of God in a statement released by his media office, made it known that he foresees Nigeria going into a state of anarchy with the way insecurity is being handled in the country. He said the service chiefs need to seek divine intervention to solve insecurity problems, and advised that all security parastatals work together to battle insecurity before it finally gets out of hand. ‘’The security state of Nigeria is disturbing, it needs divine intervention, the IGP and service chiefs should wake up, it will become unbearable. “We need to pray for the Villa against mourning as a result of insecurity. This security matter will discredit all service chiefs if care isn’t taken. I foresee this resulting into a state of anarchy before 2023 and it will cause misfortune in 2023. “The politicians should wake up on this because there will be political tension, kidnapping, assassination, we have to be careful. Bomb scare in major cities in Nigeria. “We need to be watchful of gunshots on top personalities, governors’ convoys will be attacked too, no politician will be safe anymore regardless of their security details.’’ He also revealed that the insecurity will begin to spread to some neighbouring countries, while explaining that all the leaders need to work together to avert this. “The neighboring countries like Chad, Togo, Benin Republic, Niger Republic should wake up because there is more challenges from terrorism coming, these leaders should listen and take bold steps before it gets out of hand, I see security calamity that will affect all the states in Nigeria, all security operatives should work together, attacks will be directed at sensitive places.”
