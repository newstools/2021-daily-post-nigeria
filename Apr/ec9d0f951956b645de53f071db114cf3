UEFA have opened an investigation into Zlatan Ibrahimovic over “alleged financial interest in a betting company”. Ibrahimovic recently signed a one-year extension with AC Milan, after scoring 15 times in 17 league matches this season. It means the Big Swede could play into his 40s. However, his career has been plunged into doubt, with news he is facing a UEFA probe, with the governing body appointing an official to investigate a potential breach of their Disciplinary Regulations. An official UEFA statement read: “In accordance with Article 31(4) of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations (DR), a UEFA Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector has today been appointed to conduct a disciplinary investigation regarding a potential violation of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations by Mr. Zlatan Ibrahimovic for having an alleged financial interest in a betting company.” Article 31(4) of the UEFA DR states: “The UEFA Executive Committee, the UEFA President, the UEFA General Secretary and the disciplinary bodies may commission ethics and disciplinary inspectors to conduct investigations, either alone or in cooperation with other UEFA or non-UEFA bodies.”
