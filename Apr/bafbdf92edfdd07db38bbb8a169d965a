Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has explained why he benched Sadio Mane in his side’s Premier League 2-1 win against Aston Villa on Saturday. Klopp said Liverpool’s next week’s Champions League quarter-final second-leg tie against Real Madrid did not influence his decision to drop Mane to the bench against Aston Villa at Anfield. According to him, he made the decision based on performance. Two second-half goals from Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold gave Liverpool all three points against Aston Villa. Asked if the game against Real Madrid played a part in his team selection, Klopp said at his post-match press conference: “No, not it’s pure coincidence that you brought up at that moment. “Well, not you personally, but the media brought up Sadio didn’t score for so many games. “It’s a situation where you have a look at who is performing how and stuff like this, how does it work together? Where can Bobby play and Mo obviously and Diogo? What can they do? “How can we set up our midfield? What is the right level of aggression? But also football-wise we are playing in the right spaces, all these kinds of things that is what you consider when you think about the line-up. “I didn’t have to do it (drop Sadio Mane), but today I did it.”
