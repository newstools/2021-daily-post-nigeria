Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has said President Muhammadu Buhari’s selfishness led to the death of his lat Chief of Staff, CoS, Abba Kyari. Omokri said Buhari’s selfishness stopped him from building hospitals in Nigeria. He insisted that Kyari would have survived if the president had improved Nigeria’s health sector. In a series of tweets, the former presidential aide stressed that building of hospitals would help provide adequate health care for both rich and ordinary Nigerians. He wrote: “If General @MBuhari had built hospitals, his former Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, would not have died. Buhari is so selfish. “Even after that incident, he still did not take measures to improve Nigeria’s health sector, because he can go to London. “Other nations built #COVID19 hospitals in record time @MBuhari built ZERO! If a chief of staff to the President, and an ex Governor could not be treated for #COVID19 in Nigeria, what of ordinary Nigerians? “That is why we want Buhari to build hospitals in Nigeria. #HarassBuhariOutOfLondon.”
