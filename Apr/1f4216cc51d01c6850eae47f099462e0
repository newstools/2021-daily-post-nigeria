Former President Goodluck Jonathan has expressed sadness over the passing of Afenifere spokesman, Yinka Odumakin. In a statement on Saturday, Jonathan described Odumakin as a courageous patriot and rights crusader who contributed so much to the development of the nation. The ex-Nigerian leader called Odumakin a man with rich democratic credentials. He remembered the active roles of the deceased in the years of activism that birthed and stabilised civil rule in Nigeria. Jonathan said he was a great asset for just causes whose considerable contributions to the growth of civil society is not in doubt. “He also acquitted himself as a seasoned journalist and columnist who promoted egalitarianism and social well-being, in his regular essays. “Mr. Odumakin exits this world with rich democratic credentials, having played active roles in the years of activism that birthed and stabilised civil rule in our country. “As a cultural enthusiast, Mr. Odumakin lived his short life as a force to be reckoned with in propagating and protecting the interest of the Yoruba in the larger Nigeria social space. “This is not a time to lose such a strong promoter of the ideals that would progress our nation in the desired direction of a united, just and equitable society.” Jonathan condoled the wife, Dr. Joe Okei-Odumakin, other members of his family, the Afenifere social-cultural association and the entire civil society. He prayed that God will grant the soul of the departed eternal rest and give all that mourn him the fortitude to bear the loss.
