The Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, has called on Nigerian leaders to exercise restraint in their utterances in the current circumstances facing the country. A communique issued at the end of its National Executive Council, meeting by Emmanuel Yawe, National Publicity Secretary, expressed displeasure at the state of affairs in the north. It condemned the activities of insurgents, kidnappers and bandits in the north saying that their activities were killing the peace and progress for which the north was noted for. The forum said the utterances of some actors and leaders inflame regional, ethnic and religious passions out of the current situation in the country. On the kidnap of students of the Federal College of Mechanization, Afaka, Kaduna, the communique alleged that the Kaduna state government has not done much. “The Forum regretted that the kidnapped students had remained in captivity and the Kaduna state government has not done much to get them released. The Forum agreed to take up their plight with the state government and the federal government too.” “We also warn our youths who have suddenly started distributing messages on the social media calling on reprisal attacks on Ibos and their business interests in the north. We the Arewa Consultative Forum stand against all lawless acts of self-help and call on all northern youths to stop such evil plans,” the forum said. The Arewa Consultative Forum said it believes in dialogue and consultation as a way of bringing peace and normalcy back to the troubled region and the country. The forum, however, condemned the payment of ransom and called on the bandits and insurgents who are holding other citizens as hostages to desist from such ungodly acts. It noted that no religion that is practised in Northern Nigeria permits such sinful acts like holding other human beings hostage for financial rewards.
