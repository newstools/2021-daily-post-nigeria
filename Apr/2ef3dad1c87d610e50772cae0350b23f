Leicester City boss, Brendan Rodgers, is not interested in joining Tottenham Hotspur this summer and wants to stay with the Foxes, according to Eurosport. Rodgers, who has previously managed Liverpool and Celtic, is a leading target for Spurs. Tottenham sacked Jose Mourinho last week after only 18 months in charge. Rodgers led Leicester to fifth place last season and only failed to qualify for the Champions League after an end-of-season collapse. The Northern Irishman will likely rectify that this season, with Leicester in third place with five remaining in the Premier League. His brand of football has attracted the attention of Spurs. But with Leicester on course for a Champions League spot and in the final of the FA Cup, Rodgers believes he can take the Foxes to new heights.
