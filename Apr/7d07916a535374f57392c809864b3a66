Youths of Allawa community in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State has threatened to mobilize their displaced and hopeless kinsmen to occupy and take shelter in Government facilities within Minna if Government refuses to draft the Joint Security Force Team to the area. Issuing the threats at a press conference in Minna, the President, Lakpma Youth Assembly, Jibrin Allawa said the withdrawal of military operations following the recent attack and killing of five Nigerian Army and a Civil Defense personnel in the area has led to increasing attacks on the area by bandits. He claimed armed bandits have captured eight out of the ten wards of Allawa and dislodged the people from their homes. He said the displaced are currently taking refuge in the primary school at Pandogari, Rafi Local Government area, since the withdrawal of the Joint Security Force Team in the area. Jibrin Allawa explained that since 2015 when the attacks started, over 120 persons have been killed and over N100m lost to ransom by the people who are predominantly farmers. He called on the authorities to rescind the decision of withdrawing the Joint Task Force from Allawa and Bassa communities and tasked security personnel to take the war to the enclaves of the criminals. “Allawa, Bassa and adjoining communities are now porous and vulnerable. Bandits dictate the norm and call the shots. Our people are stranded and hopeless, as the looming humanitarian crisis will be devastating, considering the number of people scampering for safer grounds.” The president of the Lakpma Youth further appealed to the federal government to establish a reinforcement of the Joint Task Force in Kushaka, Kurebe, Manta, Galkogo and Kwaki. He, however, berated the Niger State government for abandoning them to their faith, saying the entire community have relocated to Padongari in Rafi local government Internal Displaced Persons (IDPs) where people are dying of hunger and without medical attention.
