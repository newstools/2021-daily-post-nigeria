The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) chapter has faulted the decision of Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State to force the Vice Chancellor of the University, Professor Olufisayo Ologunde to step aside. ASUU described the decision as wrong. Our correspondent gathered that Makinde had earlier asked the VC to step aside. But, ASUU while reacting, said that it received the news with shock. The Union in a statement made available to DAILY POST through the ASUU Chairman, Dr Biodun Olaniran and Secretary, Dr Toyin Abegunrin, described the suspension of the VC as a violation of the laws of the university. “That if there is any perceived misdemeanour on the part of any officer appointed by the law in the university, due process according to the law must be followed to address such. “That the union acknowledges the power of the visitor to hire and fire on one part and that such power is premised on the recommendation of the governing council according to the extant laws; “That as at today, the governing council has not been properly constituted in line with the law of the University. “Our Union, therefore, requests that, to maintain industrial harmony on campus and the ongoing restoration of the image of the University, the above resolutions should be considered with the necessary urgency.”
