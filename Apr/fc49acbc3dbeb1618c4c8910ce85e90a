In a statement to mark the Easter festivities, the governor said: “As we Christians celebrate the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ on Calvary and His resurrection, let us use the opportunity to reflect on the purpose of Easter and the redemption of our nation that will happen with selfless service, love for one another, forgiveness, empathy and hope.” He noted that it was imperative to pray for national redemption in the spirit of the Easter season, stressing the need for Christians to forge lasting relations with other Nigerians.
