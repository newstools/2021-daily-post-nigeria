The palace of the traditional ruler of Ifitedunu in Dunukofia local government area of Anambra State, Dr Emeka Ilouno has been razed. DAILY POST gathered that the palace of the monarch was invaded by 7pm on Sunday by unknown persons, who set it ablaze, including vehicles in the compound, before leaving. The president-general of the community, Uche Oragwuncha who spoke to our correspondent on phone confirmed the incident but insisted that no one knew who the arsonists are. He said, “It happened on Sunday, at about 7pm. Some people invaded the palace and set it ablaze.” Asked if it could be attributed to unknown gunmen ravaging the southeast zone, Oragwuncha said it is not clear but the community hopes that security agents would fish out the perpetrators, and mete out appropriate sanction on them. He added that a combined team of security men, consisting of police and the military have visited the palace for assessment. When DAILY POST reached out to the spokesperson of Anambra State Police Command, DSP, Toochukwu Ikenga, he said he was not aware of the incident. “I am not aware of that incident, but I will check and get back to you soon,” he said. As at the time of filing this report, Ikenga was yet to confirm the attack on the palace of the monarch.
