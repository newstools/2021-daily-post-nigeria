A car wash operator, Kazeem Olanrewaju, has been nabbed by law enforcement officers after absconding with a Toyota Venza car belonging to one of his customers. DAILY POST reports that Olanrewaju was arrested on Tuesday with the car, registered as APP 775 GB. DAILY POST gathered that the suspect was arrested when the DPO of Idiroko division, CSP Shadrach Oriloye, was on a routine patrol with his men and sighted the Venza car without a number plate, being driven in a suspicious manner. Police Public Relations Officer in Ogun State, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST on Wednesday that the car was flagged down but the driver sped off, instead of stopping for search. “He was hotly chased and apprehended,” Oyeyemi disclosed in a statement. While searching the vehicle, the police had discovered that the number plate was removed and kept inside the vehicle. On interrogation, Olanrewaju was said to have confessed to the police that “he was working with a car wash in Festac Town, Lagos State and he was given the car by a customer to wash while the owner went to a nearby barbing salon to have his hair cut.” Before the arrival of the car owner from the salon, he had run away with the car, having been in possession of the key. “He was on his way to the neighbouring Benin republic with the car when he was caught by the DPO and his men,” the PPRO explained.
