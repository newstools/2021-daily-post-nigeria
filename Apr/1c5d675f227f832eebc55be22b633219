President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the Monday night attack on three communities in Íshíelu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. The President directed law enforcement agencies to fish out the attackers and make them face justice. The affected communities are Egedegede, Obegu and Amuzu communities. The Nigerian leader stressed that the perpetrators of the “heinous attacks” must not be spared. Buhari extended his sympathies to families and friends who have lost loved ones and to the communities. He also sympathized with the former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and a member of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council, Professor Chukwuma Soludo. Soludo, a governorship aspirant in Anambra, was attacked during a town hall meeting in Aguata LGA. Three police escorts were killed. “Our prayers are with him and the families of the security operatives who lost their lives trying to defend innocent citizens assembled for a peaceful meeting.” Buhari reassured Nigerians that ongoing efforts which had led to the record recovery of illegal weapons and arrests of a large number of arms suppliers would be intensified.
