Zamfara State Executive Governor, Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle has refuted a story carried by some media organizations (not DAILY POST) that he declared that he would end banditry in the state within four days. The Governor said he was quoted out of context during a sympathy visit by the All Progressives Governors Forum led by the forum chairman and governor of Kebbi State, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu over the resurgence of banditry attacks in the state where lives of innocent citizens were lost. This was contained in a press statement signed by the Director-General, media and public enlightenment, Government House, Hon. Yusuf Idris Gusau and made available to newsmen in Gusau, the state capital. According to the statement, ”Governor Matawalle told the governors that in the next four days, he will hold a meeting with all stakeholders in the state in order to review his administration’s fight against armed bandits and assured that the outcome of the meeting will bring a new way to end banditry in the state. “There was nowhere in his speech that he mentioned or promised to end banditry within four days as mischievously reported by some conventional media for reasons known to them,” he lamented. “We are appealing to journalists in the state to always clarify their story before going to press.” The statement noted that the Governor also appreciates the support and cooperation he is getting from journalists in the state.
