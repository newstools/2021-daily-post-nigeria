The Nigerian Government on Saturday signed a Memorandum of Action (MoA) with striking National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) to end the ongoing action. The MoA was the second in a fortnight. The first one was signed on March 31, but was later rejected by the striking doctors, NAN reports. Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige, confirmed this on Saturday in Abuja disclosing that the new MoA was signed after a conciliatory meeting between representatives of the Government and those of NARD. Ngige noted that the Saturday’s meeting became necessary to amend the first MoA signed with the striking doctors. “In view of this situation, a five-man committee was set up to harmonise the list of affected officers and they have 72 hours to produce a valid list. “The list will be submitted to the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System through the Federal Ministry of Health,’’ Ngige added. He explained that the health institutions affected by the non-payment of salary shortfalls between 2014 and 2016 and arrears arising from the consequential adjustment on the National Minimum Wage, had been directed to forward their personnel strength. “This is to enable us to accommodate this in the 2021 supplementary budget,’’ the minister said. The minister disclosed that the presidential Committee on Salaries (PCS) would meet with the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission on April 12 to examine the Hazard Allowance issue. The minister added that the NMA, the Joint Health Sector Unions, NARD and other stakeholders would meet on April 14, 2021 with the PCS with their position papers on the issue . Ngige further appealed to NARD to give the conciliation process a chance for industrial peace to prevail by calling off the strike. Responding, NARD President, Dr Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa, promised to present the latest agreement before members with a view to calling off the strike. Recall that doctors began a nationwide strike on April 1.
