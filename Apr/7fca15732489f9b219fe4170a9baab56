Monday Kenneth Eze, a Senior Technical Assistant to Ebonyi Governor, David Umahi has resigned his appointment. His resignation letter was addressed to the Governor through the Secretary to Ebonyi Government. Eze said the exit was “pursuant to the dictates of my conscience and my rights as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution”. He thanked Governor Umahi, former colleagues and the people of Ebonyi for the opportunity to serve the state. Eze, the former SA on Media and Publicity, joined the list of individuals who have dropped their appointment. In November, Egwu Chidiebere, the Special Assistant on Internal Security and Public Utilities (Urban) left. One week earlier, Commissioner for Inter-Governmental Affairs, Lazarus Ogbee stepped down. The development has been linked to reasons, including Umahi’s defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP)
