The Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) has announced that the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) is a basic requirement for admission into the academy. This was made known in a statement by Maj. Bashir Jajira, the NDA Public Relations Officer, on Saturday in Kaduna. He said the academy had nothing to do with fake news speculating that academy suspended UTME for the incoming members of 73 Regular Course. Part of the statement read: “The academy wishes to inform the general public that UTME is one of the basic requirements for entry into the academy. “All interested applicants into the academy must have passed the UTME and attained an acceptable minimum national standard as determined by JAMB annual policy meeting before gaining entry into the 73 Regular Course.” He advised the general public to ignore any information on social media purporting the suspension of JAMB exam for 73 Regular Course.
