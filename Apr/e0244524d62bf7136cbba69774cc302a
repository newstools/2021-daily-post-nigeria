After hiding in the bush for almost 10 days, the Police in Ogun State on Thursday smoked out three members of a kidnap syndicate, who terrorising commuters along the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. The suspects were identified as 24-year-old Nathaniel Jacob, from Nasarawa, 22-year-old Isah Danladi, from Kogi and Abubakar Rabiu, 23 from Niger. Abimbola Oyeyemi, the Ogun State Police Spokesperson, confirmed that the trio was arrested at Fidiwo area, along the highway. Their arrest, according to Oyeyemi, followed a tip-off from some hunters, who had sighted the suspects in the bush where they were reportedly planning an attack on the highway. According to him, the hunters had quickly alerted the police, who rallied other security agencies and stormed the Fidiwo Alapako bush. “On sighting the police, the suspects took to their heels in the bush, but luck ran out of the three and they were subsequently apprehended, while three others escaped with their arms. “On interrogation, the suspects confessed to have been in the bush for the past ten days, waiting for a convenient opportunity to strike. It took them that long because of the heavy presence of policemen on the stretch of the expressway,” the police said. The arrested suspects were said to have informed the police that three other members of the gang had escaped with their firearms “Recovered from them were cutlasses which they claimed were seized from farmers they saw in their farms, Oyeyemi added. Meanwhile, the State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, has directed that the case be transferred to the anti-kidnapping unit at the State CIID for discreet investigation. The CP assured that all the kidnap cases in the state will not go unresolved, saying the command was working assiduously to bring perpetrators to book.
