Former Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, is set to become Crystal Palace coach. According to bookmakers Betfair, Lampard has become the favourite to replace Roy Hodgson at Crystal Palace this summer. The Chelsea legend is ahead of Patrick Vieira, Eddie Howe, John Terry, Sean Dyche, Lee Johnson and Alan Pardew to take over from Hodgson, whose current deal at Selhurst Park will expire at the end of the season. Lampard has been out of a job since he was sacked by Chelsea last January after 18 months in charge of the Stamford Bridge club. The 42-year-old was replaced by Thomas Tuchel, a former PSG and Dortmund coach. Speaking about his intention to return to management, Lampard recently said: “I have had some opportunities that have come up in the last six weeks, two months, that have been flattering but not the right thing. “The opportunities weren’t quite right, but I think about it. It would be something I’m keen to do, at the right time, at the right place.”
