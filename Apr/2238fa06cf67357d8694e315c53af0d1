Suspected armed militia were reported to have killed a soldier in an ambush that occurred in Kofia-Adamu village of Takum Local Government Council of Taraba State. DAILY POST gathered that three other soldiers who sustained gunshot wounds are undergoing medical care in an undisclosed hospital. The attack which occurred at the early hours of today has begun to create tension in the community as residents in their number are relocating to safer areas. Confirming the attack to DAILY POST, the council chairman, Shiban Tikari, who recently escaped the bullets of the militias said the soldiers were ambushed in Kofia-Adamu village along Takum-Wukari road at the “early hours of today. ” Disturbed by the incessant attacks, he stressed on the need for the federal government to come to the aide of the state government in order to effectively checkmate hoodlums’ activities in the council and in the southern part of the state. Suspecting the militias to be of the Tiv extraction, he said, they came from “Tiv villages. ” Residents of the community who bared their minds to DAILY POST confirmed that the attack has continued to ignite tension in the area, stating that, “We have all concluded plans not to sleep here today.” Citing how soldiers were alleged to have launched an attack in the neighboring state of Benue following the killings of some soldiers, he said, “the fear of being attacked has started to force women other people to flee. ” DAILY POST reports that a mobile policeman attached to the 67 Mobile Police Squadron, which is located in the said council was early this week hacked to death by the suspected militias, while trying to protect his principal, who was the chairman of the council from gunshots.
