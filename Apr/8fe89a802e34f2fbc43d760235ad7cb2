Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has hit out at his Manchester United counterpart, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, for claiming that winning silverware is “sometimes an ego thing for managers and clubs”, by insisting the Norwegian’s “big boss” Sir Alex Ferguson would disagree. Solskjaer is on course to lead United to a second place finish in the Premier League this season. It is a feat Mourinho also achieved along with Europa League and EFL Cup success in 2017. Mourinho has often been accused of prioritizing winning trophies over the expense of attractive football or youth development. When asked about Solskjaer’s comments, the Portuguese claimed legendary United boss Ferguson, who won 38 trophies in 26 years, would have disagreed. “It is his opinion. I am pretty sure that his big boss, Sir Alex has a different opinion about it. But I respect what Solskjaer thinks. I think different and [there should be] freedom of thinking, freedom of ideas. “But I believe, I repeat, that his big boss and the biggest of Premier League history has a different view in relation to that,” Mourinho said at a news conference on Friday.
