The Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has said the the killer herdsmen will not escape the anger of God for killing innocent residents of the state. Ortom vowed that the state government would ensure that the killer herdsmen face the wrath of the law for causing havoc in Benue communities. The governor stated this on Saturday when he visited the most populated Internally Displaced Persons IDPs camp, Uikpam in Guma Local Government Area of the state. Ortom, who was accompanied by his wife, Dr Eunice Ortom and other top government officials, lamented the killing of Benue people and destruction of properties in several communities by the Fulan militias. According to Ortom, “Our women including mothers have been raped, homes destroyed, because some people feel that they are above the law. “We in Benue State have a law and those Fulani men that come around and kill, and destroy our home, I want them to know that it doesn’t matter how long it takes, the law will catch up with them. “We are not going to be intimidated by their actions. “They no longer come with their cattle because their original agenda was not even to graze but to kill, destroy our homes and occupy the land. “Now that the law is working very hard, they go about killing our people. One day, the God of Justice will visit them”.
