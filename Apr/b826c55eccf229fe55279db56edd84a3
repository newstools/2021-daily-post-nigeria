Minority Leader of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Mr Danladi Jatau, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP for the All Progressives Congress, APC. Jatau, representing Kokona West constituency, registered with the APC at his polling unit in Uke-Bassa, Kokona Government Area of the State. While calling on his constituents to embrace the ongoing APC membership registration and revalidation exercise, the lawmaker said he joined APC to support the State Governor in developing the state. “I also joined the APC to contribute my quota to the development of the state and to Nigeria at large. “I want to call on the people of my constituency, who are yet to join the ruling APC to do so in their interest and for the overall development of the state,” NAN quoted him as saying.
