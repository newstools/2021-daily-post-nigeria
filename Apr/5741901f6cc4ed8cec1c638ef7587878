Property worth millions of Naira have been destroyed by a storm that sacked residents of Wukari community in Wukari Local Government Area of Taraba State. The incident which occurred Wednesday night as observed by DAILY POST has forced some of the victims to relocate to other communities. A visit to some of the affected areas by our state correspondent reveals a community begging for help in the aftermath of a disaster. One of the victims who gave his name as Majesty Tukura said their utmost need now “is for the government to come out and assist us with roofing sheets in order for us to repair our houses.” Another victim who passionately called on both the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) , to wade in, said the situation has resulted in untold hardship on the affected persons. Some affected persons outside Wukari township who also narrated the untold hardship caused by the storm agreed that the wind did not only remove the roof of their houses but also destroyed their property, which according to them were worth over a hundred million Naira. Pleading with the state government to fashion out ways of coming to their rescue, they said their dreams of ensuring a bumper harvest was at the verge of being crumbled, as part of their farmlands have been destroyed. Visibly dejected, the council chairman, Daniel Adi, called on the relevant authorities to as a matter of urgency come to the rescue of the victims whom he admitted are “now homeless.” Adi , however, said, “I am so happy that no life was lost as a result of the incident that has rendered most of my people homeless.”
