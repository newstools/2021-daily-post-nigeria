He described the process as fair, though it started behind the schedule. “The process so far is going well. Before I was allowed to come in, I had to show them my driver’s license. So, we know quite well that there won’t be ghost voters here today. “Accreditation is starting almost two hours behind schedule. But I really feel like it is better late and thorough than for them to rush through it and we have challenges later. “The message is very simple; this is a zonal congress but it has ramifications for our party at the national level. If we get it right in PDP South West, then, we know that the future will be bright for the party at the national level. “This is not about just coming to elect our zonal officials, we are here to put forward our best and they will, in turn, assist us at the federal level.”
