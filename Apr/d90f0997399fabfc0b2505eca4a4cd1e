Gunmen have again attacked some military personnel in Abua central in Abua Odual Local government Area of Rivers State. DAILY POST gathered that the gunmen killed four of the military personnel and left one with bullet wounds during the attack which was carried out on Sunday night. The military personnel were attached to an oil company in the local government area. A source from the community said, “a female chef was also kidnapped by the hoodlums during the operation”. The source said the incident has resulted in serious panic in the Omenema community, forcing some residents to flee the area.
