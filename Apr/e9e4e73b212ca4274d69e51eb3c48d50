The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has blamed members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Eastern Security Network (ESN) for the attacks in Imo. Adamu has, however, ordered the deployment of additional units of Police Mobile Force (PMF) and other Police Tactical Squads to Imo State to strengthen security. Imo State Police Command Headquarters and the Headquarters of the Nigerian Correctional Services (NCS) in Owerri were bombed on Monday. Force spokesman, Frank Mba, revealed that the attackers used sophisticated weapons such as General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs), Sub-Machine Guns (SMGs), AK49 rifles, Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs), Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). He said the attackers attempt to gain access to the Police armoury at the Headquarters was resisted by Police operatives on duty. Mba confirmed the safe was intact and that the Police suffered no human casualty, apart from a Police Constable who sustained a minor bullet wound on his shoulder. One of the operational vehicles of the attackers has been recovered by the Police and is currently being subjected to forensic scrutiny and investigations. The Imo CP has been ordered to harness the security reinforcement squads and other operational assets at his disposal to take the battle to the doorsteps of the attackers and prevent any further attack anywhere within the state and its environs. The IGP called on citizens to avail the Police and other security agencies with useful information that can assist in identifying and arresting the criminals. He vowed that the perpetrators will be brought to book and assured that the Force is doing all within its powers to curb the activities of unscrupulous elements hell-bent on threatening the unity and safety of Nigerians.
