Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has identified areas his team must improve after beating Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in the Champions League quarter-final first-leg tie on Tuesday night at Etihad. Guardiola, who congratulated his players after securing a vital win over Bundesliga giants, said Man City must improve more on their pressing and build-up in order to qualify for the semi-final. Kelvin de Bruyne opened the scoring for Man City in the first half, but Marco Reus equalized for Dortmund in the second half, but Phil Foden’s late winner gave the Premier League leaders a first-leg advantage ahead of the return leg next week in Germany. “I want to congratulate the players,” Guardiola told the club website after the game. “How they stuck together. The quality of the opponent, not because we were not able to do it, how much we fought and stuck together to the end.” Guardiola added, “Now we fly there at 2-1- always they score, but we will adjust a few things we could not do today. “In a calm way, the best way possible, the game we played and see what we can do better. “We will go there to win the game. I ask the players to win the game. We did it, and now we go to Dortmund not to defend. “We will adjust our pressing, adjust our build-up and play 90 minutes to try and reach the semi-final.” Man City’s next game is against Leeds United in the Premier League this weekend.
