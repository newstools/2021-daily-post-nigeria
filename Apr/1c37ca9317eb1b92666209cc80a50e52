The Osun State Government have asked the residents of Kajola community in Atakunmosa West local government council area of the state to allow peace to reign in their locality by not taking laws into their hands. This request was made by the Commissioners for Water Resources and Energy, Dr. Amidu Tadese Raheem and Lands, Urban Development and Physical Planning, Nathaniel Agunbiade during a reconciliation visit undertaken to disputed lands in the community. The duo frowned at the state of affairs in the community and warned that persons caught or found trying to cause chaos will be made to face the full wrath of the law. They reminded the inhabitants of the state of government’s desire to maintain a peaceful disposition to issues but emphasised that any community member found wanting in that regard will not be spared. While appealing to the feuding parties to sheath their swords, community members were also enjoined to ensure lasting peace in line with the state government’s desire to make Osun the pride and envy of other states in Nigeria. Leaders and members of Kajola community alongside the disputants who were at the peace meeting commended the peace parley masterminded by government representatives, promising not to allow any untoward act that could lead to the breakdown of law and order in the community. DAILY POST gathered that the state government has scheduled another follow-up peace meeting for Tuesday 27th April 2021 at the Conference Hall of the Ministry of Lands, Physical Planning and Urban Development, State Secretariat, Abere, as a demonstration of continuing efforts to resolve the dispute.
