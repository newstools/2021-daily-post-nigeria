The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has said no President will intentionally expose his citizens to banditry and danger. Tinubu stated this while fielding questions from journalists after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The APC national leader, who was accompanied by APC’s pioneer interim National Chairman, Chief Bisi Akande, also debunked speculations that his relationship with Buhari is not good. When asked what the President should do about the insecurity in parts of the country, Tinubu said, “Effective security and effective information. “There is no president who will want his country in chaos. Have you seen one? Point one to me. There is no one that wants his citizens exposed to banditry and danger. “There’s no president or leader that will want his nation fractured by tribalism, religious differences and all that. It calls for serious management and serious evaluation and dialogue once in a while. That’s all.”
