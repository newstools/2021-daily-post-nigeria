Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri has reacted to the return of President Mujmadu Buhari from London where he had a medical check-up. DAILY POST had earlier reported that the president arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe international airport Abuja on Thursday evening. Reacting, the former media aide to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan, who led the #HarassBuhariOutofLondon protest to the Abuja House in London, asked Buhari to focus on establishing medical facilities in the country for all Nigerians. Reno stated this on Thursday in a Facebook post shortly after the President landed in Abuja. The post reads: “Dear General Muhammadu Buhari, welcome back to Abuja, Nigeria. I am sure that after the surprise package we arranged for you in London, you will think twice before returning there. “Now that you know what my people and I are capable of, please focus on building hospitals for yourself and the masses so you will not need to return. Because God sparing my life, I will also return to London to torment you”. Recall that Reno on April 2, led other Nigerians in the United Kingdom to the Abuja House, 2 Campden Hill, Kensington, to demand the president’s repatriation to Nigeria.
