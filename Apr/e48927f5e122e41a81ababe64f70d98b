Seven persons have died while about 5,000 residents are now in hiding following an attack by Boko Haram insurgents on Kwapre, Hong Local Government Area of Adamawa State on Friday. The Adamawa State Emergency Management Agency (ADSEMA) said on Sunday that the displaced were taking refuge mostly in surrounding villages where they fled on the day of the attack. Executive Secretary of the agency, Dr Mohammed Sulaiman, said the insurgents who got into Kwapre in nine vehicles, caused extensive damage to people and properties. The insurgents surrounded the village and killed seven people, including three children, the ADSEMA executive secretary disclosed. “During the attack, 50 houses, worship centres, markets and schools were burnt. Many people, including women, girls and men, were kidnapped by the attackers,” he said. He added, however, that eight abducted residents had escaped to freedom and that normalcy was returning to the otherwise deserted village.
