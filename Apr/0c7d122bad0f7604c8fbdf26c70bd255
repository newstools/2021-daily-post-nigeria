The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has called on the Nigerian Governors Forum, NGF, to urge President Muhammadu Buhari to stop the country from going to war. HURIWA, a frontline activist group, said the state governors should “look at President Muhammadu Buhari eyeball-to-eyeball to demand that he takes concrete and statesmanly steps to stop the country from witnessing imminent war.” The rights group in a statement by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko and National Media Affairs Director, Miss Zainab Yusuf, tasked the governors to stop their individual and corporate beggarly etiquettes and tendencies which they always display whenever they visit the President. HURIWA charged them to conscientiously interface with the president to see to the imperative need to act decisively to arrest the drift before it is very late to rescue the collapsing Nigeria. According to HURIWA: “Every strata of the elites in Nigeria must by now transcend above their jealously guided pettiness and pedestrian political and financial contestations to begin to articulate and implement wholistically, a range of fit-for-purpose and functional mechanisms and measures to stop Nigeria from sliding into the precipice of anarchy, doom and gloom. This may take hard-core legal and constitutional reforms. “We hereby suggest to President Muhammadu Buhari and the governors to resolve to begin a weekly meetings of the National Council of state devoid of frivolities of entertainments and foods, but to intellectually take bold measures to canvass the immediate constitutional reforms to bring into being, effective State Police and to encourage private sector driven security vigilantes to save Nigeria from anarchy. “These measures must be measured, immediate and time barred because the time is ticking fast and the nation is sliding irredeemably into a state of war and it is already in a state of nature whereby life has become cheap, short, brutish and uninteresting even as might has become right in Nigeria even when the Country ought to operate as a Constitutional democracy.”
