Former Real Madrid star, Van der Vaart, has slammed Chelsea star, Timo Werner, describing him as a ‘blind horse.’ According to the former Ajax and Tottenham player, Hakim Ziyech should start ahead of Werner for Chelsea. In a interview with Ziggo Sport, der Vaart was asked whether this was purely because he knew Ziyech from Ajax. The the former Netherlands International said, “No, it’s because he’s the best option. “He is always able to provide for the striker and Giroud needs guys like him. Mount plays in exactly the same way, so that’s why I would pick him too. “Timo Werner is super fast, and maybe that is something good to have in an away game when Chelsea are under pressure, but all he does is put his head down and run, which leads to nothing. ” The Germany International has struggled this season but there are expectations he will come good. Vaart added, “Mount is a terrific footballer, and I think he can get even better as he gains some power, but Werner is truly a blind horse. “He has already showed that’s what he’s like when he played in Germany – and he’s doing it again now.”
