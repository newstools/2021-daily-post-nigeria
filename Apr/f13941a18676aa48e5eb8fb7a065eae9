The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State have cleared all the Chairmanship and Councillorship positions in the just concluded local government Council elections in the State. The Chairman of Rivers State Independent Electoral Commission, RSIEC, retired Justice George Omerejj declared candidates of the PDP winners of the elections out of seventeen political parties that participated in the election. Omereji after declaring the results, advised losers of the elections to accept the result and support the winners to provide good governance at the grassroots, while encouraging the winners to carry everyone along. The RSIEC said that Certificate of returns will be issued to the winners on Monday, just as he commended security agencies for their professional conduct that led to the peaceful electoral process. Earlier, the Social Democratic Party in Rivers State called for outright cancellation of what they described as purported Local Government Council elections. State Chairman of the party, Solsuema Osaro who briefed newsmen in Port Harcourt, said the call follows alleged irregularities and widespread violence in the April 17 local government poll. Osseo alleged that, “there was intimidation of opposition parties’ members, hijack of electoral materials, especially sensitive materials and deployment of PDP members as adhoc staff of the RSIEC”, saying that the process cannot be said to be free and fair under such atmosphere.
