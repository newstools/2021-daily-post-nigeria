Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, has been left “furious” at how the European Super League saga played out as he fears for the damage to his status, according to The Sun. Abramovich had trusted the club’s chairman Bruce Buck’s judgment that joining the European Super League was in Chelsea’s best long-term interest. The Russian billionaire is now angry as he felt “blindsided” by the club’s supporters’ true feelings about the European Super League amid concerns for his legacy and reputation. Recall that Chelsea was one of the top six Premier League clubs to pull away from the European Super League. The Blues fans gathered outside Stamford Bridge to protest against the west London club participation in the European Super League. The decision to back out of the competition had already been made before Chelsea fans gathered at the club’s home ground. Chelsea’s technical advisor, Petr Cech, came out in an attempt to calm fans as they continued to protest. However, Chelsea eventually released a statement on Tuesday night saying: “As reported earlier this evening, Chelsea Football Club can confirm that it has begun the formal procedures for withdrawal from the group developing plans for a European Super League. “Having joined the group late last week, we have now had time to consider the matter fully and have decided that our continued participation in these plans would not be in the best interests of the Club, our supporters or the wider football community.”
