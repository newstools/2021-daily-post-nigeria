Mobile policemen in Niger State have killed six bandits during a gun battle in Garkogo, Shiroro local government area of the State. Many of the bandits, DAILY POST gathered, escaped with serious gun injuries, leaving behind their motorcycles. The mobile policemen were those stationed at Garkogo town after persistent attacks on the people by the bandits in recent time. DAILY POST also learnt that the bandits shot and killed a villager before the policemen appeared at the scene and engaged them in the fight at about 3:30 in the morning on Saturday. The success is coming barely three weeks after bandits launched an attack on the camp of the Joint Security Taskforce and killed five soldiers and one Civil Defence Officer at Allawa. A source at Garkogo told our reporter that four of the bandits were killed on the spot while bodies of two others were recovered from a farm in the afternoon, having died from bullet wounds. The source added that there was no casualty on the side of the policemen. Efforts to get reaction of the State Police command failed as the Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun could not be reached as of the time of filing this report.
