The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Sunday called on President Muhammadu Buhari to sack the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami. PDP made the call following Pantami’s alleged link to Taliban and Al-Qaeda, an allegation the minister has denied. The party explained that the President should wield the big stick against Pantami due to the matter’s sensitive nature. In a series of tweets, the former ruling party also called on the Department of State Services (DSS) to immediately invite Pantami for questioning. According to the tweets: “The party also demands that President @MBuhari should immediately sack the minister, given the sensitivity of the issue at stake. “Our party’s position is predicated on the heightening concerns in the public space and in the international arena of possible compromises by the communication minister, who has access to sensitive government documents and information, in addition to data of all individuals including high profile personalities in the public and private sectors as well as the traditional and faith-based circles. “The @OfficialPDPNig is particularly worried about allegations in the public suggesting that the minister compromised the NIN registration exercise by giving room for the registration of aliens and invaders from other countries as our citizens. “The party tasks the DSS to investigate the allegation, which has created apprehension, particularly given the rise in banditry and other terrorists activities in our country. “The @OfficialPDPNig urges Nigerians to remain at alert and very sensitive to their environment, while not hesitating in providing useful information to our security agencies in the interest of our nation.”
