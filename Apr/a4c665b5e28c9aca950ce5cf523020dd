Tottenham Hotspur may have to pay less than the reported £30million in pay-off, if they decide to sack Jose Mourinho as manager this summer, Daily Mail reports. Rumours had claimed Mourinho would be due a huge compensation if the club decided to sack him ahead of his contract expiring in 2023. The former Manchester United and Chelsea boss is said to be earning around £15million a year with Spurs and with no break clause, chairman Daniel Levy would have to stump up the remainder of his expected salary should he choose to let the manager go. However, Mourinho’s payout is dependent on Tottenham’s league position and if the club qualifies for Europe. Failure to reach the Champions League or Europa league would see his entitlement reduced in the event he was to lose his job.
