Former Manchester United player, Paul Ince, has predicted that the Red Devils will face many issues next season. Ince stated this following Man United’s goalless draw with Leeds United in the Premier League over the weekend. Man United have been handed a headache ahead of the transfer window opening this summer. However, with several players set to leave Man United, Ince believes that spending money will be crucial to avoid Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side drop in form. “They [Man United] are not as far off as we thought two years ago,” Ince told Sky Sports. “They are progressing gradually. “But on that performance [against Leeds], they are a long way, they have been so inconsistent this season it is hard to judge. “They need money, they need a striker. It looks like [Edinson] Cavani is going to Boca Juniors. They are going to have a lot of issues next season. “David de Gea is on £300k a week plus as a number two [goalkeeper]. [Paul] Pogba might be going. [Donny] Van de Beek cost £40m and can’t even get a game. “They are going to need to invest. But to win titles, you need consistent performances week in and week out. “And we have not seen that this season from United even if they have got the results.”
