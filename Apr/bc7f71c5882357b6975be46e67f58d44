A retired Army captain and founder of Fair Haven Security Nigeria Limited, David Mbamara has urged the Imo State government to thoroughly investigate the root cause of the repeated attacks in the state, rather than accusing the secessionist group, Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) of being responsible for all the attacks in recent times. Mbamara spoke to journalists in Owerri on Saturday while reacting to the attack on the Governor’s country home in Omuma by unidentified gunmen. According to him, “there may be other actors or people who could be hiding under the current security challenges to destabilize the government. “It is important that the security agents look deeper and come up with solutions to this disturbing development. This is not to say that the IPOB group is a saint. “The real enemies of the government may be moving freely, knowing very well that the government’s attention is on IPOB. “The government, both at the state and federal levels, have failed to address the issue of youth unemployment. Let me tell you, the greatest check against insecurity is the good welfare of the people. Here, government has not looked into that. “The cost of living is high. People have no jobs, and you expect a fair corporation from them. The people are not happy. Government should assuage the peoples feelings, and stop beating about the bush.” The Imo-born Rtd army captain, however, described the attack on the state correctional centre and the governor’s house in his country home, as the height of insecurity, calling for an urgent solution.
