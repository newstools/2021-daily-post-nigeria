Surgery is always a sporting and emotional break. “Fortunately, for a few days now I’ve been feeling better but in football and in life, bad luck also plays a role. “After yesterday’s game, I stayed on to do some work on the pitch and I felt a pinch in my left calf. Today I underwent tests and it was confirmed that I have a muscle injury. “What hurts most is not being able to help the team in these vital games of the season and not being able to give something back on the pitch for all the love and energy you send me. “All I can do is speak frankly, work hard and support the team with my soul.” Liverpool and Real Madrid played in the final of the 2018 Champions League with the Spanish giants emerging 3-1 winners.
