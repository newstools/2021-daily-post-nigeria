The leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has identified some Christian clerics, who according to him, are real prophets in Nigeria. He made the claim while addressing members of his church on Sunday on the true meaning of prophecy and why they are important. Speaking on where to find true prophets, Primate Ayodele revealed that there are so many of them in the world, and that they can be seen in lots of churches. Speaking further, he mentioned some names of those he remembers are true prophets of God. ‘’We have many prophets that when they speak, it comes to pass, Joshua Iginla is a prophet, Primate Olabayo is a Prophet, Apostle Suleman, Omotosho Tope Joseph, Ositelu, these are prophets of note that I can remember, they speak the heart of the Lord to the people, they are true prophets of God,” he said. “We have prophet in churches, we have in Celestial, Pentecostal, CAC, others, they speak in tongue and prophesy, you don’t need to blaspheme the Holy Spirit by opposing the prophet. “Prophecies are to guide against dangers, things to come, that is the essence. Some people go in trance, even the traditional worshippers, some use water, some use crystal ball, they have medium where they can see but there are people who hear directly from God, these are the prophets I am talking about, we also have Prophetesses.’’
