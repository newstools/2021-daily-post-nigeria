Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has insisted they can still win the LaLiga title this season, despite a 2-1 defeat to Real Madrid on Saturday. Karim Benzema and Toni Kroos gave Los Blancos the lead, before Mingueza pulled one back for Koeman’s men. Barca were denied a late penalty, as Real clinched the maximum points in the title race. The result saw Zinedine Zidane’s men go top with 66 points, ahead of rivals Atletico Madrid. Barcelona remain third with 65 points with eight matches left. “I am [still] really optimistic,” Koeman said of Barca’s title hopes. “We’ve shown that we are fighting. We have lost to a rival also fighting for the league, but there are [eight] games to go and every match for the top three will be tough.”
