The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha-Jet deployed for an operation against Boko Haram is still missing 24 hours after it went off radar. No traces have been found since Wednesday when the situation was reported in Borno State. The fighter aircraft lost contact with base at about 5pm while on an interdiction mission in support of ground troops. The jet was seen flying around Goni Kurmiri and Njimia villages after attacking terrorist locations at the Sambisa axis. The fear is that insurgents, known for possession of sophisticated weapons, might have shot the aircraft. The military says bad weather is hindering the search which commenced shortly after the disappearance. “Though no trace of the wreckage has been found, bad and hazy weather has been a stumbling block lately in the military operation. “We are still investigating what actually happened to the missing Alpha jet. Search and rescue have been intensified”, an officer told PRNigeria. The Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao arrived in Maiduguri on Thursday morning over the incident.
