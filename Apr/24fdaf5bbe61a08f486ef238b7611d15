Unknown Gunmen on Thursday attacked a First Bank Plc branch in Abagana, Dunukofia LGA, Anambra State, shooting sporadically into the air, dispersing bank customers and passersby. A source said the gunmen, numbering about ten, drove a black Honda Pilot Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) to the bank, and shot in all directions, causing panic, while also hoisting Biafra flags at the bank’s gate when all had fled. A source said, “They also set fire on a Nissan Pathfinder SUV with registration number UR 640 KJA and smashed the glasses of a Honda car with registration number FST 456 AC, parked in front of the bank.” Normal human and vehicular movements, however, continued after the gunmen left. The state police spokesperson, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga confirmed the attack to journalists but said he was working on a reaction to the attack. As at the time of filing this report, he was yet to give the official position of the Command, casualty figures or those involved.
