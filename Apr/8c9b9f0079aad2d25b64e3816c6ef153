The corpse of a lawyer, Mr Egbara Owan, has disappeared from a mortuary in Owakande 2 in Obubra Local Government Area of Cross River State. The programme for interment of the man had begun with a lying-in-state at the Obubra Magistrate Court but family members and sympathizers who gathered there had to disperse when the ambulance sent to the local mortuary to convey the corpse for the ceremony came back without the corpse. An eyewitness who preferred anonymity said, “Apparently, someone had gone to the mortuary to remove the corpse and when the family went there, the body was nowhere to be found.’ One James Okpa, a villager who attributed the disappearance of the corpse to squabble in the family said, “Mortuary attendants could not explain the whereabout of the corpse,” he stated. “The mortuary attendants could not explain who removed the body and investigations have been launched by community elders to find out what happened to the corpse. “The family seems to be in disagreement on the date of the burial but it is not known who took away the corpse. “Apparently someone had gone to the mortuary to remove the corpse and when the family went there to remove the body, it was nowhere to be found,” James Okpa said. He said investigation has been launched by community elders to find out what happened to the corpse. He said the police have not been invited into the matter yet because it is still seen as a family issue. “The matter is being handled internally first but from what the elders are saying, if by next week, the body is not located, the police would be contacted.” The deceased was a member of the Cross River State Judicial Service Commission.
