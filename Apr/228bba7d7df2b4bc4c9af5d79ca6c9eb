Jigawa State government has approved the reduction of official working hours in the State by two hours. This was stated in a statement by the Public Relations Officer, Office of the State Head of the Civil Service, Ismaila Ibrahim Dutse and issued to DAILY POST. He said the decision was due to the commencement of the 2021 Ramadan fast. The statement explained that civil servants in the State would now report to the office at 9am and close by 3pm between Monday and Thursday instead of 5pm. While Workers would report to work on Fridays by 9am and close by 1pm as usual. He said the gesture was aimed at providing more opportunities to civil servants to prepare for their Ramadan break and also to have more time to observe spiritual activities of the holy month. It is believed that civil servants in the State would use the Ramadan period to pray for Godâ€™s guidance and blessings for the State. The Head of Service, therefore, called on civil servants to use the fasting period to pray for peace and economic prosperity of the State and Nigeria at large.
