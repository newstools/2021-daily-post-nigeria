Local Government elections in Lagos State will be held in July after months of delay. The Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC) announced this on Tuesday. LASIEC Chairman, Hon. Justice Ayotunde Phillips (rtd) said the election would produce Chairman, Vice Chairman and Councillors in the 20 Local Government Councils and 37 LCDAs. Phillips noted that additional details, including the full-time, would be published soon. LASIEC is charged with the statutory responsibility of electoral management and administration in Lagos. The statement assured that the body is committed to conducting a free, fair, credible and inclusive election. The opposition had accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of deliberately avoiding the polls.
