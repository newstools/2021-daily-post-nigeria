The Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees, NULGE, on Thursday threatened to occupy the country homes of all Federal lawmakers over the plan to scrap the local government system. The local government workers made the threat in view of a bill before the House of Representatives seeking to abolish the third tier of Government. NULGE National President, Comrade Ambali Olatunji at a press conference in Enugu, warned that the sponsor of the bill, Hon. Bob Solomon from Rivers State and any lawmaker who shows support to it, would face the wrath of the workers. At the press conference were other national officers of NULGE, including the National Vice President, Southeast, Comrade Patrick Igwe and State Presidents, including that of Enugu, Comrade Kenneth Ugwueze. Adetunji said if the bill was not killed immediately, the workers would in the next few days stage a protest at the National Assembly, after which they would storm the country homes of all members of the parliament. “Our existence is being threatened, we will not sit down and watch. There will be a national protest there at the National Assembly. “They are no longer representing us, they are representing themselves. Bob Emmanuel, who benefited from the local government system has now become so disillusioned that he wants the system scrapped. “He is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, and that is why we have asked the party to call their son to order. Any person who attempts to kill the LG system is killing his own political future. No lawmaker who is on the side of masses should join the destructive move of Bob Solomon. We shall fight them all,” the workers declared. More to come…
