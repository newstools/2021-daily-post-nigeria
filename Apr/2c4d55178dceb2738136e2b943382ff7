Former Governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Kalu, has said that he has no ambition to become Nigeria’s President. Kalu, however, said he will not reject the offer if he was given, adding that he is capable mentally and otherwise to lead the country. Uzor Kalu also insisted that it is the turn of a Southeasterner of Igbo extraction to become President if Nigerians want to be fair. The former Abia Governor spoke during an interview with Channels Television on Sunday, adding that he does not believe that prophecies will take him to Aso Rock. He waved aside prophecies from some clergymen that he will be Nigeria’s next president. “I am not having that kind of ambition,” the former Abia State governor said in an interview on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics. “But if I am given, why not? I can take it. “I am a Catholic. In the Catholic church, we don’t see visions. Well, if visions are being seen, and people say this and that, if it is the will of God that I will become president, why not? “I am very capable mentally and otherwise to do whatever Nigerian people want me to do but not through prophecy,” the lawmaker noted. “I believe if Nigerians and the Nigerian people want to be fair, a Southeast president from Igbo extraction will be the next thing to do,” he explained.
