The Nigerian Immigration service has issued a warning to citizens against relocating abroad. The agency in a thread on its official Twitter page warned Nigerians to be careful of‘modern day slavery’ disguised as juicy offers disguised. The tweet read: “Hey guys you may need to think deeply over that bogus offer of a better life abroad. You may end up in modern day slavery. All that glitters is not gold.” The agency advised those who intend to travel abroad to reject juicy, attractive but fake offers for foreign trips. The tweet read: “TRAVEL ADVISORY
