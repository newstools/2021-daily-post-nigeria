Bournemouth winger, Arnaut Danjuma, has admitted he is considering his international future with the Netherlands and could switch to Nigeria. Danjuma was born in Lagos to a Dutch father and Nigerian mother. However, the 24-year-old has represented the Dutch U-21 side and featured twice for the senior team. He is, however, still eligible to represent the Super Eagles, according to new FIFA rules. Danjuma has now said he could take up the option if the Dutch senior team continues to snub him. “I’ve heard some bits about Nigeria but I can’t say too much about it though. My mum is Nigerian and my father lived 23 years in Nigeria as well. “The culture is still within the family, so it does not disregard the Nigerian side. It’s a choice I will think about but I need some time. “I think they are interested but obviously I play for the Dutch national team already, I scored for the national team already, so I’ve made that decision. “With the choice, I would like to represent Holland as well but then again I’m not being called up at the moment. So on the back of that, maybe I need to make some decisions,” Danjuma said according to the Bournemouth Echo.
