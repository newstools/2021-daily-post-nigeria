Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has revealed that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette and Kieran Tierney were all in contention to play against Villarreal. The Gunners take on Unai Emery’s side in the Europa League semi-final first leg on Thursday. Aubameyang, Lacazette and Tierney all missed the 1-0 defeat to Everton on Friday but could be available for selection in Spain. When asked about the condition of the trio on Wednesday at a pre-match press conference, the Arsenal manager told reporters: “They are all in contention, all of them – including Aubameyang, Laca and Kieran. They are all in contention for the game.” Arteta added on Tierney’s swift recovery from serious injury: “He didn’t need the surgery that at the beginning we were afraid of. Then he has been working like a beast every single day. “And I don’t know if he is going to make it tomorrow, but certainly he wants to be as close as possible to that football pitch to give himself the best possible chance.”
