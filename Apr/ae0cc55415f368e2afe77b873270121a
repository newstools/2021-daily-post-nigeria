Former Bulgaria striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted some of the Premier League fixtures that will be played this weekend. There will be only five games from Saturday to Monday, as Manchester City, Chelsea, Leicester City and Southampton are all involved in the FA Cup. Newcastle play West Ham at lunchtime Saturday, before Wolves and Sheffield United clash later. On Sunday, Arsenal welcome Fulham, before Burnley travel to Manchester United. Liverpool are away at Leeds on Monday night. On Arsenal vs Fulham, Berbatov told Betfair: “Fulham have struggled, and survival is looking even more complicated. Arsenal have been really poor this season, but they had that great win last time out in the Europa League so they will be confident. Even though Fulham are desperate for the points, I think Arsenal will win this one. Prediction 2-1.” Berbatov, speaking about the United vs Burnley game, said: “Solskjaer has said United aren’t out of the title race yet, that makes this match a must win game. They need to win these games if they want to be title contenders. They could close the gap to eight points with six games to go with a win, which I think they will do. Prediction 2-1.” On Leeds vs Liverpool, he added: “That is a good game. Both sides have great attacking talent and I hope we will see an exciting match. Last time out Leeds surprised us all against City and I think they can serve it up to Liverpool, but Klopp’s side will be desperate for the points to get into the top four so I will go with a draw. Prediction 2-2.”
