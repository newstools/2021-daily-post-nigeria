The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami has hinted Nigerians about the release of doctored videos, which he claims are designed to malign him. According to him, the clips have been edited to show him in a compromising condition. Pantami, in a statement through his spokesman, Uwa Suleiman, made it clear he will not sit idly and watch his hard-earned reputation as an Islamic scholar destroyed. “We are in receipt of credible intelligence that the same forces who have been championing a well-coordinated and richly funded campaign against the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, are now unto the next stage of their diabolic project. “This time around, the forces of evil are shopping for willing partners as well as their usual avenues, to release doctored videos purporting to show the Honourable Minister in an alleged compromising condition, as a way of creating injury on his image,” the statement said. It added that: “After concocting lies and half-truths linking the Honourable Minister with terrorism, despite his well-documented stance against Boko Haram and similar groups, these adversaries went to the extent of doctoring a document with capacity to endanger national security.” Last week, the Nigerian govt publicly supported Pantami amid calls for his resignation or sacking. The calls followed revelations which linked the Minister with terrorist organisations – Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
