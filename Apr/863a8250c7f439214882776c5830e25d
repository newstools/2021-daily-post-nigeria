Liverpool forwards, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane are set to equal the club’s former players, Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen’s records when they tackle Real Madrid in tonight’s Champions League quarter-final second-leg tie at Anfield. Salah will equal a club record set by Gerrard, should he score against Real Madrid in England. The Egyptian international has scored in each of Liverpool’s last four Champions League games, and a goal tonight would match Gerrard’s feat of netting in five consecutive European matches. Gerrard did so twice for the Premier League champions – first straddling the 2004-05 and 2005-06 campaigns and then in 2007-08. Meanwhile, should Mane score against Real Madrid, he will join Owen in joint-third place on the club’s all-time European goalscorers chart with 22 – behind only Gerrard and Salah. Liverpool disclosed this in a post via its website on Wednesday morning. Jurgen Klopp’s side had lost 3-1 against the LaLiga champions in the first-leg in Spain last week.
