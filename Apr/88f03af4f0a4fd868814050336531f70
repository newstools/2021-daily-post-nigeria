Jose Mourinho has rejected his first job offer a week after his sacking by Tottenham Hotspur. Mourinho reportedly turned down the offer on the ground that he is not ready to return to management at the moment. Sunday Times football journalist, Duncan Castles claimed that the Portuguese tactician has turned down offers from Scottish giants, Celtic, telling them he is not ready to return to the game just yet. Mourinho, 58, was sacked by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy last Monday, less than a week before their Carabao Cup final against Manchester City, which they lost 1-0. And Celtic was one of the teams believed to have called the former Chelsea boss to handle their team “My information is that the first of those approaches came from Celtic Football Club, who are in need of significant managerial change,” Duncan told the Transfer Window podcast. “They are in need of a change of fortune to get themselves back on top of the heap in Scotland after Steven Gerrard guided Rangers to the Scottish title by a significant margin. “My understanding is that his response to that approach from Celtic – not ready to coach now. There have been other offers.”
