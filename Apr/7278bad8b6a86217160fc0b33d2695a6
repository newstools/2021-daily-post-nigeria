Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has disclosed that the Kroenke family (the club’s owner) apologized to him and his players over the Gunners’ failed European Super League plan. Arteta stated this on Thursday ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Everton on Friday night at Emirates. Arsenal, along with Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham and Liverpool, were one of the 12 founding members of the European Super League, which was created to replace the Champions League and the Europa League. But after widespread criticisms from fans, pundits, and some key figures in football, all six Premier League clubs announced on Tuesday night that they were withdrawing from the competition. When asked if he and his players have received an apology from the club’s hierarchy, Arteta said at his pre-match press conference: “Yes. Starting from Vinai, the ownership and everybody that is involved in the process. “All of them, with the right intentions to defend the club and put the club in the best possible position for now and for the future, but accepting that the way it’s been handled has had terrible consequences and that it was a mistake. “I really have to respect that when people have genuine intentions to do the best for this football club. But if it doesn’t happen or not the right thing to do, they can stand up here and apologize.
“I’m speaking for myself, and I think the players, staff, everybody working at the club, we have to accept that and move on. The way it’s been handled has been really good internally.”
