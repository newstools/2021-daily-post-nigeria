Lille captain Jose Fonte, has advised Manchester City on the easiest possible way to beat Paris Saint-Germain as both teams clash in the Champions League semi-final first leg on Wednesday. Conte was part of the Lille’s team that beat the French champions 1-0 earlier this month and the Portuguese have now told City the best tactic to counter their Ligue 1 title rivals, advising them to “wind up Neymar!” Neymar actually saw red in the closing stages of the fixture against Lille after clashing with defender Tiago Djalo. “He does indeed get very easily wound up. Although he got sent off quite late in the game, they were losing so he was quite frustrated,” Fonte told talkSPORT. “I’m sure that you hope he has learned from his mistakes, but if you have a player that is quite good at winding up people then I think that could be quite a good tactic. “If Neymar is not playing then it’s so much easier, so let’s see what happens tonight. “The way we did it was pressing them high. It was by playing together, defending in numbers and with a low block. “Everyone did a great job, the forwards and midfielders did extremely well to help. That was the only way to stop them – in our case. “Then with the transition, we were able to create a lot of good occasions, but it’s definitely a tough challenge and you’ve got to pay attention at all times – especially to them two [Kylian Mbappe and Neymar].”
