Obiano who disclosed this at the Prof. Dora Akunyili Women’s Development Centre in Awka said: “What happened last month is unfortunate, but let me tell you, we have restrategized and we are coming out like a smoking gun. “We are not going to take prisoners. The nine people that attacked Prof Soludo are in our net now. We are going to eliminate them. We will go after the others. “We are not going to take prisoners any longer. A special squad have already been put together, and they are already working everywhere,” Obiano said.
