Nigerians have been advised to imbibe the spirit of love, unity and togetherness to end insecurity in the country. The founder of Treasure of God Deliverance Ministry, Evangelist Lanre Adebayo who gave the advice said the lack of love and covenant of ethnicity is fuelling the crisis in Nigeria. The cleric who posited that Nigeria’s challenges persist because there is no fear of God, said many, including men of God are looking for money, wealth and fame at all costs. He spoke during the 7th anniversary of the ministry with the theme: “The King of The Perfection”. “The bible says, the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. Without the fear of God, no leader will have the wisdom to rule the people without a myriad of challenges. “All we need to do is to return to God and seek His face, when we call on Him, He will hear our voices”. Prophet Adebayo who is also a gospel musician stressed the need for the people to jettison tribalism and ethnic profiling and be their brother’s keeper. “This could be traced to most of the challenges staring our country in the face. Hausas don’t want to have anything to do with the Fulanis, Yoruba don’t want to agree with the Igbos, Fulanis, Igbo and even Yoruba’s are always in disagreement. “This is also happening among religious bodies and faith-based organizations in the country. We must seek the spirit of unity in all our ways. If this is done, love will stand. God is love without love there will be no peace”. While maintaining that love will bring about peace in the country, he said ” If there is love, there will be no kidnapping, killing but where is the love today. When the bible says love your neighbour as yourself. What we need now is love, not lust. We must return to God and be united as people”. Apart from Prophet Alo, who was represented by his personal assistant, Hon Deji Ogunbusuyi, other dignitaries at the event include, Prophet M A Abiola, Lady Evangelist Bisi Alawiye-Aluko, Biyi Samuel among others
