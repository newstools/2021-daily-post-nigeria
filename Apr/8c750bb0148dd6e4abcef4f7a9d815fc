Former Chelsea star, Joe Cole has described Jorginho and Marcos Alonso as standout flops in Chelsea’s humiliating 5-3 defeat to West Brom at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Christian Pulisic put the home side ahead but then things went south very quickly for the Blues with Thiago Silva being sent off in the 28th minute. Matheus Pereira then scored twice for the visitors shortly before half time and in the second period, Tuchel’s side became totally capitulated. Mbaye Diagne struck and Callum Robinson netted a brace either side of a goal from Mason Mount which gave Chelsea a fleeting hope. Cole blamed both players for their poor performances in an array of disappointing displays by Thomas Tuchel side at home by Chelsea. With the unsavoury result, Tuchel lost his unbeaten record as Chelsea manager in spectacular fashion. Cole picked out midfielder Jorginho and left-back Alonso as notably bad players. “The first 20 or 30 minutes there were sloppy passes, we’ve not seen that under the Tuchel reign so far,’ Cole told BT Sport. “Jorginho is usually so assured with the ball, aware of what’s going on around him. He gave the ball away more than I’ve ever seen him today. “Alonso wasn’t on it, on the front foot, we’ve seen him play very very well in recent weeks.”
