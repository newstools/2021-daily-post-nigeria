Former Liverpool defender, Jamie Carragher, has claimed that Kelechi Iheanacho can be Leicester City’s long-term solution when Jamie Vardy eventually leaves the Foxes in the coming years. Carragher said this after Iheanacho led Leicester City to defeat Crystal Palace 2-1 in the Premier League on Monday. Iheanacho scored the second goal for Leicester against Crystal Palace to take his goal tally to 14 in his last 14 games in all competitions for his team. “He [Iheanacho] was the best player on the pitch by a long way,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “For so long, this team, Leicester, have been spoken about as a Jamie Vardy team. If Vardy’s injured, Leicester will struggle or what about (when Vardy leaves) in two or three years time? How will they replace him? “And you look at him [Iheanacho] right now, he’s been there a few years, it hasn’t worked out, he cost £25m to £30m, but he’s shown what he’s about.”
