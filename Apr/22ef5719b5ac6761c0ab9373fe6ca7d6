The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has put on hold the registration for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE) which was billed to commence Thursday. A statement by the Boards Head of Media and Protocol, Dr. Fabian Benjamin in Abuja said the delay follows the exam body’s effort to ensure that candidates have access to its registration app for the 2021 UTME/DE and also finalise work on its pin vending process before the take-off of the exercise. The exam body advised prospective candidates to follow up on advertisements for the 2021 registration exercise to understand the steps involved and the actual date of the registration exercise. ”To be sure all processes are completed before the commencement, the Board didn’t place its advertorial as it was yet to complete the process of a smooth pin vending and candidate access to the registration app for the 2021 UTME/DE. ”This delay is caused by some unforeseen circumstances occasioned by our determined effort to have a NIN integration. This challenge is being resolved and once that is done, all processes shall commence.
