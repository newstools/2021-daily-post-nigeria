Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has predicted that midfielder, Mason Mount, has the potential to reach double figures in goals for the club every season. Mount has been earning lots of praise for his performances for Chelsea this season under Tuchel and former Blues manager, Frank Lampard. The 22-year-old star has scored six goals and registered four assists in the Premier League so far this season for Chelsea. The England international set up one of Chelsea’s four goals in their 4-1 win over Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday. Mount has netted eight goals in all competitions for Chelsea so far this campaign as he looks to reach double figures for the Stamford Bridge club. Asked if Mount could become a 20 goal-a-season player for Chelsea, Tuchel said at his post-match after Chelsea’s victory against Crystal Palace over the weekend: “Twenty would be huge! Then I would maybe not call him a midfielder anymore, but a striker. “But he has that potential which you can’t learn. You have the composure, you have the technique, you have the precision, you have the feeling to score the goals, or you don’t have it. “I think he can be the type of guy who can produce double figures in every season. “He is just in the middle of it right now, and I don’t want him to stop now. It is crucial.” Mount will hope to continue his spectacular display for Tuchel’s men when they tackle Porto in the Champions League quarter-final second-leg tie on Tuesday.
