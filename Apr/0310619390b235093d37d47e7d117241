Chukwuma Soludo, a former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has narrated the attack on his entourage on Wednesday in Anambra State. DAILY POST reports that gunmen opened fire during a town hall meeting he attended at the Isuofia community in Aguata Local Government Area. Three of his police guards were murdered; the incident sparked outrage. He told Channels Television’s Politics Today that the incident lasted “10 or 15 minutes of continuous gun battle”. The economist recalled that he was about to wrap up the meeting and request comment from those in attendance. “By the time we all came back, we saw three bodies lying in the pool of their blood. They were the three policemen. May God grant their soul eternal rest. “I thought the policemen were shooting in the air. Until I began to hear people screaming and all of that and everybody just scampered for safety.” Soludo condoled the families of the slain officers and promised to support them. Soludo is the leading governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) for the November election. He described the attack as senseless, adding that the race for political office should not cost human lives. The Police have arrested five suspects connected to the incident.
