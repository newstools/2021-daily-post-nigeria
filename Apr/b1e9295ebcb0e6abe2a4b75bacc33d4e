The Coalition of Northern Groups, CNG, has asked the Nigerian Consumer Protection Council to emulate the initiative set by the Kano State Anti Corruption Commission to checkmate the tendency for essential commodity price hike as the Ramadan month of fasting approaches. The CNG hailed the decision of Alhaji Abdussamad Isyaku Rabiu, Chairman BUA Groups to sanction any erring dealer that hike the prices of essential commodities allocated by BUA during the Ramadan period. A statement by the CNG’s spokesman, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, warned against the ungodly action by marketers which exposes worshippers and the general public to severe hardship of hike in prices of foodstuff. The statement frowned at the unpatriotic motive of marketers to exploit the citizenry at times of need such as the Ramadan period and urged NCPC to take steps that would address the ugly situation. According to the statement, “We find the Kano Agency’s action in warning marketers against such exploitation very proactive and BUA’s sanction threat commendable and humanely considerate. “As we pray for improved peace in the country, we warn all potential exploiters of our resolve to assist in enforcing the Kano and BUA directives, while calling on Muslims to offer prayers for the leadership of the BUA Groups.” The groups noted that it was regrettable that fellow Nigerian Muslim marketers would want to exploit their brethren at such sacred periods of worship as the Ramadan and Sallah. The CNG noted that it was only the ungodly that would enjoy making capital at the expense of the larger society during such period.
