Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has hit the Nigerian Air Force for failing to thank the state government for buying two armoured helicopters for them. Wike said the armoured helicopters worth over $10 million that the state government gave to the Nigerian Air Force to fight crude oil theft and sea piracy in the state have been diverted to fight Boko Haram. The governor stated this at the re-launch of the defunct C4i, a security architecture put in place by the previous administration to fight insecurity in Rivers State. The Governor, who pledged to continue to provide all Security agencies in the state with logistic support, said cases where hoodlums ambush police officers and cart away their arms should be a thing of the past, adding that, “in pursuit of our desire to ensure the safety of lives and property in Rivers State, we today re-launched Rivers State’s security outfit tagged C4I. His words, “Personnel of the outfit which comprises 400 policemen and 200 civil defence personnel have in the last month been specially trained in relevant skills to ensure they carry out their duty efficiently. “Let the Nigerian Air Force know that the Rivers State Government gave them two armoured helicopters. The former Chief of Air Staff never wrote to thank us. Which state has done it for Nigerian Air Force in this country? Not one. Even while he was former Chief of Air Staff, he never came here to thank us. But he was using our own armoured helicopter,” he said.
