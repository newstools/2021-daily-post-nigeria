A suspected fake lawyer, 50-year-old Azeez Agboola, had confessed to the police that though he read law in the university, he has not been called to Bar because did not pass the law school examination.” Agboola was arrested by men of the Ogun State Police Command, “for unlawfully parading himself as a legal practitioner.” The suspect, a resident of Oko Afo area of Badagry, Lagos State, was arrested while appearing as a counsel before Chief Magistrate B. I. Ilo, at the Chief Magistrate Court, Agbara. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST that the suspect’s presentation in court aroused the suspicion of the judge, who invited the police to arrest him for proper interrogation, to authenticate his claim of being a lawyer. “Upon his arrest, the suspect was personally interrogated by the DPO of Agbara division, SP Dahiru Saleh and he confessed that though he read law in the university, he has not been called to Bar since he has not passed the law school examination.” Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun has ordered that the suspect be charged to court as soon as possible.
