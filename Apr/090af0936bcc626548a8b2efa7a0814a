Manchester United legend, Roy Keane has responded to Paul Pogba’s criticism of Jose Mourinho. Keane lambasted the Frenchman who, in a recent interview, praised current Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and claimed he “wouldn’t go against his players” the way Mourinho did. Pogba told Sky Sports: “What I have now with Ole is different, he wouldn’t go against the players. He wouldn’t go against the players. “Maybe Ole wouldn’t pick them, but it’s not like he puts them on the side like they don’t exist anymore. That’s the difference between Mourinho and Ole. “Once I had a great relationship with Mourinho, everybody saw that, and the next day you don’t know what happened.” “That’s the strange thing I had with Mourinho and I cannot explain to you because even I don’t know. So, yeah.” But Keane in his response, believes that the Frenchman was not signed by Manchester United to criticise and compare managers but to win trophies. Keane told Sky Sports, “He’s saying he didn’t like Mourinho and he now likes Ole, it’s not necessarily about liking your manager, it’s about going out and doing the business week in week out. “This idea that he loves Ole, that doesn’t guarantee you trophies. It’s about respecting your manager. “They’re different managers but I tell you what, I like the look of Mourinho’s CV. “He’s talking about this stuff with Mourinho, you put that to one side. You’re playing for Manchester United, whatever you think of your manager, you put it to one side. “I’m sure Jose would admit he’s made mistakes, but I played under great managers and they all made mistakes. Sometimes you have to get on with it. “It’s not like Pogba’s only been there for 12 months, he’s been there for three or four years and it’s not exactly like Manchester United have been competing for trophies. “When United signed Pogba, it wasn’t to be playing in the Europa League and to be trying to win the League Cup.”
