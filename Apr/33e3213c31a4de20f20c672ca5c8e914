The State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs in Kaduna State, Samuel Aruwan, has confirmed the death of one person from the attack on the private university in the state on Tuesday night. Aruwan during a visit to the school told newsmen that the victim is a staff of Greenfield University. He said the number of students abducted was yet to be ascertained, but will be confirmed after a headcount of the students. “Yesterday Tuesday 20th of April 2021, at 8:30pm we received a distress call that armed bandits were attacking Greenfield University and were shooting sporadically. “Immediately, troops and other security agencies were deployed to the institution to handle the situation. “The troops did not come in contact with the bandits because they escaped but unfortunately a staff of the university was killed by the bandits. “Furthermore, an unspecified number of students were kidnapped, as we speak we are still working around the general area so that we can get the actual figure,” he said. The commissioner, however, assured residents that the military and security agencies are working round the clock for their release, “We will keep you informed on other developments”.
