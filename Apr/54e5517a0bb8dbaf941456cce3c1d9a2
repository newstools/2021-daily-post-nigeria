Eden Hazard is now ready to face his former club, Chelsea in the Champions League semi-finals. Hazard left Chelsea for Real Madrid in 2019 for a fee of around £100m after seven trophy-laden years at Stamford Bridge. However, the Belgium International has struggled with injuries and form since moving to the Spanish capital, making only 14 appearances in all competitions this season. The La Liga giants will face Chelsea in the Champions League semi-finals after overcoming another Premier League side, Liverpool, 3-1 on aggregate in the quarter-final with Thomas Tuchel’s seeing off FC Porto to reach the stage first time in seven years. Zidane said that Hazard is now back and ready, starting with Real Madrid’s clash against Getafe tonight. “He is feeling very better and he is ready,’ Zidane told a press conference on Saturday evening. “He wants to be back more than anyone else. We have been more cautious with [Dani] Carvajal and Hazard, because they are relapses. “They are both better and that is good for the team.”
