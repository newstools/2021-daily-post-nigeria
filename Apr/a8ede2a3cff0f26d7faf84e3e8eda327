Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has blamed individual mistakes for his side’s 2-2 draw with Newcastle United on Sunday. Joelinton gave Newcastle the lead in 28 minutes before Harry Kane’s brace put Spurs in front after the first 45 minutes. However, Arsenal loanee Joe Willock scored a late equalizer for the Magpies as both teams shared a point each. “It’s not a good point. We came here with the objective to win it, so (I am) not happy with a point,” Mourinho said at a post-match press conference. “I don’t want to go very deep on my analysis because what I feel, what I think, what I want to say, cannot be with you. It can only be in the dressing room.” He added, “I would say that (there were) too many individual mistakes and then mistakes give instability and maybe then give that perception that you have (instability). “For example, in the second half, we are balanced, we are not open, we have more numbers than them in the point where the cross is coming, we have positional control of the first man for the first ball, we have two against one for the second ball in the face of the goal, so we were not too open.” Tottenham will now face Manchester United on April 11 in their next game.
