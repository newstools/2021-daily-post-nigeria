A 100 Level student of the Plateau State University (PLASU), Bokkos, who reportedly fell off a vehicle during students protest is dead. He died as result of the injuries he sustained from the accident. The deceased, Isreal Emmanuel, was the class Rep of the Mathematics Department of the university. The Vice Chancellor of the institution, Prof. Yohana Izam, confirmed Emmanuel’s death in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday. The Vice Chancellor, however, described the death of the student as “very sad” and “unfortunate”. “To us as an institution, Emmanuel’s death is shocking and a great loss to us considering the cause of his death. “We have been cautioning the students against demonstration and protests, which are not jamborees, yet they keep doing it. “Our pain and regret is that the Monday protest has robbed us of a precious soul and forced us into mourning,” Izam lamented. —
