Former Juventus striker, Luka Toni, has said he was “not impressed” by Cristisano Ronaldo’s outburst after their game against Genoa last weekend. Toni questioned Ronaldo’s attitude after the Portuguese threw his shirt away after Juventus 3-2 win over Genoa. Dejan Kulusevski, Alvaro Morata and Weston McKennie were the goalscorers for Juventus The former Manchester United and Real Madrid forward appeared unhappy despite the victory after he fired blank. Toni used himself as an example, saying that even when he failed to score during matches, he still remained on the pitch to congratulate those who did and celebrate with them. He said the 36-year-old was wrong not to stay on the pitch and celebrate with his teammates. “He’s very important for Juventus,” the former Bianconeri forward told Tuttosport. “He’s the leading goalscorer, he scored a lot. But I’m not impressed by some of his attitude towards the group. I think back to when I was playing. “I was very selfish and if I didn’t score, I still remained on the pitch to celebrate anyway. I endured the disappointment. “Regardless of whether it was a coincidence or not, you don’t throw the shirt. Sometimes a great champion has to lead by example.”
