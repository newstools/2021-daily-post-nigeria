The Nigerian Army says it will train Nigerian Correctional Service personnel (NCoS) on prison protection. The Acting Controller General of Corrections, John Mrabure had, in a letter to the Chief of Army Staff, requested assistance to that effect. The engagement will help the personnel suppress armed non-state actors. Recall that at least 3 jailbreaks have happened in Nigeria in the last six months, with some unsuccessful attempts. Francis Enobore, NCos spokesman, in a statement disclosed that the training will cover “relevant tactical components”. He said the partnership with the Army is one of the strategies to resist and prevent further violation of custodial centres. Since 2010 when Boko Haram invaded the Bauchi Custodial Centre and freed their members and others, hoodlums have attacked prisons across the country. On Wednesday, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), the Army and the Police Edo foiled a jailbreak at an NCoS facility at Ubiaja in Edo.
