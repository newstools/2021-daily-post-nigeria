Manchester City playmaker, Kevin De Bruyne, has taken a veiled swipe at Leicester City following his side’s Premier League 2-0 victory against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium on Saturday. De Bruyne said Man City’s match against Brendan Rodgers’ really defensive Leicester side was basically a “one team playing” game. According to the Belgium international, Leicester only had one chance that was offside during the encounter. Pep Guardiola’s side defeated Leicester, thanks to goals from Benjamin Mendy and Gabriel Jesus in the second half of the encounter. “I thought it was really good today, especially the first half, which we totally dominated,” De Bruyne told Sky Sports. “They had the one chance that was offside with [Jamie] Vardy but basically, it was one team playing. “In the second half, Leicester did a little bit better, but I think if you look at the 90 minutes, it was 2-0, and I think we deserved even more goals. “After an international break, that’s really well done from the team.”
