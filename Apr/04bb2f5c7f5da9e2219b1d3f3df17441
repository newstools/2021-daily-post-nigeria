Nigerian Pastor, Rev. Patrick-Grace Henry of the Grace Family Outreach has described Nigerian football legend Austin ‘Jay Jay’ Okocha as a disgrace to his generation. The pastor is angry at Okocha over his decision to use his image to promote a betting company. Addressing his congregation in a viral video, Pastor Henry said he is ready to confront the football legend over this. Noting that the former Bolton Wanderers midfielder brought joy to the hearts of many people during his playing days, he described the ex-Super Eagle captain as one of the best in the world, who Nigerians loved to watch live or on the television. He, however, lambasted the 47-year-old for being the face of a betting company, saying, “”Any day I see Okocha, I will tell him that he is a disgrace to this generation because he was the first footballer who played soccer for people to enjoy. ”Okocha never bet his way to football, but shame onto him for becoming the face of a betting company despite how he made his name. ”How can someone like Okocha be promoting betting with his image? it is a shame and I want him to know that he is a disgrace.” Video….
