Newcastle legend, Alan Shearer has called on the Premier League to without delay, ban Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. Shearer made the call over the ‘top six’ team’s involvement in the new European Super League. Chelsea, Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool have all signed up as founding members of the new breakaway league alongside Spanish topsides, Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Italian giants Juventus, AC Milan and Inter. The plans have been met with widespread backlash and Shearer, a Premier League legend, wants the management of the Premier League to take action against the clubs immediately. “The Super League have chucked a grenade at the Premier League and to everyone else. Well, chuck one back. Ban them. Ban them immediately if you can,” Shearer told BBC Breakfast. “I am sure they will look at every possible legal angle and what pressure they are under in doing that but if you can, do it. Absolutely.”
