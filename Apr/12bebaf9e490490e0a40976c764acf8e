Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel has included Nigerian-born youngster Tino Anjorin, in the Blues’ squad against Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final first leg tie in Spain on Tuesday. Anjorin, 19, has made just five appearances for Chelsea and only started a dead rubber against Krasnador in the Champions League group stages in December. Experienced midfielder and former Real Madrid star, Mateo Kovacic will not be part of the show in Spain, having failed to recover from a hamstring issue. Kovacic is, however, the only absentee in Thomas Tuchel’s squad for the trip to Madrid but the German tactician is clearly keen on having reinforcements in midfield, with the 19-year-old Anjorin selected to travel with the Chelsea squad for the first leg. It remains to be seen whether the teenager will be selected as a substitute against Real Madrid, with Tuchel likely to go with N’Golo Kante, Jorginho and Mason Mount in midfield. The Blues are looking forward to a reunion with their former hitman, Eden Hazard, who will be on the side of the Spanish giants when they lock horns on Tuesday evening. Hazard, who left Chelsea in 2019, has overcome his injury and is set to help Zinedine Zidane’s side knock Chelsea out of the competition.
