Abdulaziz Yari, a former governor of Zamfara State, has cautioned the state governor, Bello Matawalle, that he would lose his seat if he leaves the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, going by the Supreme Court verdict that brought him to office in 2019. Yari disclosed this at the secretariat of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Gusau on Sunday, during the distribution of N1.3billon assorted grains he purchased for the party’s supporters as a Ramadan gift. The former Governor, who was represented by Senator Kabiru Marafa, said nobody had informed them either in writing or verbally that Matawalle was defecting to the APC. He, however, warned that the Supreme Court nullified the election of the APC candidates in 2019 and declared the PDP candidates as winners who would remain in power till 2023. “As such, until after that period, any PDP elected officer who defects to another party must also vacate his seat going by the court’s judgment,” Yari said. According to Yari, Matawalle was being misled by some people to join the APC, “forgetting the circumstances that have made him become the governor of the state.” Recall that reports had emerged that Matawalle had concluded plans to dump the PDP after some APC Governors visited him. However, the Governor’s participation at the PDP Governors’ meeting in Makurdi last Friday appears now to be a big disappointment to those who peddled the rumour that he was about to defect to the APC. Matawalle was in high spirits when he met with his colleagues and commended Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State for being a wonderful host.
