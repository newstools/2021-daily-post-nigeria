Prophet Joshua Arogun, the General Overseer of Light of the World International Church, has predicted that a former Governor from the Southern part of the country, will replace President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. During his church service held in Lagos on Sunday, the cleric said it was his primary duty to tell people anything God reveals to him. “I am a prophet of God and by the grace of God, anything the Lord tells us comes to pass because we hear from Him; we don’t hear from men. We don’t rely on public opinion for prophecies. “Before the election last year (2019), God told me that President Buhari would be re-elected; And God told me a lot of things about Buhari,” he said. Prophet Arogun also claimed he got a clear message about the 2023 election said, “I got a revelation about Nigeria’s political dynamics in the next general election. “I saw a man in Prison (now released) and this man has been a former Governor from the South East taking over from President Buhari. “There is absolutely nothing one can do about someone’s destiny especially when sanctioned by God,” he said.
