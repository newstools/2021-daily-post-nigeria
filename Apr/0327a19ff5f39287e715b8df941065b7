A pressure group, Igbo National Council (INC) Worldwide has given the Governor of Ebonyi State a twenty-one-day ultimatum to resign, accusing him of conspiring with killer Fulani herders to kill his people. The group said Governor Umahi should step aside so as to face trial of alleged conspiracy on the recent killing of armless Ebonyi citizens. Chilos Godsent, the National President of the group, in a press statement on Thursday, said the Governor’s actions in recent times, were indicative of his support for the Jihadist killer herdsmen. According to him, while many Southern and North central states governors vehemently rejected the proposed obnoxious RUGA project in a bid to protect their citizens, Engr. David Umahi was busy ceding huge acres of lands of Ebonyi State to the Fulani for their settlement in exchange to win their support for his 2023 Presidential ambition. “Governor David Umahi is the most dangerous among all the Governors in the history of Igbo nation, because he has the tendency to betray his people at any slightest opportunity. “We must do everything within our powers to bring Governor Umahi to book now or after his tenure as governor. He is an enemy of Ndigbo. “We call on the Ebonyi State House of Assembly to immediately commence the impeachment of Governor David Umahi if he fails to voluntarily resign after twenty-one days from 2nd April, 2021, so as to stop him from bringing more shame to Ebonyi people,” the group said. DAILY POST recalls that the dreaded Fulani herders massacred over sixteen Ebonyi people on Monday night and threatened to kill more should anyone stand on their way.
