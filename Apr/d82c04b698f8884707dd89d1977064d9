The Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle on Friday attended the People’s Democratic Party, PDP Governors Forum meeting in Benue State. Matawalle’s attendance has put to rest rumours of his alleged plans to dump the party for the All Progressives Congress, APC. Reports had emerged that Matawalle had concluded plans to dump the PDP after some Governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC visited him. However, his participation at the PDP Governors meeting in Makurdi appears now to be a huge disappointment to those who peddled the rumour that he was about to defect to the APC. The Governor was in high spirits when he met with his colleagues and commended Governor Samuel Ortom for being a wonderful host.
