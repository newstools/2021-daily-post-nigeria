Former Liverpool and Manchester United striker, Michael Owen, has handed England manager, Gareth Southgate, players’ names to use at the upcoming Euro 2020 this summer. The Euro 2020 campaign kicks off in the next two months. England will face Croatia on June 13 in their first group match before playing Scotland and the Czech Republic, with all three group games taking place at Wembley Stadium. But Owen wants Southgate to play Declan Rice and Jordan Henderson as the two holding midfielders, Harry Kane as centre-forward, Raheem Sterling on the left, Phil Foden on the right, Jack Grealish as the No.10, Jordan Pickford as the goalkeeper, Reece James as the right-back. “This is definitely the other area that is a real conundrum for Gareth Southgate, “Owen told Stadium Astro. “In terms of centre-forward, there’s only one player, that’s Harry Kane, he’s written in stone. “What we are thinking England will do is play four at the back, two holding midfield players, Rice and Henderson if he’s fit maybe, or the lad from Leeds [Kalvin Phillips] has been playing in recent games. “And then we think there’s going to be three players behind Harry Kane. You could list so many, Rashford, Foden, Grealish, Maddison is not really getting a mention, Sancho is another one that could be considered. “I think he might find a place for Foden, I think Rashford’s pace is going to be really important. You’ve got to have Sterling in your team. He’s been fantastic over the years. “If it was me, I would go Grealish as No.10, Foden on the right and Sterling on the left and maybe use Rashford as an impact player.” He added, “I think that Southgate is going to stick with what he’s got and go with Pickford. “Reece James is probably the likeliest player to play right-back.”
