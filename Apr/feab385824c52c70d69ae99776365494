Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has slammed the new Champions League format proposed by UEFA this week. The new format will see the competition expanded to accommodate 36 teams in the group stages. Klopp, speaking ahead of Saturday’s Premier League match against Newcastle, again lashed out at packing more matches into a season. According to the German, football clubs were already operating “on the edge” of maximum capacity. He said: “We have to make sure there’s no harm from [the Super League], no different atmosphere in the club. Let’s go back to the beautiful game it always was. “I am not naive — I have no problem with change and while the Super League is away, in the same moment the new Champions League is out there. “Who read this concept properly and says ‘oh that’s perfect!’ And who doesn’t know it’s not about money? It’s a joke.” —
