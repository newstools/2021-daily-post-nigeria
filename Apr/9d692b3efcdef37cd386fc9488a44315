The Proprietor and Chancellor of Gregory University Uturu, in Abia State, Professor Greg Ibe, has stated that the act of governance is a continuous process, characterised by seamless transfer of projects and policies from one regime to another. Ibe, a Professor of Entrepreneurial Science made the assertion during a parley with newsmen, on Wednesday. He commended Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia state for building on the foundations laid by his predecessors, thereby working towards the realization of the Abia masterplan. According to Professor Ibe, “This is the policy that has now led to the construction of solid paved roads built with cement technology by Governor Ikpeazu, from the old foundation of coal tar roads as was done by his predecessors. By so doing, the Governor has subsequently prepared a good ground for continuity by his successor. “The foundations laid by Governor Ikpeazu constitute good building blocks for his successor to accelerate the pace of development, in furtherance of the masterplan designed by the founding fathers of our great state. “I am particularly impressed with the great work done by the Governor in the area of changing the narrative of our people towards locally produced goods and services,” he added. Ibe further made a case for adoption of the policy of phasal development as a way of encouraging the concept of building society incrementally, thereby ensuring that succeeding regimes sustain the projects and policies of past administrations. He said this will guarantee continuity while discouraging constant abandonment of projects.
