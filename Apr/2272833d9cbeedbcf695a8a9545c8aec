Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has admitted they cannot land Borussia Dortmund striker, Erling Haaland, to replace Sergio Aguero this summer. Haaland has emerged as the hottest player in world football and is widely expected to leave the Bundesliga side. Dortmund is prepared to allow the 20-year-old leave for €180 million this summer. Real Madrid and Barcelona have spoken to Haaland’s agent and father in Spain on Thursday, with the Norway international also a target for Manchester United and Chelsea. But Guardiola has claimed City won’t be able to afford the player if he becomes available this summer. “With these prices, we are not going to buy any striker. It is impossible, we cannot afford it. “All the clubs struggle financially and we are not an exception. We have Gabriel [Jesus], Ferran [Torres], a lot of players in the academy, and we sometimes play with a false nine. There are a lot of big chances that we are not going to sign a new striker for next season. “We have enough players in the first team right now and interesting players in the Academy. It is a big challenge, for the situation in the world, because of the economic problems in world football, we are not going to sign any striker for next season,” Guardiola said at a press conference on Friday.
