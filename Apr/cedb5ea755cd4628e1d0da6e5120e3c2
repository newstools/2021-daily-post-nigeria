Akpabio disclosed this in Abuja at the APC National Secretariat when he spoke with journalists on Thursday. “I think most of the problems are politically motivated. “So, we must use our binoculars to be able to look and identify the sponsors of the insecurity we’re witnessing in the country. “What’s happening now is not Nigeria; this is un-Nigeria. “We must do everything possible, even through advice, to make sure that Nigeria remains united,” Akpabio said, adding that it wasn’t time for a blame game. Akpabio noted that the security challenge in the country has already assumed a worrisome dimension as it wasn’t limited to one section of Nigeria.
