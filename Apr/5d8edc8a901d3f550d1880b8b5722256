Former Tottenham Hotspur striker, Darren Bent, has warned Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, that he could be sacked if he fails to win the Europa League this season. The Gunners are struggling to qualify for Europe through the Premier League, as they currently sit ninth place and four points behind Spurs who occupy the last spot. However, they could qualify for the Champions League if they win the Europa League outrightly. “Yes, this season has been really inconsistent. But I don’t want Arsenal to become a club where they keep sacking managers. At some stage you’ve got to give someone a little bit of time. “The FA Cup win papers over a lot of cracks and if Arsenal go out of the Europa League and finish 10th or 11th, I think he could be out of a job,” Bent told talkSPORT.
