Popular rapper, AKA, has broken his silence on the death of his fiancée, Nelli Tembe. Recall that Tembe died weeks ago after she fell from the 10th floor of the Pepper club hotel in Cape Town. AKA in a statement on his official Twitter page said every day since her death, “feels like a mountain to climb.” He appealed for privacy as he is still emotionally down and trying to seek clarity about her death. Part of the statement read: “I miss Anele, and I am heartbroken at the unfulfilled life we had planned together. “Her tragic loss has taken a toll on me emotionally and psychologically. Insinuations and Innuendos made on my personhood have made it even more difficult to process and the strain our families have taken is unspeakable which is why at this time, I choose to retreat to honour my journey, praying that the moment of stillness may bring me closer to some sanity.”
