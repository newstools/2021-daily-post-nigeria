Biafra Nations League, BNL, said it has ordered its members to launch a reprisal attack on Fulani herdsmen following the recent killing of at least 15 people in Ebonyi State. The killings took place Monday night in Nkalaha, Obegu, Amazu, Nkalagu and Umuhuali autonomous communities. At least, 15 persons were reportedly killed during the attack allegedly carried out by some herders. Addressing reporters in Ikom, Cross River State, Deputy National Leader of BNL, and Head of Operations, BBS Media, Ebuta Akor Takon, said, “Enough is enough.” According to them, “We [have] ordered members and supporters of BNL in other parts of the old eastern region to mobilize and launch counter-attacks on them in less than five days. “Any attack from them will surely be avenged until they are stopped by their parents bodies, the Miyetti Allah Kauta Hore and Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association.” BNL queried why soldiers would be after pro-Biafra groups but have done nothing to stop the attacks on villages by alleged Fulani militants.
