A yet-to-be-identified man was confirmed dead on Thursday afternoon in a lone road accident that occurred along Gbongan-Ibadan highway, Osun State. The fatal accident occurred around 12:45 pm on Thursday before Forte Oil filling Station, 2 kilometres from Sasa bridge. The Sector Public Education Officer for Osun Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Agnes Ogungbemi, said the accident, which involved a Ash Toyota Previa, with registration number APM 222 AA was probably caused by speed limit violation. She added that eight others who sustained injuries have been taken to hospitals in Ile-Ife. “Four of the victims were taken to OAU Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife while five victims were taken to Seven days Adventist, hospital Ile-Ife after they were rejected at OAUTH because of lack of bed space. The corpse was deposited at OAUTH morgue,” she said. The Osun State Sector Commander, Kudirat Ibrahim, called on road users to be road conscious always and to obey traffic regulations to avoid being caught in accidents that could lead to loss of lives and property.
