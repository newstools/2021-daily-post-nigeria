The Police Command in Ekiti has rescued two-year-old twin babies locked up in a room by their mother for three days. A statement by Sunday Abutu, the Command’s Public Relations Officer, said the incident happened in Igbara-Odo, Ekiti South-West Local Government Area. Abutu said the command acted on a distress call by a good Samaritan at about 9:45 am on Monday. The Rapid Response Squad (RRS) rushed to the scene and secured the kids. The suspect, identified as Joy Fatoba, is in custody. The PRO said Fatoba disclosed the twins’ father travelled to Calabar during pregnancy and had refused to take care of her and the kids. “She told her interrogator that she could no longer fend for herself and her two kids recently because her hairdressing work started failing.” Abutu noted that the kids could neither walk nor stand on their own due to dehydration and undernutrition. They are currently at the hospital for medical examination and treatment. An investigation is ongoing. The command urged residents to report suspicious happenings in their locality to the nearest station.
