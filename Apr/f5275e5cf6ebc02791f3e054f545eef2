Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, President of the Senate has reaffirmed that Nigeria’s unity remains non-negotiable despite numerous calls by some groups and individuals for the country to disintegrate. DAILY POST reports that during an interview with newsmen in his ancestral home at the official inauguration of NTA Community Station, Gashu’a, Yobe state, the Chief lawmaker assured that Nigeria would continue to be one. He expresses displeasure on how some elites in the country were fueling agitations for the disunity of Nigeria. “When I say that the unity of Nigeria is not negotiable, I mean that Nigeria will continue to be one. “What we need to emphasize always is equity, justice and fairness to all and I believe this is one way to go, probably the only way to go to ensure that everybody feels belonged,” he stated. Lawan explained that real Nigerians who form the majority of the population always believe in the unity of the country. “I believe that, majority of Nigerians believe that they should stay together, especially the real Nigerians; with all due respect when I say the real Nigerians, I mean the ordinary Nigerians. These are people who believe in the unity of this country. “For instance, you can find an Igbo man in the remotest part of Yobe State, because he believes this is his country and can stay in any part of it and make a living. Similarly, you can also find a Hausa man in the remotest part of South-south, may be selling kolanut or something and even married there, because he believes in Nigeria,” he added. The Senate President stressed that what the multitude of Nigerians required was leadership. “We must give them fair leadership,” he stressed. According to him, in the area of equitable distribution of projects, the federal government had done a lot in spreading projects across the country. “You will agree with me that the federal government has not favored any part of the country,” he added.
