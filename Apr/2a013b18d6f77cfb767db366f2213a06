The Police in Ekiti State on Friday confirmed that gunmen have kidnapped Oba David Oyewumi, the Obadu of Ilemeso in Oye Local Government Area (LGA) of the state. The spokesman for the police in Ekiti, ASP Sunday Abutu, confirmed the incident and described it as “unfortunate and regrettable,’’ NAN reports. Abutu explained that the gunmen stormed the traditional ruler’s palace on Thursday and kidnapped him. He said, “Yes, the incident happened yesterday night at the Oba’s palace. We’re already doing everything necessary to rescue him and apprehend the culprits.’’ Sources in Ilemeso told newsmen that the gunmen, numbering about six, scaled the Oba’s fence and fired several shots into the air to scare its occupants. They said the incident happened at about 8.30 p.m on Thursday night when the chiefs who visited the place had left. “After they gained entry, the gunmen asked after the Oba, which showed that they really came for him,’’ one of the sources said. Meanwhile, Ilemeso is a neighbouring town to Isan Ekiti, the country home of Governor Kayode Fayemi. Recall that Oba Adetutu Ajayi, the Elewu of Ewu Ekiti, narrowly escaped kidnapping at Isan Ekiti last week on the Ewu-Ayetoro road.
