Juventus manager, Andrea Pirlo, has reacted to his side’s Serie A 2-1 victory against Napoli on Wednesday night. Pirlo also singled out Paulo Dybala for praise after the Argentine scored a goal against Napoli. Juventus defeated Napoli at the Allianz Stadium, thanks to two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Dybala. “We have dropped lots of points along the way because we have lacked a cutting edge at times, especially in matches which look easier on paper. You can’t afford to do that in a league where all the teams are so well prepared,” Pirlo said at his post-match press conference. “When we play with the spirit we showed today, this desire to win and to put in a shift for the team, that’s when you get results. “We decided to play these tactics – with Danilo as an extra midfielder – to free up more space out wide. We pulled it off well, although we did not always make the most of the extra man on the counter-attack – and when you get those sorts of chances, you have to take them. “As for Dybala, when you have a player like him, you try to play him as much as possible – he raises the level. “We must learn from the mistakes we made as we want to play our last ten matches as best we can and get ready for the Coppa Italia final.”
