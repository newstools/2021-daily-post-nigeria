Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has predicted a ‘tough’ tie when the Blues tackle Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final second-leg tie at Stamford Bridge next week. Tuchel said this following Chelsea’s Champions League semi-final first-leg 1-1 draw with Real Madrid on Tuesday night. First-half goals from Christian Pulisic and Karim Benzema ensured Chelsea and Real Madrid played a draw at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano in Spain. Speaking after the game, Tuchel said at his post-match press conference, “We played a very strong first-half. We should have won the first half. “Unfortunately, we’re a bit unlucky and lacked composure and decision making in the opponent’s box. “Maybe we could have decided this match very, very early in the first half an hour when we’re playing so, so strong. “Next week, we’ve to face another challenge against Real Madrid, it will be another tough one because it’s the Champions League semi-final, nothing is sure.”
