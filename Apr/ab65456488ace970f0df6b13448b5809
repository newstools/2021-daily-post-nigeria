Ibukun Awosika says the dissolution of Nigeria is not an option as the country “is already many decades too late to disintegrate”. The Chairman, First Bank Board of Directors made the remark on Thursday in Kaduna at a Town Hall Meeting on National Security. Awosika noted that those who fought for the independence of Nigeria did not come from the same tribe. The renowned author said Nigeria comprises many tribes, ethnic groups, culture and tradition and the combination, according to her, long provided the opportunity to develop talents, diversity, natural and human resources. “When you look at what Nigeria represents in terms of the size of market and population, the country is richly blessed”, NAN quoted her as saying. Awosika said as a Christian, many of her family members, friends, business associates are Muslims and they live in peace and harmony. She blamed the political leaders for not doing enough and for playing politics with the issue of Nigeria’s break up. Awosika, however, warned that if the politicians succeed in destroying the country, there would be nothing left to govern. The motivational speaker urged the political class to “review the approach of gaining power”.
