A member of the Anambra House of Assembly, Hon Nonso Okafor says it is untrue that Governor Willie Obiano endorsed an aspirant for the party’s ticket in the November governorship election. Okafor, a chieftain of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) stated this yesterday, during an interactive session with journalists at the Godwin Ezeemo Press Centre, Awka. The lawmaker was reacting to insinuations that the governor has endorsed the former Central Bank Governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo for the party’s ticket. Okafor said, “I don’t understand what people mean by body language. People should stop dropping the name of the governor just to sway people into favouring their aspiration. “Anambra is for all of us, and the governor is our governor. Soludo is not the only one who knows the governor, I know the governor too, and I was with him just yesterday and we discussed. “If you know our governor, you will know that he is a very plain person who can tell you his mind, even in public. I’m sure if he had endorsed anyone, he would have said it. He is not the type people will be saying body language, because he would have communicated it.” Reacting to insinuations that he was being sponsored by some billionaires in Nnewi where he comes from to destabilize Soludo’s chances, Okafor said it was natural for him to have followers from his hometown, just as Soludo may have supporters from his Aguata area. “People say I’m challenging Soludo, but I say no, I’m not challenging Soludo. I’m running for the governorship position, just as Soludo is running. But if I find out that Soludo is challenging me, then I will challenge him. “It is wrong to say I’m being sponsored to spoil Soludo’s chances. This is an era where people are yearning for young people like me as leaders, so I can say that it is Soludo who is being sponsored to destabilize my chances,” Okafor said.
