The National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control, NAFDAC, has alerted the public as the US placed all alcohol-based hand sanitisers, manufactured in Mexico on watch list. NAFDAC Director-General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, made this known in a statement released to newsmen in Abuja on Monday, NAN reports. Adeyeye said the move became necessary to help stop product falsification. She further explained that the products will be on the US watch list until the agency is able to certify its safety. “The USFDA had noticed a high increase in hand sanitiser products from Mexico that were labelled to contain ethanol but tested positive for methanol contamination. “Methanol is a substance that can be toxic when absorbed through the skin and life-threatening when ingested. “It is also not an acceptable ingredient in hand sanitiser or other drugs. “Under the import alert, alcohol-based hand sanitisers from Mexico are subject to heightened FDA scrutiny,” she said.
