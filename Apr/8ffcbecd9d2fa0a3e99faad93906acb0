Two suspects, who robbed a POS Shop in Ogidi, under Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi State, have been arrested by the Nigerian Police. They were arrested by the Operatives of Operation Puff Adder II attached to Iyara Division of the State. According to a statement issued on Wednesday by the Kogi State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP William Ovye Aya, three armed men on Tuesday invaded a POS shop at Ogidi, attacked the operator, inflicted injury on him and forcefully collected unspecified amount of money from him.
