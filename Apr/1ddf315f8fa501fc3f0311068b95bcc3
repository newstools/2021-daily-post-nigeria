A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Olisa Agbakoba has written to Nigerian governors on the judiciary workers’ strike. The former President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) urged the governors to observe the rule of law. In a letter to Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti Governor and the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF), Agbakoba cited three cases relating to the demands of the striking staff. “I am saddened by the avoidable strike action by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) because of the stress it has caused the judicial system. A simple way out is for state governors to obey judgments of the court.” Agbakoba pointed out that Sections 81 (3) and 121 (3) of the constitution grants financial autonomy to the Federal and State Judiciaries. “This has been confirmed by courts in the following cases: JUSUN vs National Judiciary Council & Governors – Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/667/13; Olisa Agbakoba vs FG, The NJC & National Assembly – Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/63/2013 and Olisa Agbakoba vs AG, Ekiti State & 2 others – Suit No. NAD/56/2013.” The SAN said President Muhammadu Buhari affirmed the decisions of the courts by issuing Executive Order 10 of 2020, in the exercise of his powers under Section 5 of the constitution. Agbakoba appealed to governors to enforce the decisions of the court and “save the country the chaos”. He added that JUSUN is correct to pursue a policy of financial independence of the courts as guaranteed by the constitution and affirmed by three decisions of superior courts.
