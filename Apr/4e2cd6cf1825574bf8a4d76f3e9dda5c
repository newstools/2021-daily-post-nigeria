As the strike embarked upon by the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria and Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) has grounded the two arms of government, a member of the House of Representatives , Hon. Omowumi Ogunlola, has appealed to executive to always treat the judiciary and legislature as partners. Specifically, Ogunlola advised the State Governors to work harmoniously with the judiciary and legislature to develop the country’s democracy, rather than seeing them as appendages of the executive arm. The All Progressives Congress lawmaker, who is representing Ekiti West/ Efon/ Ijero Federal constituency, spoke in Ijero Ekiti, Ijero Local Government area, on Saturday. Lamenting the total closure of the judicial and legislative arms across the nation, Ogunlola said: “The constitution is very explicit that there are three arms of government, though interrelated, with classified and established functions to the extent that there shouldn’t be encroachment. “But it is regrettable that anything goes in Nigeria, because of our penchant for illegalities. When it comes to the issues of proper applications of the laws, custodians of the laws will distance themselves or keep silent. The unfortunate thing now is that our laws are no longer respected. “My advice to the executives is that, they should not see the Judiciary and Legislature as appendages, but as partners. The National Assembly is preparing for a review of our laws and we are going to review this and spell out the functions of all the arms to show how real governance should be,” Ogunlola stated. The Secretary to the State Government, Hon. Biodun Oyebanji, described the lawmaker as a worthy representative of the people, who has not disappointed her constituents. Oyebanji assured that all the developmental projects being executed in Ijero Local government by Governor Kayode Fayemi would continue, applauding the lawmaker for not neglecting any town in the federal constituency.
