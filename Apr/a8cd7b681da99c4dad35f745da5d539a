There is protest ongoing at the Plateau State University, Bokkos, following the raping of four female students of the University, on Monday night. The students who are residing off campus were said to have been abducted by unknown gunmen, raped and dumped in the bush, late Monday night. The peaceful protest is said to have stalled academic activities in the institution. DAILY POST gathered from a source that a male student residing in the area was also shot, and was left injured. The source also said the act by the unknown gunmen is becoming a recurring issue. “This is becoming a worrying issue, because more than 90% of the students of the institution reside off campus, because of lack of enough hostel accommodation in the school”, the source decried. DAILY POST also recalls that on Sunday 9th June, 2019, suspected herdsmen invaded one of the female hostels of the institution and raped a female student and left her unconscious. Also in an attempt to intervene, a 100 level student of Geography Department, Mr. Ugu Sheni Kimati was killed. However, when contacted, Spokesman of the Plateau State Police Command, ASP Gabriel Ogaba, said,
“There was an incident where unknown persons invaded a student logde off campus in Bokkos. “They only made away with their phones as a result of the quick response of our personnel.” According to him, “No student was raped”. The Police Public Relations Officer assured that investigation was ongoing to unravel the perpetrators.
