Former Manchester United midfielder, Paul Scholes, has said that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men were “lucky” to be awarded a late penalty during their Europa League quarter-final first-leg 2-0 win against Granada on Thursday in Spain. Man United looked like they were going to take a 1-0 lead back to Old Trafford when they were awarded a 90th minute penalty. Granada’s Yan Eteki was judged by the referee to have blocked Bruno Fernandes, who then converted the penalty. Marcus Rashford had scored for the Red Devils in the first half. But Scholes believes Fernandes “fooled” the referee to get the penalty. “He makes a meal of it. I think he’s lucky to get the penalty. Lucky to score it as well as the goalkeeper should do better,” Scholes told BT Sport. “You know what it’s given, and it goes to VAR. They are going to give it because it’s not a clear and obvious error, and he has touched him, so there’s no way they were going to overturn it. “Fernandes does very well to get the penalty, they will be very disappointed. He was just feeling where his player is, and the ball is nowhere near him anyway.” “It was always Cavani going to get the header. Fernandes was very clever, and he fooled the referee, and he fell for it.” Man United will face Granada in the return leg next Thursday in England.
