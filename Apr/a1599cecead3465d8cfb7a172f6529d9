A pressure group, Igbo National Council Worldwide (INC) rooted in sensitizing the Igbo-speaking states in the struggle for freedom, has demanded for an immediate disbandment of the newly-launched southeast security outfit known as ‘Ebubeagu’. The group said that the said security outfit is ‘pro-Fulani’ agenda hatched by the southeast governors for their selfish interest. Chilos Godsent, who is the President of the group, in a statement issued on Monday, expressed dismay at the resolution of the southeast governors, accusing them of sabotaging the gallant and courageous activities of many community vigilantes and some pro-Igbo self-determination groups which are working assiduously in defense of the fatherland. He urged the governors to wake up from slumber and stand on the side of the masses or be condemned forever by posterity. According to him, “The southeast governors have shown the height of their cowardice by readily giving in to such a self-destructive idea. “From time immemorial, the eastern Nigeria has never been characterized with act of terrorism and banditry till the rise of the Fulani’s regime since 2015 till date. “The administration has made conscious efforts to annihilate the people and take over their land and convert the weaker captives to Islams, but we must resist this with the last drop of our blood. “We, therefore, urge the governors of the Southeast zone to swallow their pride and heed to the voice of the majority of the people that they took oath to protect. “Similarly, we call for the immediate disbandment of the Ebubeagu security outfit and appeal that a new process be adopted to unanimously establish an indigenous South East Security Outfit that will be independent from the Fulani control.”
