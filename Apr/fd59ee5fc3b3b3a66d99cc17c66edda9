FIFA President, Gianni Infantino, has warned the 12 clubs that have signed up for the Super League, to expect “consequences” for their actions. The world governing body has explained that clubs “cannot be half in or half out”. “At FIFA, we can only strongly disapprove the creation of a Super League which is a closed shop, which is a breakaway from the current institutions, from the leagues, from the associations, from UEFA, and FIFA,” Infantino said at the UEFA Congress. He added: “If some elect to go their own way, then they must live with the consequences of their choice. They are responsible for their choice. “This means either you are in or you are out. You cannot be half in or half out.” Real Madrid President, Florentino Perez, has said all the 12 clubs signed a “binding” contract last Saturday.
