There was a heated conversation between Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, and referee Gil Manzano during the El Clasico on Saturday. During the argument, the Argentina international, who was on the losing side had asked the referee to speak to him with respect, according to Tribuna. This led the referee to ask the Argentine captain if he (Messi) really understand the rule of football and offered to tutor later. Real Madrid defeated Barcelona and climbed above Atletico Madrid on the La Liga table on goal difference and a point ahead of the Catalans. The Barca captain was heard telling Manzano: “Speak well, referee, with respect!” Manzano replied: “Do you know the rules of football or not? If you don’t, then I’ll explain them to you later.”
