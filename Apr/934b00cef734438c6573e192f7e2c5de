The Nigeria Medical Association, NMA, has expressed appreciation to the Governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu, for his renewed commitment and promises to residency training at Abia State University Teaching Hospital, ABSUTH. This was made known by the NMA chairman in the State, Dr Chimezie Okwuonu, during a joint press conference on the issue of the ongoing nationwide strike by Resident Doctors, held in Umuahia. According to the Medical body, “We appreciate his Excellency the Executive Governor of Abia State, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu for accepting to study the Medical Residency Training Act of 2017 with appropriate funding for possible domestication in Abia State within twenty days. “We laud his resolve to ensure prompt payment of monthly salary to our members, his acknowledgement of owing our members in ABSUTH salary arrears, and as well as, his promise to release about eighty million naira (N80,000,000.00) for the re-accreditation of residency training programme at ABSUTH within ten (10) days”. He reiterated the commitment of the NMA to synergize with the State government in the area of quality health care delivery in the state. Governor Ikpeazu had said that his administration would provide the needed funds for the accreditation of Departments at the Abia State University Teaching Hospital (ABSUTH), study the Act of the National Association of Resident Doctors for domestication, as well as maintain regular payment of salaries of Resident Doctors in the State. Governor Ikpeazu, who disclosed this at the weekend while receiving a delegation of the national body of resident doctors at his Aba Lodge, explained that despite the fact that the issue of salary arrears predated his administration, he was determined to tackle it.
