Former Ekiti Governor Ayo Fayose has conceded the South-West leadership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde. He made the declaration on Monday during the South-West Zonal Congress at the Women and Children Development Initiative Foundation (WOCDIF), Osogbo, Osun State. Speaking in English and Yoruba, Fayose said “Nothing will last forever. And if I have offended anybody, I apologize. “Don’t allow them to give us a name that’s not ours in Yorubaland. The time of our Governor, Seyi Makinde, will not fail. Fayose further used a proverb to describe what went wrong. He said “Ija l’ode t’orin d’owe”. Meaning: “It was the fight that occurred that made a song become a proverb”. “Seyi Makinde and I are one since. But under any leadership regardless of the level, you are our father. God will help you to succeed.” In his remarks, Makinde assured that he would work with the new zonal officials to reposition the party. The Oyo helmsman said at the end of the exercise, there will be no victor, no vanquished. He reiterated that the success of the PDP zonal congress had far-reaching implications for the PDP nationally. Governor Samuel Ortom, Chairman of the Congress Electoral/Congress Committee, was represented by his Deputy, Benson Abounu.
