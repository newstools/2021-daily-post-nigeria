Paul Ince has blamed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for Manchester United’s 0-0 draw with Leeds United in the Premier League on Sunday. The league game at Elland Road on Sunday afternoon ended goalless with few clear-cut chances. Man United boss, Solskjaer only introduced Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani and Donny van de Beek very late in the game and Ince questions the timing of Solskjaer’s changes. He also wondered why the Norwegian tactician withdrew Marcus Rashford with his side chasing a goal. “Cavani comes on for six minutes. Six minutes when you need a goal? Ince told Sky Sports. “You take Rashford off when you got two sitting midfielders in Fred and McTominay. Van de Beek who they paid £40m for, gets three minutes. “These decisions aren’t right if you are trying to win a football match. Man United have always been bought up on winning games. “You have to find a way to win the game and taking Rashford off and giving Cavani six minutes for me isn’t a way to win the game. “This for me was an opportunity for Man United and for me they didn’t take it.”
