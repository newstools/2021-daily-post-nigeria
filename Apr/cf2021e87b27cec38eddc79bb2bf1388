The Rivers State police command has confirmed reports of a cult clash which led to the death of three persons in Diobu area of Port Harcourt, the state capital. The incident which took place on Thursday had created panic in the area and had caused a heavy gridlock after suspected cultists shot sporadically. Confirming the cult clash in a statement, the Police Public Relations Officer of the state police command, Nnamdi Omoni, said his men from the Diobu division responded to a distress call and mobilized massively to the scene to quell the situation. Omoni, however, said the suspected cultists took to their heels before the arrival of police operatives, leaving three lifeless bodies. He, however, confirmed that the police officers were able to arrest one suspect identified as Paul Ejike who he said is helping in the investigation. Part of the statement read “I confirm that there was a gang clash between two rival cult groups today 22/4/2021 at about 1500hrs, where it was reported that unknown gunmen were shooting sporadically at the Railway axis of Diobu”. “On the receipt of the distress call, operatives of the Diobu Division mobilized massively to the scene but unfortunately on arrival, the cultists had taken to flight. They, however, were able to arrest one of them alive, while three lifeless bodies were at the scene with multiple gunshot wounds on their bodies. The bodies were confirmed dead on arrival at the hospital and were deposited in the Mortuary”. In the meantime, calm has so far returned to the area following increased police patrol. The police spokesman enjoined the public to go about their lawful activities without fear of molestation, stressing that the Commissioner of Police, CP Eboka Friday has vowed to deal decisively with all criminal elements in the State.
