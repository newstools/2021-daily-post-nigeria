A former England winger, John Barnes, has predicted the positions Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool will finish in the Premier League table this season. Man United currently sit in the second position in the Premier League table with 14 points behind leaders Manchester City. Chelsea are fifth with a point adrift of the top four, while Liverpool are in seventh place. Providing his predictions, Barnes was quoted by Metro as saying: “I think that Liverpool will finish fourth. “First and second place between Manchester City and Manchester United is decided. “Leicester have a cushion but could easily lose a couple of matches even though they are playing consistently well. “So fourth place is up for grabs and I think it is between Chelsea and Liverpool. “Tottenham, Everton and West Ham are also there, but I think Liverpool will finish fourth. “Once [Virgil] van Dijk comes back, Liverpool will be competing for titles again, if he, [Joe] Gomez and [Joel] Matip had all been fit, then Liverpool would be competing with Manchester City this season. “That for me is the sole reason why they are not there. “Next season, if these players come back and Liverpool add one or two signings, then they will challenge again and much closer to the top than they have been this season.”
