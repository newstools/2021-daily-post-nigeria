A chieftain of Alliance for Democracy (AD) in Oyo State, Engineer Oyedele Hakeem Alao has said religious bias and bigotry are the major causes of insecurity in the country. Alao made this known in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Saturday to felicitate Christians on this year’s Easter celebrations. Alao, who contested the gubernatorial election on the platform of AD in 2019 in Oyo State, urged Nigerians to reject religious bias and bigotry to have peace in the country. He maintained that religious bias and bigotry should be rejected by all Nigerians so that we can have peace in the land. In the statement issued by his Media Aide, Omotayo Iyanda, Alao also urged Nigerians to accommodate each other. “Religious bias and bigotry should be rejected by all of us so we can have peace in the land. “As Easter also commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the defeat of death and the hope of salvation, all of us, Christians, Muslims and other religious sects must see ourselves as one body to fight for a common cause of ensuring that we all live comfortably and in peace. “This is an awareness that a religious festival like Easter must create in our minds. “It is only when we are aware of this fact that the death of Christ, his pains and resurrection will not be in vain. “Alao urged everybody in Nigeria, Oyo State in particular, to accommodate each other as love remains the centre of the message of Christ to all of us on the surface of the earth. “The AD candidate in the 2019 gubernatorial election in Oyo State said he believed the essence of the existence of Christ on earth, his teachings, preachings and messages emphasises love, which could be expressed by accommodating one another regardless of our differences. “We wish all our Christian political leaders, fathers, mothers, political leaders, uncles, aunts, brothers and sisters a happy 2021 Easter celebration.”
