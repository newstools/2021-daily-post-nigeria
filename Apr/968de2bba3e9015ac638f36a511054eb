Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has predicted the winner of this year’s UEFA Champions League. The Englishman is backing Ligue1 giants, Paris Saint-Germain to go on to win the trophy this season. PSG were defeated in last season’s final by German Bundesliga giants, Bayern Munich and Ferdinand believes they can end their long wait for Champions League glory under new boss, Mauricio Pochettino. The French Champions knocked out Barcelona and holders Bayern Munich to reach the last four of the competition and face Manchester City in the semi-final first leg on Wednesday. Ferdinand is confident PSG have the ‘experience’ and the attacking talent to see off City and go all the way after learning from the mistakes they have made in recent years. “I think Paris Saint-Germain will win it,” the former England defender predicted on his Rio Ferdinand Presents FIVE YouTube channel. “They have the experience of last season, two strikers, the business end of the season they know what it’s about now. “They’ve been here together, they’re not fazed and I think they’ll have the experience. Pochettino comes up smelling of roses after a turbulent couple of years. “I don’t think they’ll care [if he doesn’t win the league]. If he wins the Champions League then he’s outdone everyone because that’s what they are here for. “Don’t forget, he’s only come in halfway through the season. His fingerprints ain’t all over that league.”
