Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said the on-field clash between Harry Maguire and Fred during the 0-0 draw against Leeds United, came from his players demanding the best from each other. The two players could be heard throwing expletives at each other during the second half at Elland Road. From the stands, it sounded as though Maguire used the F word on Fred. Speaking after the game, Solskjaer insisted it was all part of the mentality of his players, who always strive for the best. He said: “We have got a group that demands a lot of each other. The standard is high, both on training and in a game, it is not just about being a nice guy. “We demand maximum effort. I was really proud of how strong we looked. I never thought they threatened our goal in the second half but we missed a little bit of spark to win the game.”
