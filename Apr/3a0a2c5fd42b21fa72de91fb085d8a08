Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has blasted midfielder, Fred, for his part in AS Roma’s second goal during the Red Devils’ UEFA Europa League, UEL, 6-2 win at Old Trafford on Thursday night. Scholes said Fred contributed nothing for Man United against Roma, adding that the Brazilian was ‘left wanting’ in the win over the Italian Serie A side. Man United defeated Roma in the Europa League semi-final first-leg tie at home, thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes, Edinson (2), Cavani (2), Paul Pogba and Mason Greenwood. “That is what Fred is in the team for, he’s in the team to stop this type of thing,” Scholes told BT Sport when analysing Roma’s second goal. “From their best midfield player, he gets in behind them [Man United’s defence]. “Fred… please stop that. He contributes nothing going forward, and his absolute job is to stop that type of thing. And he’s been left wanting again.” Man United will face Liverpool in their next fixture in the Premier League on Sunday.
