The former governor of Akwa Ibom State and minister, Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio has told residents that the development and infrastructural renaissance of the state remain in their hands. Akpabio stated this on Wednesday during the inauguration of the Akwa Ibom Democratic Forum (ADF) in Eket and Uyo Senatorial Districts. He said the Forum was apolitical, not an appendage of any political party or person, but an amalgam of people who are yearning and craving for dependable and efficient leadership in the state. His words, “The urban dualization of Eket is in your hands, the dualized road that will link the entire Eket Senatorial District which produces all the crude oil is in your hands. We did our best but we couldn’t do everything. The posterity of our people is in your hands. The empowerment of our children is in your hands. The life and death of Akwa Ibom State are in your hands”. He added, “ADF does not stand for any political party. It stands for people who are craving dependable leadership. It stands for people who are yearning for Inter-Ministerial Direct Labour jobs so that they can improve their lives. It stands for people who will change boys to men and girls to women. It stands for people who will turn Akwa Ibom back to a destination. Throwing more light on the mission of the forum, Director-General Obongemem Ekperikpe Ekpo said three of them approached Senator Akpabio in Abuja on the need for a platform to galvanize support for dependable leadership which he represents across all political linings in the state as a vehicle of bringing together his supporters and lovers of good governance which Akpabio accepted.
