The Police in Kebbi State have confirmed the killing of a Divisional Police Officer (DPO), eight other policemen and two Yan Sa-Kai operatives (vigilantes) by bandits. They all died during a gun fight in Sakaba Local Government Areas on Sunday. Public Relations Officer, DSP Nafi’u Abubakar told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the incident occurred around 14:30 hours. The bandits hit Dankolo, Sakaba, Makuku, Dokar Kambari and Kurmin Hodo villages of Sakaba LGA. The attackers too were said to have suffered casualties. A resident, Salisu Adamu said: “They killed DPO Jimoh Abdullahi, policemen and two ’Yan sa Kais’. Please we need your prayers. They killed seven people in Inana village alone.” He disclosed the assailants carted away thousands of cattle from Dankolo, Sakaba, Makuku, Dokar Kambari and Kurmin Hodo villages. “They started shooting sporadically which prompted the village people to flee for safety in different directions.” Husseini Bala, another resident of Dirin Daji, confirmed the policemen went missing after the attack.
