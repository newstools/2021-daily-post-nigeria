Some gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have hijacked an 18-seater passenger commercial bus in Ibarapa, Oyo State. DAILY POST gathered that the bus was hijacked along the Igboora/Eruwa Road on Thursday. The bus which was heading to Eruwa was reportedly hijacked and all the passengers matched to an unknown destination at gunpoint. DAILY POST gathered from a family of one of the victims that the gunmen demanded the sum of ten million naira for the release of each of the victims. The source said, “Yes. The 18 people were kidnapped this morning. Seven persons yesterday, 18 today.” Another source who spoke to DAILY POST on Thursday said kidnappers have continued to have their way despite the heavy security presence in the zone. The source confirmed that seven people were also kidnapped around 5pm on Wednesday. “The rate of kidnappings in Ibarapa in the last few weeks have become worrisome. Yesterday at 5.00pm, 7 persons who were on their way to Eruwa had their vehicle stopped on the bridge and were whisked away into the kidnapper’s vehicle. This has taken a new dimension. I am greatly disturbed. “The police are back on the road extorting money from drivers. With their presence, nothing has changed. Should we say their presence has brought the resurgence of kidnappings in the region. “They were busy extorting money which is very important to them, while kidnappers are free to do their nefarious act. God dey “Two weeks ago, 2 students were kidnapped. The parents paid 1.2M before their release. The commercial vehicle conveying the students was stooped midway. The poor state of the road has added injury to the scenario. Where do we go from here.” However, all efforts made by DAILY POST to get a reaction from the Public Relations Officer of the State Police Command Mr Adewale Osifeso proved abortive. Calls put through to his mobile phone were not answered while an SMS sent to him for a reaction has not been replied as at the time of filing this report on Thursday.
