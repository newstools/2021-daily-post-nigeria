The Nigerian government has denied allegations made by the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, that it printed N60billion to support March allocation to states. The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, disclosed this on Wednesday. Ahmed described the allegation by Obaseki as untrue and sad. Obaseki had said: “When we got FAAC (Federal Account Allocation Committee) for March, the government printed additional N50-N60 billion to top-up for us to share. “This April, we will go to Abuja and share. At the end of this year, our total borrowings is going to be within N15-N16 trillion.” However, Ahmed insists Nigeria’s debt is still within sustainable limit and efforts are on to improve revenue generation capacity. “The issue that was raised by the Edo State Governor is very, very sad. Because it is not fact. “What we distribute at FAAC is revenue that is generated and in fact distribution revenue is public information. We publish revenue generated by FIRS, the customs and the NNPC and we distribute at FAAC. “So, it is not true to say we printed money to distribute at FAAC, it is not true,” she said.
