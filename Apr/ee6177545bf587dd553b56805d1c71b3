The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru says his predecessors are in a better position to provide details of arms funds approved by the federal government. During a meeting with the House of Representatives Adhoc Committee on Arms and Ammunition Purchase, Attahiru was asked to explain the contents of the Executive Summary on contracts executed by the Nigerian Army. The committee chaired by Hon. Olaide Akinremi is reviewing the purchase, use, and control of arms, ammunition, and related hardware by the military, paramilitary, and other law enforcement agencies. The COAS told them he could not do so because he did not personally authorize or award any contract. “The period for which you wanted this report, having been summarized in the Executive Summary, explains whatever details you will require.” Attahiru said the issues of procurement the legislature demanded answers for, “were done by specific individuals”. He advised the lawmakers to invite them to clarify issues raised and to provide adequate answers. On his inability to honour previous invitations, the Army chief said: “I was either in the North East, South East or South-South trying to ensure stability within Nigeria.”
