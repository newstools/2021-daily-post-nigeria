Former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, has condemned the violent attacks in many states of Nigeria. In a statement on Thursday, the All Progressives Congress (APC) leader said he was “angered and troubled”. He decried the terror and cruelty being visited upon the people of Borno, Yobe, Benue, Niger, Imo and other parts of the nation. Tinubu observed the attacks have caused many to disparage the Nigerian military and security forces. He regretted that valiant men and women serve in our security forces, risking their lives to protect us, were being targeted. “We stand with them. Government also must continue to encourage the security forces to do their utmost to subdue this threat. The lives of innocent Nigerians and the future progress of the nation may lie in the balance.” Tinubu told Nigerians not to surrender to the fearful temptation to blame one another. He said regardless of region or religion, the people must unite against a common foe. He added that the enemy’s attacks seem to focus on schools, religious institutions and security forces in order to extinguish the light of knowledge and hope. The politician charged Nigerians not to tremble, adding that tolerance, justice and compassion shall win the day.
