Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta has insisted that Bernd Leno is the club’s number one goalkeeper despite his mistake that led to his side 1-0 defeat to Everton in the Premier League on Friday The Spaniard insisted that mistakes are just a part of football. Richarlison’s tame cross was fumbled into the net by Leno in the 76th minute as the Gunners suffered their ninth home defeat and 13th in all, in the Premier League this season. Asked about his goalkeeping situation and whether he had spoken to Leno following his mistake, Arteta said, “No. I think we have two really good goalkeepers. “Mat [Ryan] got a chance [against Fulham] because he deserves it. I said before the game that he’d been training really really well and Bernd is our number one keeper and he’s been doing well and errors are part of football. “I said that we lost the game for different reasons. One, for things that we can do better and we should do better and the other one that we cannot control. “Again, that error, I make many mistakes and everybody that is involved in any sport will make mistakes and it’s part of it, unfortunately.”
