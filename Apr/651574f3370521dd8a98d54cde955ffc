Members of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors, NARD, have commenced a nationwide strike despite the Federal Government’s efforts to stop the action. NARD gave the explanation on Thursday in a message posted on the association’s Twitter account, @nard_nigeria. It reads, “Nigerians must understand that we love them and the strike is not intended to hurt them but to challenge the Nigerian government @MBuhari @Fmohnigeria @LabourMinNG whose responsibilities amongst others is to care for her citizens and labour force to do the needful. NARD had said a few days ago that it would embark on an indefinite strike beginning from April 1 if the Federal Government failed to meet its demands. The doctors’ grievances include the non-payment of salaries of between three to five months to some house officers and the non-recruitment of house officers. DAILY POST recalls that the strike is happening at a time when President Muhammadu Buhari is in London for a medical check-up.
