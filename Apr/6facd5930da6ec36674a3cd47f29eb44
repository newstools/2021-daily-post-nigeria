The Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, has reacted to the burning of his country home in Orlu East Local Government of the state. Uzodinma said preliminary investigation into the attack indicated that the incident may have been politically-motivated. The governor said the attackers were hoodlums who invaded the property in a motorcade of three vehicles and accompanied by a lorry with tyres used in setting the building ablaze. DAILY POST reports that unknown gunmen on Saturday attacked Uzodinma’s residence and two people were reportedly killed. Reacting to the incident, the governor disclosed that vigilantes around repelled the arsonists. Uzodinma also urged security agencies to ensure that those behind the incident are arrested. He stated this through the state’s Commissioner for information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba. A statement by Emelumba reads partly: “Gallant security operatives this morning repelled an attack on the Omuma country home of the governor of Imo State, Sen Hope Uzodimma. “However, vigilant security operatives attached to the Governor’s house successfully repelled the attack and consequently minimised the damage they had planned to unleash. “In the crossfire that ensued a few casualties were recorded. Preliminary investigation suggests that the foiled attack may have been politically sponsored “The government has directed the relevant security agencies to expedite investigation on the incident and promptly apprehend the sponsors and their agents and bring them to justice.”
