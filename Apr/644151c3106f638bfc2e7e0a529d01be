A former governorship aspirant and Nigerian film producer, Tonye Princewill has revalidated his membership of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in his ancestral home, Buguma, in Rivers State. The Prince of Kalabari Kingdom who participated in the exercise on Wednesday urged members of the party who were yet to revalidate their membership to endeavour to do so. While addressing party members shortly after the exercise, the Prince who was received by a large crowd at the venue, expressed optimism that the party would bounce back in the state. “Our dear party, in the state has been through trying times in recent years, but I’m thankful for the recent victory at the Supreme Court and the opportunity to heal our wounds, strengthen our bonds and move ahead as one unifying force for good governance and social transformation. “I thank everyone who stood by us and revalidated their membership, you are the true world changers. To everyone yet to revalidate or newly register with the APC, I urge you to quickly do so now. Nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. Together we will make a change”, he said. When asked if he was nursing the ambition of running for any office in 2023, he said, “Anyone who loves the party and Rivers state will put politics to one side. It is far too early.” The Prince subsequently paid a visit to an old woman who was said to have been ill for a while.
