Youths in Shiroro Local Government of Niger State have pleaded with the Joint Security Task Force, JSTF, stationed at Allawa and Basaa towns of the council not to withdraw the services of their personnel. They claimed that withdrawal of the security officers would leave the communities vulnerable to the bandits who have become more daring as the days goes by. The withdrawal may not be unconnected to the death of five army officers, one Civil Defence officer and one vigilante yesterday in Allawa community, when armed bandits attacked the camp of the Security Task Force. According to them, leaving the area would lead to more deadly attacks as the people would be at the mercy of the criminals. In a press statement by the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Jubrin Allawa, said, “this is an unhealthy decision equivalent to government ceading the entire land constituting eight political Ward to this miscreants (Bandits). “We have been left at the mercy of the bandits therefore Lakpma Youths Assembly will go to any length to fight for the right of its people,” he stated. However, while sympathising with the military and other security agencies for the loss of their personnel, Jibrin Allawa begged President Muhammadu Buhari and other relevant authorities to rescind their decision to save the lives of the poor and law-abiding citizens of Lakpma and the entire Shiroro community.
