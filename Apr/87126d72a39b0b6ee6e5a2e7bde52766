Former Tottenham star, Rafael van der Vaart, has urged striker, Harry Kane, to reject a move to Real Madrid and join Manchester United. Kane has established himself as one of the top strikers in Europe since joining in recent years, scoring 215 goals in 327 games for Jose Mourinho’s side. The England international, who is yet to win silverware in his career, has drawn the interest of Man United and Real Madrid in the past. But Van der Vaart believes the 27-year-old should join Man United instead, adding that he may not succeed at Real Madrid. “He (Harry Kane) is right, although, of course, he is the man at Tottenham,” said Van der Vaart as quoted by Metro UK. “It may sound crazy, but you would almost say go to Manchester United or something, stay in England. “Usually, it’s not such a success when an English player goes to Madrid.”
