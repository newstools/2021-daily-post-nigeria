Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, has taken steps to pull the club out of the proposed European Super League. Forbes reports that Abramovich has taken the decision based on the negative global reaction about the breakaway competition. On Monday Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham, joined AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid in committing to the plans. However, it was widely rumoured that Chelsea were one of two Premier League clubs who had agreed reluctantly. A source at the club said: “The club is preparing to pull out. “Roman’s involvement with the club has never been about money, it has always been about the community and [the] fans. This is not what we want.”
