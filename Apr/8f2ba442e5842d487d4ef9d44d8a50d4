The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday passed a vote of confidence on President Muhammadu Buhari. The decision was taken at the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) 9th meeting at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja. John Akpan Udoedehe, CECPC Secretary, announced the deliberations and resolutions in a statement. The meeting discussed the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Area Council Elections, CECPC activities in the last quarter, the ongoing membership registration, revalidation and update exercise and the insecurity in Nigeria. The scribe said the CECPC resolved to commend Buhari “for the counteractions taken against the spate of insecurity in some parts of the country and pass a vote of confidence on him.” The APC urged leaders at all levels to show restraint “in comments that do not unite the country in the face of insecurity”. A Registration Appeal Committee will be set up to consider complaints that may arise from members on the conduct of the membership registration, revalidation and update exercise. The committee members expressed satisfaction with the CECPC Chairman and Yobe Governor, Mai Mala Buni for his “peaceful mien and dexterity”.
