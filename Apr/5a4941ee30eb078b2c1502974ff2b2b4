Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, has reacted to reports claiming the United States allegedly placed him on a ‘terror watch list’ for alleged ties with the late Boko Haram founder, Mohammed Yusuf. Reports had emerged on Sunday that Pantami was on the US list over alleged ties with slain Boko Haram leader. The report claimed that the minister was said to be a close confidant of the late Mohammed Yusuf, the killed leader of Boko Haram. It also claimed that Pantami had ties with Abu Quata­da al Falasimi and other Al-Qaeda leaders whom he revered and spoke highly of. Reacting, Pantami in a tweet dismissed the claims describing the report as fake. He further revealed that he has been involved in various debates that preached against insurgency which had, in turn, endangered his life. “My lectures against the doctrines and all other evil people have been available for over 15 years, including debates that endangered my life against many criminals in Nigeria. “If you can’t understand Hausa, get an objective Hausa speaker to translate for you objectively,” he said.
