Plank sellers at the popular Bodija plank market in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital have recounted their losses, saying property worth over two hundred million Naira (N200M) have been destroyed as a result of the fire incident that ravaged some shops in the market. DAILY POST gathered that fire gutted the Zone 7 of the Bodija plank market Monday night. The plank sellers at the market have, however, disclosed that they lost over two hundred million naira as a result of the incident. It was gathered during a visit to the market by DAILY POST correspondent that about eighteen shops and forty people were affected. Chairman of Zone 7 where the incident occurred, Alhaji Daud Owoyemi Ogunrin told DAILY POST that no one could explain the cause of the incident. Ogunrin said, “I was informed some minutes after 8 pm yesterday that our shops were on fire. We came here and everything have been destroyed. “We cannot say the cause of the incident, but eighteen shops have been destroyed. We have more than forty people who have property here. “We are begging God to replenish us. We are calling on well-spirited Nigerians and the government to assist us. We do not know where to start.” Chairman of Ibadan Plank Sellers Association, Elder Gbenga Gbaroye who also spoke with DAILY POST appealed to the government to support the victims. He said, “We call on Oyo State government to assist us because our work needs money. Our work do not require any other thing apart from money. “Over one hundred million naira have been lost here. Where do we start?”
