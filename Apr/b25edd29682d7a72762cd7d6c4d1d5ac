The Acting Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, has promised to provide professional and responsible leadership. Baba spoke on Wednesday after Vice President Yemi Osinbajo decorated him with his new rank. Baba said he was aware of Nigeria’s demand for a secured country. He expressed readiness to work with citizens in the interest of community safety and national security. Baba admitted that Nigeria was experiencing an increasingly complex and pervasive security threat. Noting that terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, and other organised crimes were major challenges, the IGP vowed renewed vigour to address the threats. Baba declared that the Nigeria Police was endowed with some of the finest, courageous and patriotic officers. “I am also encouraged by the fact that the outgoing IG laid a solid foundation and entrenched a culture of professionalism and efficiency. “This will stimulate me to strengthen our strategies to our operational approach to the current security threats”, he said.
