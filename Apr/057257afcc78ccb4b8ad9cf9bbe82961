Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, has advised Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel, to sign Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero, to replace Timo Werner. Aguero will end his 10-year stay at the Etihad this summer and he is believed to be keen on remaining in the Premier League. Merson believes Aguero “ticks the box” for Tuchel’s Chelsea and says the 32-year-old can replace the struggling Werner. He told Sky Sports: “He [Sergio Aguero] ticks the box for me and the way Chelsea play – Chelsea are dominant in football matches, they dictate games and have a lot of possession, they play neat and tidy football around the box and they are looking for that little ball. While Merson doubts Werner will come good at Chelsea, he believes the club should be patient with fellow summer signing Kai Havertz, who he says could develop into a ‘superstar’. He added: “I said Kai Havertz would be a player, a young lad who has arrived with a big price tag and with everything that is going on in the world, he had “long Covid” and that affected him. “But when you watched him the other day, he is a class act, he is proper, I really think he will be a superstar and in time to come, he will be special. “I’m not sure about Werner, though, I don’t it’s working.”
