The Minister of State for Labour and Productivity Festus Keyamo has advised aggrieved parties in the Olu of Warri succession crisis to accept the process or go to court. Crisis continues to trail the emergence of Omoba Tsola Emiko as the Olu of Warri designate for the over 400years old stool. Chief Ayiri Emami, the Ologbotsere (Prime Minister) who led the Advisory Council that disqualified Emiko had been suspended. Keyamo in a congratulatory message released his Senior Special Assistant on Legal and Community Affairs, M. E. Ukusare on Thursday urged all the parties involved to shun violence. According to reports, two Crowns are allegedly missing at the palace as the Coronation is already fixed for July. Ogiame Ikenwoli, the late Olu of Warri, passed away on Monday. “As one of the leaders of the Bar and a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, I advise those aggrieved to either accept the decision in good faith in the overall interest of the Itsekiri Kingdom and Delta State or have recourse to due process and legal avenues in ventilating their dissent. A resort to violence cannot be an option,” the statement reads in part. Keyamo who is also from Delta state prayed for “hitch-free coronation ceremonies whilst praying for God’s guidance and a successful reign on the exalted throne.”
