The Ondo State Governorship Election Tribunal has rescheduled judgement in the petition filed by candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Eyitayo Jegede, against the victory of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the October 10, 2020 governorship election for today, Tuesday, April 20, 2021. The judgment, DAILY POST gathered will be virtual. The Tribunal had last week announced that the judgment had been fixed for Wednesday, April 21 before it was later fixed for today. According to some of the counsels in the case who craved anonymity, the notice of judgement was sent to them on Monday evening. They maintained that the reason for the virtual judgment was due to the ongoing strike by the judicial workers. Jegede is asking the tribunal to declare him winner of the October 10, 2020 governorship election in the State, which saw Akeredolu returning for a second term. According to Jegede in his petition, Akeredolu and his Deputy, Lucky Ayedatiwa were not validly nominated by the APC.
