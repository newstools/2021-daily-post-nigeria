Lionel Messi’s father and agent, Jorge, on Sunday arrived in Barcelona from Argentina, ESPN reports. It is understood that Messi Sr. plans to fly to Italy this week to handle some “personal issues” and that no talks have yet been scheduled with Barca. A meeting with new Barcelona president Joan Laporta has not yet been ruled out, but no date has been agreed on to begin negotiations over a potential new deal for Messi. Messi’s current contract expires in June and the 33-year-old has said that he will wait until the end of the season before making a decision. Laporta, speaking after Saturday’s 4-0 Copa del Rey final win over Athletic Bilbao, said he was “convinced” the Argentine would remain at Camp Nou. The Barca president is putting the finishing touches to the contract offer, having wanted to carry out an internal audit on the club’s finances first.
