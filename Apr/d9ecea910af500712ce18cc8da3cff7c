The presidency has remained mum over the return of President Muhammadu Buhari from London, the United Kingdom where he is currently undergoing a medical check-up. Recall that on Tuesday, March 30, 2021, exactly two weeks ago, the president departed Nigeria for London where he was expected to receive medical attention from his physician. Prior to his departure, a statement from the Presidential Spokesman, Garba Shehu, stated that Buhari was expected to return to the country within the second week of April. According to Garba Shehu, the president “is due back in the country during the second week of April 2021.” Meanwhile, the second week ends today, April 15 without an update from the presidency regarding the president’s return. Recall that the president’s trip to the UK had stimulated controversies within and outside the country as many antagonized the decision to receive medical attention from foreign doctors. Recall that some Nigerians residing in the United Kingdom, on April 2, stormed the Abuja House, 2 Campden Hill, Kensington, in London demanding for Buhari’s repatriation back to the country. The group led by a former presidential aide, Reno Omokri blamed the president for not improving the healthcare system in Nigeria, stressing that it was a shame for a president to consistently patronize foreign doctors at the detriment of the local health workers.
