Chelsea winger, Christian Pulisic, has disclosed that manager, Thomas Tuchel, wants him to use his ingenuity at the west London club. Pulisic said this ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League quarter-final second-leg tie against FC Porto on Tuesday. The 22-year-old and Tuchel worked together during their time at Bundesliga giants, Borussia Dortmund. Pulisic who scored a brace in Chelsea’s 4-1 win at Crystal Palace, told the Blues’ official website: “Obviously, it is a bit of a different system, and I’m playing in a bit of a different role when I’m playing, but it is nothing that I’m not used to. “He [Thomas Tuchel] still wants me to use my creative abilities and do what I do as a player. It’s not a massive change. Positionally a bit, but that is about it.” Pulisic added, “The movement was very good against [Crystal] Palace. We had a good connection upfront, and obviously, we have a lot of dangerous players up there, so it clicked very well for us.”
