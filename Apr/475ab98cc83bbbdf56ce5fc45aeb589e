The federal government has urged stakeholders to ensure the use of natural resources and clean technology to mitigate changes in the environment necessitated climate change. Minister of State for Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, in a statement signed by the Director of Press, Sagir El Mohammed, noted that natural resources could serve as a tool for environmental sustainability and ecosystems restoration. Ikeazor, who emphasised the need for clean technologies to meet Nigeria’s emission reduction target, made the call as part of activities to mark the 2020 World Earth Day. The Minister explained that climate change remains the biggest threat to the future of humanity and the support systems that make the world habitable. “It is a day that stimulates worldwide awareness of climate change and the environment and should therefore enhance stronger government political commitment and massive public action to address all environmental issues. “We will focus on inspiring, sensitizing and enlightening Nigerians to take action to mitigate climate change. “There is a sustained effort to sensitize the citizenry to adopt clean technologies to meet Nigeria’s emission reduction target; even as we have developed the National Forest Reference Emission Factor Level (FREL) and submitted it to the UNFCCC.” The Minister said the Federal Government has scaled up its commitment to promoting Nigeria’s capacity to stand against climate change through the ratification of the Paris Agreement by Mr. President. She said, “We are currently reviewing the National Policy on Climate Change for more effectiveness with readiness for Nigeria’s National Adaptation Plan Framework for Climate Change (NAPs – Framework).” World Earth Day celebrated every 22nd April, started in 1970 as an environmental movement to engage public consciousness on the state of the planet. The 50th year commemoration of Earth Day has the theme, “Restore our Earth.”
