A rights advocacy group, Concerned Nigerians, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to resign. The group anchored its claim on the failure of the economy and killings in the country. The Deji Adeyanju-led group stated this in a series of tweets on its verified Twitter handle. According to the group, the President has failed to protect basic human rights of Nigerians among other things, hence should vacate his office. The tweets read: “We are calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to resign now. “Enough is Enough. “Lives are being lost everyday. Economy is in shambles. “Our unity is being threatened. “President Muhammadu is a failure. “The primary functions of government are to protect the basic human rights which include right to life, liberty and to possess property. “Buhari has failed in all of these. “If he has any honour left in him, it’s time to resign.”
