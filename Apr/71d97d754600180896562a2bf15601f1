Florence Ajimobi, wife of late Oyo State Governor Abiola Ajimobi, has declared that life is short. She advised Nigerians to show gratitude and sharing to others despite the challenges in Nigeria. Florence spoke to leaders of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Oyo State Council, on Iftar (Breaking of fast) at her Oluyole residence in Ibadan. The widow said the life outside office is usually different but noted she was prepared. “I was prepared for a lot of betrayal and hostility, but I didn’t get it. I am saying this with all sense of sincerity. “Life is short. For everyone you appreciate, let them know you appreciate them. For everyone you love, show them and tell them as many times as you can that you love them.” Florence recalled her husband admired journalists and enjoyed being around them. Ajimobi’s wife promised she would do anything to immortalise her husband and uphold his legacy. Oyo State NUJ Chairman, Alhaji Ademola Babalola, thanked her for the love and honour extended to the union. Babalola commended Florence for being and urged her to uphold the legacy.
