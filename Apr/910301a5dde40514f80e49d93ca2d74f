The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and other agencies have foiled an attempted jailbreak by inmates in Edo State. The inmates tried to escape from the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) at Ubiaja in Esan South East Local Government Area. Richard Ogbebor, the Public Relations Officer (PRO) in a statement said the incident occurred from 15:00 hours to 17:00 hours on Wednesday. The corps deployed a team led by Samuel Ogbeide, an Assistant Superintendent of Corps 1 to the facility. By then, the inmates had broken out from their cells and were engaging correctional officers in a fight. Some sustained injuries. Ogbefor said troops from the Nigerian Army 4th Brigade and the Police officers assisted in overpowering the prisoners. The NSCDC spokesman added that security has been beefed up at the centre.
