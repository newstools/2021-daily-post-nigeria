Olusegun Bamgbose, National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to declare state of emergency in Kaduna State without further delay. Bamgbose warned that the life of the Governor of the State, Nasir El-Rufai and his family may be in danger at this point, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to save the State. The senior lawyer noted that the spate of insecurity in Kaduna is fast becoming intractable, recalling the killing of students of Greenfield University and many others, including the 65 people from Adada abducted with no trace yet. “The abducted students from School of forestry are yet to be released. It’s now becoming a daily affair. In a matter of months, Kaduna can be overrun by bandits,” he said in a statement to DAILY POST on Monday. “It’s against this backdrop that it will be strongly advisable for President Buhari to declare State of Emergency in Kaduna State. “The security situation in the State is getting worse. The truth remains that the live of the Governor, El Rufai is in danger. In view of his noble stand to exterminate the bandits. “One does not need to be a prophet to know that bandits may have plans to harm him. The wise thing for Buhari to do should be to immediately declare State of emergency in Kaduna State in order to prevent the occurrence of any ugly incident. “One can only rule if he is alive. The activities of the bandits in Kaduna State is fast becoming worrisome. The time to decisively act is now before there is anarchy,” he said.
