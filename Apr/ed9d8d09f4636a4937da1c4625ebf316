Bashir Ahmad, Personal Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on New Media, on Monday, denied reports that United States government has placed Nigeria’s Minister of Com­munications, Isa Pantami on terror watch-list. Reports had emerged on Sunday that Pantami had been placed on the list over alleged ties with Boko Haram leader. The report claimed that the minister was said to be a close confidant of the late Mohammed Yusuf, the late leader of Boko Haram. It also claimed that Pantami had ties with Abu Quata­da al Falasimi and other Al-Qaeda leaders whom he revered and spoke highly of. But reacting, Bashir in a tweet described the report as ‘fake news.’ He maintained that the Minister has never been on any US watchlist. He wrote, ”You have just endorsed a fake report without verifying. For your information @DrIsaPantamihas never been on any US watchlist.”
