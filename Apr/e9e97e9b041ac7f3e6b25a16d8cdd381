The Kwara State Police Command has arrested three cattle traders for allegedly kidnapping and killing a man who wanted to buy a cow from them for his wedding. The Police Spokesperson in the State, Ajayi Okasanmi, who confirmed the arrest to newsmen gave the name of the suspects as Kazeem, Mohammed Chatta, Jimoh Abdulateef and Madi Jeremiah. Okasanmi said that Kazeem, who is also the leader of the gang was alleged to have collected N160,000 from the victim, Olokose Oluwasola Ojo, to get him a cow for his wedding scheduled for March 12 and 13 this year. According to him, security operatives were alerted after Ojo’s fiancée received a phone call from his line, demanding for N12 million ransom if she hoped to see him again. He further stated that an investigation into the matter led to the arrest of the suspects who also confessed to killing the victim and burying him in a shallow grave inside the bush. “The suspects in their confessional statement said they lured the victim into the remote part of Patigi where he was told the cow he paid for was being kept but was shot dead on getting to the spot. “They also took policemen to the scene of the killing where the head of the victim and arm was severed and used for money ritual by Mohammed Kazeem, the leader of the gang. “The body of the victim has been taken to the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital mortuary for autopsy. “The suspects will be charged to court as soon as court resumes sitting,” he said.
