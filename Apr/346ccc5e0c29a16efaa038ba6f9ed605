Governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu, has advocated for what he called a reversal of the assault on earth in order to restore the earth’s originality and make it a more comfortable place for all to live on. The governor made the call in a series of tweets via his official Twitter handle in commemoration of World Earth Day being marked worldwide today (Thursday). The governor, who recalled how God created the earth and handed same to man to care for, regretted that man’s activities have ended up exploiting and plundering the earth to the extent that even the seas have “been polluted and its life extinguished”. Governor Ikpeazu expressed fears “that these elements are now fighting back, and if they unleash their powers on us, earth would be a very uncomfortable place to be in”. He, however, expressed hope that “we can reverse this assault on our earthly abode by changing the way we live” and called on all to heed the call of this year’s theme, ‘Restore Our Earth’ by rethinking “our interactions with these elements and imbibe more sustainable procedures in the manufacturing and application of goods we consume”, warning that there could be unimaginable consequences for generations to come if the warning is not heeded. World Earth Day is usually marked on April 22 of every year.
