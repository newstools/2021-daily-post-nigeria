Arsenal legend, Martin Keown, has warned Mikel Arteta that he is in the danger of losing his job, following a 1-1 draw with Slavia Prague on Thursday. The Gunners took the lead through Nicolas Pepe with four minutes left, but conceded a late equalizer in their Europa League quarter-final first leg at home. Keown has now warned that Arteta is in danger of being sacked if things continue to go against Arsenal. He said on BT Sport: “Hugely disappointing and really it’s going to be difficult now for Arteta. “He’s made a lot of changes at the football club, a lot of people have been allowed to go, and this is his team now, essentially. “There have been a lot of problems at Arsenal over a number of years, certain players coming in and out at the football club, so it’s not all at his doorstep. “But he’s in charge now, and he’s not quite getting the reaction out of the team. “He was disappointed at the end there. He’s encouraging people to play, then at the end when he doesn’t want them to play, it’s a mixed message, isn’t it? “They’ve got to do the right things at the right times and they’re making sloppy mistakes and it cost them tonight.”
