Brazilian legend, Rivaldo, has predicted Real Madrid to reach the Champions League final this season at the expense of Chelsea. Rivaldo believes Real Madrid’s experience and know-how at this stage of the Champions League will give them an edge over the Premier League giants. Chelsea will tackle Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final fixture later this month. Thomas Tuchel’s men eliminated FC Porto from the Champions League quarter-final encounter a few days ago, while the LaLiga champions knocked Liverpool out from the competition. “I see Real Madrid as the favourite to reach the [Champions League] final because they have a solid and very experienced squad which always tends to play better in these kinds of decisive matches, becoming a specialist in the last decade,” Rivaldo told Betfair. “Chelsea also have their strengths and shouldn’t be discounted, but I think Madrid have more experience to claim another Champions League final spot – and they know how to win it. “All those press critics of Zinedine Zidane that we saw in the middle of the season seem to have vanished after such a great response from the team. “At the moment, Real Madrid is fighting for the La Liga title and also progressing well in the Champions League, counteracting all the comments about a potential loss of faith in Zidane from the club and players. “The coach and all the squad must be congratulated for their efforts in turning the situation around in such a great fashion.” —
