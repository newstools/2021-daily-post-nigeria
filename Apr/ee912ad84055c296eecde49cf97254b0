Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Friday, said Nigeria may become a failed state under the All Progressives Congress (APC) government. The governors reaffirmed that urgent devolution of powers and restructuring had become imperative, warning that “Nigeria cannot afford another civil war”. After a meeting in Makurdi, the Benue State capital, their communiqué said the country was drifting due to insecurity and deteriorating relationship between various groups. The governors observed that differences were being stretched to the limit “by a government that clearly lacks the capacity to govern”. The meeting agreed that this has given rise to ethnic and tribal tensions, religious divisions, and various forms of social and political cleavages. The governors insisted that Nigeria is in dire need of leadership, “to avert the looming disaster”. The PDP chieftains protested that their “hands are tied behind” because the entire “coercive authority in the country” is monopolized by the APC government. They said time has come to take advantage of the ongoing Constitution Amendment process to decentralize Nigeria’s security architecture and adequately involve States and Local Governments. The communique urged the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission to send a new Allocation Formula that allocates more resources to States and Local Governments to the President for National Assembly’s action.
