The newly elected Senator representing Imo North senatorial district, Chukwuma Frank Ibezim has been sworn in. He was elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress in a bye-election. His election was a subject of controversy until the Supreme Court delivered judgment in his favour on Monday, 5th April, 2021. In arriving at its decision, the apex court in a unanimous judgment voided, nullified and set aside the concurrent judgments of the Federal High Court in Abuja and that of the Court of Appeal which nullified the candidacy of Ibezim on the ground of perjury. Justice Emmanuel Agim who delivered the judgment held that the suit which led to disqualification of Ibezim for allegedly supplying false information to secure nomination was statute barred at the time it was instituted. Justice Agim said in the judgment that the suit was not filed within 14 days when the cause of action arose. Reacting to Senator Ibezim’s oath of allegiance, Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan said, “Imo North is fully represented we wish him a robust representation.” Ibezim took over from the late Senator Benjamin Uwajumogun who died in November 2019.
