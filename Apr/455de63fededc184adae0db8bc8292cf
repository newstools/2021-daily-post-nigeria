Chelsea has already made its first signing of the summer, according to a Brazilian radio presenter, Paco Belmonte. Belmonte reports that Palmeiras midfielder Gabriel Menino has been signed by the West London outfit. He said the deal has been completed for the Brazilian star to join the Blues this summer. Reports in Brazil suggest that Chelsea made an offer of Â£13 million to sign the highly-rated 20-year-old. In a tweet last night, Belmonte said the players have been signed although the Blues are yet to confirm it.
