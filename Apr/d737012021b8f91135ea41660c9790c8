Chelsea midfielder, Mateo Kovacic, has opened up on Antonio Rudiger’s training ground fight with Kepa Arrizabalaga. Recall that Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, had dismissed Rudiger from training on Easter Day after a fight with Kepa. Rudiger and Kepa were involved in an altercation at Chelsea’s training ground following their Premier League 5-2 home shock defeat against West Brom over the weekend. Reacting to the development ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League quarter-final first-leg clash with Porto on Wednesday night, Kovacic insisted that the incident has been left behind, adding that it was just a competition in the dressing room. Asked about the scuffle involving Rudiger and Kepa, Kovacic told reporters at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday: “It’s not a big deal. It’s just competition in the dressing room and we spoke about it, all cleared, so it’s all done. “We are a strong group, and these things happen in a family and in strong groups. We accept it, we leave it behind, we clear it, and we are all focused together for the game tomorrow [against Porto].” He added, “It’s a difficult draw. Porto is a good team which we saw already against Juventus. “They knocked out a big opponent, so they showed togetherness and great spirit. It will be a tough game because they fight together, and they stick together. “It will be a tough game like every game in the Champions League, but we are prepared for it, and tomorrow is a big day for us. ‘I’m sure the whole team is focused.”
