The Director-General of the National Inland Waterways (NIWA), Dr George Moghalu has advised the All Progressives Congress (APC) to ensure it holds a free and fair primary election to choose the candidate of the party for the Anambra governorship election. Moghalu spoke yesterday, during a meeting with the Anambra APC elders forum in Awka. “The party has released its guidelines for that primary election, but they are yet to release the modalities. “I don’t want to tell them what modalities to adopt for the election because if I do, people will say I’m an interested party. “But I want to advise the party to ensure it holds a free and fair primary election in choosing a candidate for the governorship election.” Moghalu said his aspiration for the governorship seat of the state was based on his confidence in the people and the knowledge that only God gives power. He said he was not in doubt that if the contest is fair, he would clinch the ticket of the APC for the contest. Moghalu would in June be slugging it out with about 10 other aspirants for the governorship ticket of the APC, for the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State.
