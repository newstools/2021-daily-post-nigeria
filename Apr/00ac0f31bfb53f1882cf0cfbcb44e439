Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan has claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari has become a “prisoner at Abuja House” in London. Omokri claimed that protesters have confined Buhari indoors, thereby stopping him from going out to see his doctors. Buhari is currently in London for his routine medical checkup. The president’s trip had led Nigerians resident in London to embark on a peaceful protest, demanding he immediately return to Nigeria and fix the country’s healthcare. Omokri stressed that the protesters have been able to frustrate the president’s movement. In a series of tweets, the former presidential aide wrote: “The #HarassBuhariOutofLondon movement has effectively made General @MBuhari a prisoner at Abuja House. He is under house arrest. “He can’t come out. He can’t sneak out to see his beloved doctors. We have shown him who really has the power. Power belongs to the people! Now he knows. “I thank Nigerians for coming out for day 2 of the #HarassBuhariOutofLondon. Somebody suspected to be Buhari was peeping through the window. “Their plan to go to the doctor was frustrated. For the second day, General @MBuhari was trapped at Abuja House. What a good day for Nigeria!”
