The captain’s armband of Cristiano Ronaldo, which ended up on the grass of the Belgrade Maracana after the qualifying match for the World Cup Serbia – Portugal, has been bought by the company Mozzart Bet at a humanitarian auction and thus provided 63.728 euros for the treatment of little Gavrilo Djurdjevic. The auction was conducted through the “Limundo“ website by the organization “Together for Life”, and ended when Mozzart Bet offer was declared the best. Ronaldo threw the ribbon on the grass dissatisfied with the unrecognized goal, and it was taken by the young firefighter Djordje Vukicevic, with the humane intention of using it to help little Gavrilo. Gavrilo was born on September 7, 2020, and three months after his birth, he was diagnosed with a rare neuromuscular disease SMA 1 (spinal muscular atrophy type 1). His hope is pinned on a one-time gene treatment Zolgensma, also known as the “world’s most expensive drug”, which would cost more than two million euros ($2.35 million). SMA affects about one in 10,000 births and results in death or the need for permanent ventilation by the age of two in 90 percent of cases. Only hours after being put on auction, the armband had reached the price of 360,000 dinars (around 3,000 euros), and in the end, Mozzart Bet paid it 63.728 euros. MOZZART BET, Make A Decision!
