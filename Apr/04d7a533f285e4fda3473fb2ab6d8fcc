Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has added forward, Anthony Elanga, to his side’s squad to face Granada in the Europa League quarter-final, first-leg tie in Spain on Thursday night. Man United disclosed this in a statement on the club’s official website on Tuesday. The Red Devils head to the game following a 2-1 win over Brighton in the Premier League on Sunday. The statement read, “The Reds are due to fly to Spain on Wednesday for the quarter-final first leg, and Elanga is the latest youngster in contention for a place as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer continues to show his faith in youth. “Clubs are allowed to add homegrown players to their B list for the competition if they meet certain criteria. “The reigning Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year is fit again after a collarbone injury sustained after scoring twice in the Under-23s’ Premier League 2 clash with Leicester City in January. “He joined in with the senior session at the Aon Training Complex on Tuesday. “The speedy 18-year-old forward signed a new contract at United last month after rising through the ranks.” Elanga has been a key figure for Neil Wood’s Under-23s. The Sweden youth international appeared as a substitute in the first team’s only pre-season friendly, at Aston Villa, before the 2020/21 campaign kicked off.
