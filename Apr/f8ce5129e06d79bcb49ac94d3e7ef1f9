The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) has expressed fret over the recent attacks on security formations in Imo, Benue States and other parts of Nigeria. The NGF Chairman and Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, disclosed this to newsmen at the end of the forum’s meeting in Abuja on Wednesday night. Fayemi said, “NGF members are particularly worried following what happened in Imo State, the attacks on the correctional facility and the police command headquarters. “The release of prisoners, and successive acts of violence and insecurity across the country, and the killings of soldiers at Benue. “The forum has expressed its worry that it’s time for us to revisit the nature and depth of this security crisis comprehensively. “The crisis would’ve become worse if states had not been taking the actions they’ve been taking individually and collectively. “It is the steps taken at the state level that have managed to reduce the depths and the enormity of the security challenges. Nonetheless, it is still a worrisome development for us. “We feel we’ll need a special review of the entire gamut of the security issues that we’re dealing with. “We need to further engage the federal authorities both at the political level and federal authorities at the security level, in order to deal with this multifaceted challenges of security that we’re faced with.” Fayemi disclosed that the governors also reviewed the economy as well as Executive Order No 10 of 2020 and related matters. According to him, the forum took its positions on issues regarding Order 10 and financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature. Fayemi, who didn’t disclose the resolutions, said that the NGF committees would meet with the judiciary and legislature representatives on Thursday to present those resolutions directly to them.
