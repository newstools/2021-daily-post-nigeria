Rivers All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker Committee Chairman in Khana Local Government, Hyacinth Nwiye, is still in captivity. The state chapter of the party, in a statement, confirmed that the kidnappers were yet to release Nwiye who was snatched on Sunday. The spokesman, Ogbonna Nwuke, noted that the circumstances surrounding the incident proved Nigeria faces a big security challenge. “We have been briefed that he was taken into captivity at a time people were celebrating the resurrection of our Lord, the Son of God.” Nwuke said the act was perpetrated due to the inability of the Rivers State Government to “guarantee protection at the grassroots”. The party appealed for the unconditional and immediate release of the politician. The APC urged security agencies to intensify their manhunt for those responsible for Nwiye’s disappearance.
