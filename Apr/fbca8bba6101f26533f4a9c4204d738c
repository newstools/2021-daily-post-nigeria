Biafra Nations League, BNL, says it has introduced the Biafran pounds in the Bakassi Peninsula, a region in Cross Rivers State. The secessionist group said the decision follows the visit of its national leader, Princewill Chimezie Richard to the region. Henry Edet, Chief Head of Operations of BNL, said in a statement to DAILY POST on Tuesday that the Biafran currency of 1967 is still recognized by the group. The group said the currency has been handed to members in the region. He said the “Biafran pounds would gradually replace the Nigeria and Cameroon currency in the Peninsula,” insisting that “any form of harassments by Cameroon as a result of introducing the currency would amount to rebellion.” They added that it has welcomed the decision of major oil companies to quit Nigeria, adding that “it was long-awaited.” The group vowed that the Nigerian economy will collapse.
