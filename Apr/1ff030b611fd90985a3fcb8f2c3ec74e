The Resident Doctors Association, Enugu State University Teaching Hospital (ESUTH) Chapter, says it has joined its national body to embark on an indefinite strike. The President of the association, ESUTH branch, Dr Chima Edoga, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu on Friday. Edoga noted that the reason for the strike is as a result of non payment of salaries to some resident doctors in Federal Government-owned hospitals. “Especially those that are house officers, who are the lowest cadres of doctors. “Also some doctors were recently employed in December but yet to be captured into the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS),” he added. According to him, the Federal Government is yet to implement the demanded upward review of the current hazard allowance it agreed with the association. Edoga added that there was no payment of insurance packages to the family members of doctors who died as a result of COVID-19 infection and other infectious diseases. He, however, applauded Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State, on his effort in paying of doctors’ salaries and upgrading of health facilities in the state. He urged the state government to employ more doctors as many doctors were leaving government health institutions in their numbers.
