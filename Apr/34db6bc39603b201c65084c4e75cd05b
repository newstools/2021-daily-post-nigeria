The Universal Basic Education Commission, UBEC has said the Better Education Service Delivery for All” (BESDA) initiative will not thrive except there is the active participation of UBE Information Managers in the process. The assertion is contained in a press statement signed by the Commissions Head Public Relation and Protocol, David Apeh. The Deputy Executive Secretary (Services), Dr. Isiaka Kolawale Olayinka in the statement said Information Communication was the key strategy needed to enhance performance at every level of the programme. He said there was a need to include information managers if the Education delivery services are to be improved. To achieve this, the Universal Basic Education Commission has now commenced training of Public Relations Officers drafted to the BESDA program at the federal and state levels. Dr. Olayinka said the training seeks to inform and guide the conduct of communications officers in the implementation of the BESDA program. He noted that the BESDA initiative requires deliberate sensitization and mobilization of every critical stakeholder at each stage of the programme implementation. ”This training will provide an effective response to identified UBE delivery and communication challenges and also provide fresh and innovative perspectives in engaging stakeholders’ state and non-actors, parents and other stakeholders”. The Deputy Executive Secretary (Technical) Dr. Bala Zakari said the BESDA programme seeks to support designated Federal and State Agencies on increasing access to education for out-of-school children and improving literacy in the focus states. He said the BESDA intervention will focus on states with the largest population of out-of-school children in the country.
