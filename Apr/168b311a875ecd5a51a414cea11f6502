Liverpool forward, Mohamed Salah, could leave Anfield ahead of the 2021/2022 campaign. The 28-year-old has again been in fine form for the Premier League champions this season. Salah has netted 25 times in 40 appearances in all competitions, including 17 goals in 28 league outings. His current deal with Liverpool only has a little over two years left to run and he has again been speaking about a potential move to Spain recently. According to ESPN, there is a growing belief within the Liverpool squad, that the Egypt international could decide to seek pastures new during this summerâ€™s transfer window. It is also understood that intermediaries who have worked closely with the Reds, feel a move could be possible in the upcoming transfer market.
