Tottenham manager, Jose Mourinho has hit back at his Manchester United counterpart, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after the Norwegian tactician slammed Son Heung-min following the Red Devils’ 3-1 win over Tottenham on Sunday. Solskjaer was angered by the reaction of Son and other Tottenham players after United had a goal disallowed in the first half. Edinson Cavani’s 35th-minute effort was ruled out by the centre referee and VAR after Scott McTominay’s foul on the South Korea international during the build-up of the goal And Solskjaer after the game accused Son of theatrics to convince the referee, adding that he would not feed his own son if he had reacted the same way on the pitch. In reaction, Mourinho said, “First of all let me tell you something, I’m very, very surprised that after the comments that Ole made on Sonny you don’t ask me about it,” said Mourinho. “Because, and I told Ole this because I met him just a few minutes ago, if it’s me saying that a player A, B or C from another club, ‘if it was my son I wouldn’t give him dinner tonight’, what would be the reaction of that level? “It’s very, very sad, and I think it’s really sad you don’t ask me about it. I think it’s really sad you don’t have the moral honesty to treat me the same way you treat others. “In relation to that, I will say Sonny is very lucky that his father is a better person than Ole, “Because a father you have always to feed your kids, doesn’t matter what they do. “If you have to steal to feed your kids you steal. I’m very, very disappointed. With me, like we say in Portugal, bread is bread and cheese is cheese. “I have told Ole already what I think about his comments. “And I have to tell you I’m very disappointed that [after] five, six, seven questions you ignore the dimension of that comment.”
