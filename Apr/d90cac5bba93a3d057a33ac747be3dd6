Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, on Saturday clashed with Lille’s Tiago Djalo, in the tunnel at the Parc des Princes following his side’s Ligue 1 1-0 home defeat against Christophe Galtier’s side. Lille defeated PSG thanks to Jonathan David’s first-half goal as Neymar and Djalo were sent off late in the second half of the game. Neymar saw red in stoppage time of the encounter, retaliating furiously after a rough challenge from defender Djalo. The Brazilian earned his second-yellow for shoving Djalo, who was also sent off for his foul-mouthed rant aimed at the former Barcelona star. Both players continued rowing as they walked off the pitch together, with Neymar taking a swipe at the 20-year-old centre-back once an official had got between both men in the tunnel. Djalo then knocked one of the men trying to restrain him to the ground as he tried to retaliate before the furious footballers were finally ushered into their respective dressing-rooms. Neymar will now face a ban and yet more time on the sidelines after only returning from injury for PSG’s 4-2 win over Lyon last month. The winger has only managed 12 games in the league this season, with his season blighted by injury and suspensions. The flare-up against Lille was Neymar’s second red card of the season, having been sent-off for his part in a mass brawl that erupted in stoppage-time as PSG lost 1-0 to rivals Marseille some weeks ago.
