Gunmen on Tuesday attacked another police station in Imo State, freed suspects in detention and razed it down. This happened barely 24 hours after the Imo State Correctional Centre and the State Police Headquarters were attacked on Monday with many inmates set free. Tuesdayâ€™s incident happened a few hours after Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and outgoing Inspector General of Police (IGP), Muhammed Adamu left the State. The VP, IGP and the Minister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola, were in the state to inspect the level of damage on the burnt security facilities. The Gunmen attacked and burnt Ehime Mbano Local Government Area Divisional Police Headquarters on Tuesday. Without any form of investigation, the outgoing IGP Adamu had yesterday accused members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, and the Eastern Security Network, ESN, of carrying out the attacks. This was after the IPOB in a statement by its spokesman, Emma Powerful, denied any involvement in the dastardly act. The gunmen were said to have operated without any resistance from Security agencies on Tuesday.
