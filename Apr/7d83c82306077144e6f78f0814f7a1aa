Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has said he won’t invite new players when they begin their 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign in June. Nigeria rounded off their Africa Cup of Nations qualifying series with a 3-0 win over Lesotho. Next up for the three-time African champions, is the second qualifying round for the World Cup. They have been drawn with Cape Verde, Central African Republic and Liberia in Group C. “The World Cup qualifiers will start soon and I think we will be able to do well, and we should expect good football again on a good pitch. “We can’t try new players now, it is too late and it is getting more serious because it is World Cup qualifiers,” Rohr told the media. Enyimba winger, Anayo Iwuala, was the only fresh face who played for the Super Eagles in the just-concluded international break. New invitees goalkeeper John Noble and Abia Warriors’ Adeleke Adekunle, were unused substitutes.
