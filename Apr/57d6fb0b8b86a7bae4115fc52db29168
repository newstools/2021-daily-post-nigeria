The Premier League is guaranteed to be the highest ranked European league for the first time in nine years, displacing LaLiga from top spot. This comes after Manchester United’s 6-2 win over AS Roma in the Europa League semi-final first leg. The UEFA’s coefficient table ranks leagues in order of strength in European competitions over a five-year period, all the way back to the 2012/2013 season. Even if Real Madrid lift the Champions League trophy and Villarreal win the Europa League, it will not stop England moving to the No. 1 position. English clubs have outperformed their Spanish counterparts in three of the last five seasons. UEFA COEFFICIENT TABLE
