Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has lambasted Son Heung-min for the role the South Korean played in Manchester United’s disallowed goal during their 3-1 win over Tottenham on Sunday. Manchester United legend, Roy Keane had earlier slammed the South Korea international for acting embarrassingly. Solskjaer and his men thought they had taken the lead 10 minutes before the breakthrough of Edinson Cavani but the goal was ruled out after a VAR check that showed that Scott McTominay put his hand in Son’s face. Son then scored for Tottenham before half time but United came back very strong in the second half with Fred, Cavani and Mason Greenwood all scoring to give the Red Devils all three points. However, Solskjaer was not happy with the reaction of Son and Spurs’ players for the disallowed goal. “The game has gone. The game has absolutely gone,’ Solskjaer told Sky Sports. “If that’s a clear and obvious error, it’s an obvious error he had to look at it. It was a perfectly good goal. “But then again we shouldn’t be conned. But I have to say if my son stays down like this for three minutes and he gets his 10 mates around him to help him up, yeah, he won’t get any food. “I’m saying the same now as I did the first time we played them. ‘We weren’t conned, the referee was.
