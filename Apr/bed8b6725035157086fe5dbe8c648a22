Kwara United midfielder, Jude Steven, has insisted that the signing of Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa, by the Nigeria Professional Football League, NPFL, club, Kano Pillars isn’t a threat to his team because they also have a former national team player, Dele Aiyenugba. Recall that Musa promised to lead Kano Pillars to win the NPFL title after receiving his jersey number on Thursday evening at the club’s Secretariat in Kano on Thursday. Reacting to Kano Pillars’s signing of Musa, Steven told Lagos-based Brila FM, “It’s going to be a very good advantage for them [Kano Pillars], but with that, we are still going to push. “It’s not that a big threat for us because we are focused and have an ex-Nigeria international in Dele Aiyenugba who gives us the confidence to push through, so we are as good as they also have a national team player, so there is no cause for alarm.” Musa has been without a club since leaving Saudi Arabian club, Al Nassr last October. The former Leicester City winger also failed to seal a deal with Premier League club, West Brom last January transfer window.
