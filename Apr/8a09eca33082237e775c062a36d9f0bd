Former Chelsea star, Chris Sutton has tipped his old club to beat Real Madrid in the semi-finals of the Champions League. Both teams clashed in one of the semi-final ties of the League. Chelsea and Zinedine Zidane’s whites are due to clash in the competition’s semi-finals later this month. The West London Blues saw off FC Porto of Portugal to reach this stage whilst Real Madrid beat Liverpool to qualify for the last four. Manchester City also made it to the semi-finals and will face Paris Saint Germain. “It’s going to be a difficult team for Chelsea to beat, but you wouldn’t put it past them under Tuchel,” Sutton told BT Sport. “It’s an impossible one to call. If you are asking me, I think Chelsea may just edge it. One of my former clubs may just edge it.”
