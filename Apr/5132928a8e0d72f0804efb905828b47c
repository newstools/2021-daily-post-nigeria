Juventus fans have issued a death threat to manager Andrea Pirlo and his teenage son, Nicolo. Apart from the death threats, they were also abused on social media. Old Lady is now fourth in the Serie A standings, with only five games remaining. Seventeen-year-old Nicolo Pirlo shared the threat on his Instagram account where he also told the club’s supporters that he understands he is the son of a coach who may “not be liked by some,” and urged people to put themselves in his shoes “for just a second.” The young man then included a screenshot of a message that he received from someone which read, “You and your father must die.” Nicolo, who is the eldest of Pirlo’s four children, wrote: “Every day I receive messages of this kind… I receive messages of death threats and various insults every day. “I’m not a person who judges, I don’t like doing it, everyone has the right to be able to say what they want, I’m the first to do it and I would never want anyone to take away my freedom of speech. “My parents taught me to have ideas and above all to listen to those of others, but I believe that there is a limit to everything and this limit has already been exceeded for some time.” Juventus have not been in their best performance under Andrea Pirlo and had crashed out of the Champions League to FC Porto in the last 16. Their next Serie A game will be a visit to Udinese on Sunday before hosting AC Milan in a battle for fourth place.
