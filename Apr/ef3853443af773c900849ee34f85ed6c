Former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, said he received with shock, news of the death of Afenifere spokesman, Yinka Odumakin. Tinubu, in a statement on Saturday, described the deceased as a committed fighter for democracy, dedicated civil society activist, courageous and outspoken defender of whatever ideals and principles he believed in. The All Progressives Congress (APC) leader said Odumakin remained fearless and unrelenting in speaking up in promoting the cause of justice and what he perceived as the best interest of the citizens of Nigeria. Tinubu recalled his participation in the various students and youth struggles against successive military dictatorships in the 1980s and 1990s. “In the process, he was arrested, harassed and even detained several times. Yet, he never allowed himself to succumb to tyranny or be pressured into submissive and pliant silence. “In the struggle against the annulment of the June 12, 1993, presidential election and the perpetuation of military dictatorship, Odumakin was never found wanting. He was at the vanguard of the battle even at the risk of his life and liberty.” Tinubu said the late activist never held public office, but was a constant feature and part of our public consciousness over the last two decades of Nigeria’s unbroken democratic dispensation. “He epitomized the true definition of the citizen; a patriot who was ever conscious of the fact that his life could not be complete or his humanity meaningful if he did not take an active interest in and join like minded fellow citizens in seeking always to promote the common good of his community and country.” Tinubu condoled with the family and prayed that God will comfort and strengthen them as they take solace in the massive outpouring of grief. He expressed condolences to Chief Ayo Adebanjo, the Afenifere leader, other leaders and members of the Yoruba apex group as well as all Yinka’s associates in the civil society movement.
