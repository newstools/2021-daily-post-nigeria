Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has warned his team to beware of two key players from the Crystal Palace stables. Chelsea will face Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday evening at the Selhurst Park Stadium. Tuchel’s men head to the game following a 2-0 victory over FC Porto in the Champions League on Wednesday night. Chelsea is currently in the fifth position on the log with 51 points from 30 games. “Crystal Palace is a physical team and has two key players up front, which we absolutely need to be aware of,” Tuchel told a pre-match press conference on Friday. “It is a pleasure to be on the sideline with Roy Hodgson and it means a lot to me, but we will do everything to beat him tomorrow. We expect a tough away game.” The kick-off time for Crystal Palace vs Chelsea is 5.30 pm.
