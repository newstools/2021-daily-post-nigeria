Borno South Senator, Ali Ndume has called on the Presidency to expose the identities of the 400 Bureau de Change, BDC, operators arrested over alleged funding of Boko Haram terrorists. Ndume said their identities should be revealed and their trial should be done publicly, irrespective of how highly placed they are. The lawmaker disclosed this while fielding questions from journalists in Abuja on Sunday. President Muhammadu Buhari’s spokesman, Garba Shehu had recently accused some BDC operators of funding Boko Haram. Reacting to Shehu’s remark, Ndume said: “The presidency said recently that Nigerians would be shocked if it revealed the identities of those who are sponsoring the Boko Haram insurgents. “When the BDC operators are arrested now, what will the government do with them. The presidency is already saying their case is confidential. What is confidential about it? “The presidency should expose the identities of all the BDC operators so far arrested and carry out their trial in public. “If any of them is innocent, he should be allowed to go while those found guilty must be made to face the music.”
