Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says Thomas Tuchel’s fine start to his reign at Chelsea is not surprising to him, adding that he knows the German gaffer too well. Tuchel became Chelsea manager at the end of January following the sack of Frank Lampard. The former Borussia Dortmund manager has managed to guide Chelsea to Champions League and FA Cup semi-finals. Tuchel failed to record a win against Guardiola while the Spaniard was at Bayern Munich and he in charge at Mainz and Borussia Dortmund, but the former Barcelona coach said he was never in doubt that his opposite number would succeed at Chelsea. “I know him from Mainz,” Guardiola told the press on Friday. “When I was in Munich after he went to Dortmund and spent one or two games playing exactly the way he wanted to play. “It was difficult to take over a team during the season but he has a lot of experience winning at a top club like PSG and now another club at Chelsea. “I knew from the beginning he would do a good job. “‘Every manager plays in the way they play,’ Guardiola added on Tuchel’s style of football. “Frank did an incredible job in the first season when he could not sign players and qualified for the Champions League. “I admire both as a person and a manager. Tomorrow we face Thomas. ‘He knows how I admire him and how good he is as a manager. It will be a good battle.”
