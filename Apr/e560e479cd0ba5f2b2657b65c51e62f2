Cristiano Ronaldo’s rape accuser, Kathryn Mayorga, is demanding £56million in damages, the UK Mirror reports. Newly released court’s documents show the former model is seeking the money after accusing the Juventus forward of sexually assaulting her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009. Kathryn wants £18m for “past pain and suffering”, £18m for “future pain and suffering” and another £18m in punitive damages. The 37-year-old’s expenses add up to £1.4m with legal fees of £1.1m, giving a total of £56.5m, which is equal to two years of Ronaldo’s salary. Ronaldo has vigorously denied Mayorga’s claims. In 2010, she accepted around £270,000 as part of an out-of-court non-disclosure settlement. But three years ago, Mayorga filed a civil lawsuit, claiming she had been “mentally incapacitated” when she agreed to it and signed it under duress.
