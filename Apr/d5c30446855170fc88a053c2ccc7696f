Chelsea have qualified for the final of this year’s FA Cup. The Blues defeated Manchester City 1-0 in Saturday’s semi-final at Wembley Stadium. Hakim Ziyech scored the only goal of the game, tapping into an unguarded net from Timo Werner’s cross. The result ends Pep Guardiola’s dream of winning a Quadruple with City this season. Chelsea will now find out who they face in the final tomorrow, as Leicester City take on Southampton in the other semi-final. City returns to Premier League action on Wednesday with a trip to Aston Villa, while Chelsea host Brighton and Hove Albion the day before.
