The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF, has said that the leaders of the Southeast must ensure sanity within their region before negotiating for presidency in 2023. AYCF National President, Yerima Shettima made the remark in response to comments by Ohanaeze Ndigbo, apex Igbo socio-political Organisation that they would reach out to other regions to allow the Southeast produce Nigeria’s President in 2023. Speaking with DAILY POST, Shettima said it would be difficult to trust the Southeast with power amid the call for Nigeria’s breakup by groups and individuals from the region. Recall that the President-General of Ohanaeze, George Obiozor, had said 2023 was the turn of the Southeast to produce Nigeria’s president. Obiozor had disclosed that the South-East would negotiate with other regions to allow for an Igbo presidency in 2023. But Shettima said Nigerians would not deprive them such an opportunity if Southeast leaders deal with Igbo descents calling for Nigeria’s breakup. He said: “If Ohanaeze says they will negotiate, then that is a bit of politics but unfortunately for them, they need to ensure sanity in their region first. “Nobody will deprive them the opportunity to produce the president being a Nigerian but not when they have one of their own threatening the corporate existence of our nation, Nigeria. “They have not taken any decisive step to condemn the action and inactions of those criminally minded people, but expect Nigerians to entrust them with power. “It will be difficult to entrust them with power, it’s better for them to ensure sanity in their home before coming to the table to discuss with those on top so people can say they have shown commitment and not by threats and intimidations, those days are over.”
