President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the attack on the Police Command Headquarters and the Correctional Facility in Owerri, Imo State, on Monday. Recall that hoodlums on Monday attacked the State Police Headquarters and the Headquarters of the Nigerian Correctional Services (NCS) in Owerri on Monday. The suspects also set the prison ablaze and freed hundreds of inmates. Buhari in a statement by Garba Shehu, his Senior Special Assistant on Media & Publicity described the attack as an act of terrorism. He praised the initial response by security guards and security forces for preventing greater loss of life and the destruction of public property, directing them to fully mobilize and go after the hoodlums, apprehend them and get them punished under the full weight of the law. He also called for the best efforts to be made to rearrest fleeing prison detainees, many of whom are believed to be deadly criminals. Buhari also appealed to members of the public to assist the law enforcement agencies with relevant information that could lead to the apprehension of these criminals who perpetrated the act. He also urged members of the public to be vigilant as everyone has a stake in preventing disruptions by anarchists while promising that the Federal Government will use every available tool at its disposal to confront the criminals.
