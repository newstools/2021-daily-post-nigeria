Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said Bruno Fernandes scored his late penalty against Granada with only one eye. The Red Devils took control of their Europa League quarter-final tie with a 2-0 win in Spain. Marcus Rashford opened scoring in the first half, before Fernandes extended their advantage late in the game. Paul Scholes, working as a pundit for BT Sport, claimed United were lucky to be awarded the 90th minute penalty, after Yan Brice was adjudged to have caught Fernandes in the face. But Solskjaer, speaking after the game, said the clash was serious enough to close up one of Fernandes’ eyes. “I haven’t seen it [the incident], I’ve just seen his eye when he came off, he got hit. “Mike Phelan was sat behind me in the dugout and said he took one in the face. His eye is red and to score with one eye open is also a skill,” Solskjaer said.
