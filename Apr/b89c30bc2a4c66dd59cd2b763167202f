The Katsina State Judiciary Union, in solidarity with the ongoing nationwide strike, has suspended all court activities in the State until further notice. The strike, which began yesterday, is premised on the failure of the federal and state executive arm to comply with a Federal High Court judgment that granted financial autonomy status to the Nigeria judiciary since 2014. DAILY POST reports that the Katsina State High Court was locked and deserted yesterday to show compliance. The Vice-Chairman, Katsina Judiciary workers, Comrade Yusuf Sani said “all the courts in the state will remain locked until further notice from the National Secretariat of JUSUN Abuja.” The appeal to shelve the nationwide strike from both the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and Nigeria House of Representatives could not avert the strike. The Chairman, House Committee on Judiciary, Onofiok Luke, had appealed to the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria to give them more time to resolve the issue with the federal government. However, JUSUN claimed that it had already issued a 21-day ultimatum to the government to implement the financial autonomy of the judiciary since 13th March, 2021 and they were left with no option than to embark on the nationwide strike.
