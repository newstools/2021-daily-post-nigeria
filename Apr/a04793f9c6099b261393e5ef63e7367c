The plan by the Ogun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to unseat the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023 has been brushed aside by the ruling party. The Ogun APC described the PDP’s threat to take over the Ogun governorship seat in 2023 as “daydreaming, infantile fancy and political grandstanding devoid of practical reality.” DAILY POST reported Wednesday that the PDP had during a reunion of Kashamu and Adebutu factions, vowed to ‘snatch’ power from the APC in 2023. But, the APC, in a statement by its spokesperson, Tunde Oladunjoye, described the reunion as “a charade meant for photo-ops, camera lights and cheap publicity”, adding that it was “a belated cry when the head was already off”. According to Oladunjoye, the APC and Governor Dapo Abiodun would not be dragged into the 2023 electioneering yet. The ruling party stated that “the body and soul” of PDP in Ogun had left the party for APC. “The juggernauts of PDP, the well experienced politicians that really matter, are already with us in APC,” it said, noting that “those leftovers in PDP now are just some remnants clinching to the skeleton of their mutilated party.”
