DAILY POST gathered that unknown gunmen stormed the university community on Monday night attempting to abduct some students residing off the school campus. However, their operation was foiled by the joint intervention from the officers of Operation Safe Haven, Operation Rainbow, Nigeria Police, University Security and Community Watch Group. The Director of Press and Public Affairs to Governor Lalong confirmed the incident to newsmen in Jos. According to him, “on receiving the distress call, officers of Operation Safe Haven, Operation Rainbow, Nigeria Police, University Security and Community Watch Group mobilised and went after the kidnappers who had taken four students.
