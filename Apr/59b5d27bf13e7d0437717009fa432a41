Juventus boss, Andrea Pirlo, has defended his star player, Cristiano Ronaldo, after the 36-year-old threw his jersey away following their Serie A 3-1 win against Genoa on Sunday. Ronaldo was giving his Jersey to a ball boy when he threw it away at the end of Juventus’ victory over Genoa at the Allianz before he walked down the tunnel to the dressing room. It appeared that the Portugal captain had acted out of anger after failing to score against Genoa at home. Goals from Dejan Kulusevski, Alvaro Morata and Weston McKennie gave the Bianconeri all three points against the visitors, but Ronaldo grabbed the media’s attention with his reaction after the end of the encounter. Recall that Ronaldo had made headlines when he threw his captain’s armband to the ground and walked down the tunnel after seeing a goal disallowed during Portugal’s 2-2 draw against Serbia in World Cup qualifying last month. Asked about Ronaldo’s apparent anger, Pirlo defended the forward by saying that it was normal because the former Real Madrid and Manchester United star wanted to score a goal for Juve. “It’s normal he wanted to score a goal, especially seeing that the match had turned out in a certain way,” Pirlo told Sky Sport. “It is part of the attitude of champions who always want to leave their mark.” Meanwhile, despite not getting his name on the scoresheet, Ronaldo put in a strong display for Juventus. Juventus’ next game is against Atalanta on Sunday, April 18.
