A joint peaceful mass protests by parents of 39 abducted students of Federal College of Mechanization, Afaka, Kaduna, and the Coalition of Northern Groups, CNG, will hold in the next two days. The CNG spokesman, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, in a statement after a meeting with the affected parents said, “lt was agreed that a joint front for a prolonged struggle be formed to initiate sustained peaceful mass protests to force government action if the students are not rescued in the coming two days.” Worried by the prolonged inaction by government, according to the statement, the Coalition of Northern Groups, CNG, reached out to the estranged parents of the 39 students who have been abandoned in captivity for more than three weeks now. According to the statement, the CNG expressed sympathy with the parents and students of the Institute who are mainly from poor background and vowed to join their struggle for the rescue of the innocent captives. The statement said, “The CNG, in its tradition of allowing time for government action, had watched the events in the last three weeks and is convinced that the waiting is getting too long. “It was agreed at the meeting that the protests shall aim to draw attention to the uncertainty surrounding the circumstances of the poor students in captivity, while government is not forthcoming with feasible action. “It is worrisome that rather than pacify and encourage the parents and fellow students of the captives, the state government has threatened to deal with any independent alternative action to its waiting game at the expense of the students who remain exposed to unimaginable conditions for this long.”
