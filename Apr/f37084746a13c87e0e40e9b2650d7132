The Senate on Tuesday mandated its standing Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions to investigate the alleged assault on a security guard, Clement Sargwak. Recall that the CCT Chairman, Danladi Umar was criticised weeks ago for allegedly assaulting a security guard in a viral video, an accusation he has vehemently denied. Following a public backlash against Umar, Sagwak petitioned the Senate through Sen. Istifanus Gyang (Plateau North). Gyang at the plenary said the petitioner was seeking justice, given the assault on him by the Tribunal Judge, while carrying out his duty. He noted that the petitioner alleged that Umar assaulted him and asked him to kneel down and also slapped him However, President of the Senate Ahmed Lawan after much deliberation on the issue asked the committee on Ethics and privileges headed by Sen. Ayo Akinyelure to investigate the matter and report in four weeks. NAN reports that the Senate investigation was based on the fact that the petitioner was yet to seek redress in court.
