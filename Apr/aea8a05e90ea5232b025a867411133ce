Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has hailed Borussia Dortmund’s Jude Bellingham and joked the midfielder might be lying about his age. City were heading out of the Champions League on away goals after the 17-year-old scored in the 15th minute. However, Riyad Mahrez converted a penalty, before Phil Foden lashed in the winner, to see Guardiola’s men qualify for the semi-final on a 4-2 aggregate. Bellingham’s goal made him the youngest English player to score in the Champions League. “I cannot believe it, maybe he’s a liar!” Guardiola said when asked about Bellingham’s performances over the two legs. “He’s so good for 17-years-old, he’s a fantastic player. “I spoke with his manager, Edin [Terzic], and he told me what you see in these two games is like every training session.”
