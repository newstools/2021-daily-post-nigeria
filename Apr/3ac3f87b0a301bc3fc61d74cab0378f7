The All Progressives Congress, APC, has described Jegede’s suit against Akeredolu as an attempt to secure victory through the back door. This follows the dismissal of his petition by the Ondo State Election Petition Tribunal. The APC in a statement said the PDP and its candidate at the October 10, 2020 governorship election should not have towed the path they took after winning only three local governments out of the 18 local government areas of the state. The petition had earlier been struck out by the three-man tribunal over lack of jurisdiction. While advising the PDP to accept the judgment in good faith, APC in the statement issued by its Publicity Secretary, Alex Kalejaye, commended the Tribunal for its objectivity all through the trial. “Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, his running mate, Hon. Lucky Ayedatiwa and indeed all the teeming supporters of APC in Ondo State. They have all been vindicated by this sound judgment. “The party commends the Tribunal for being dispassionate and objective in considering all the arguments and counter-arguments assembled before it, while the trial lasted. “The party wonders how a candidate that scored three over 18 in an examination could expect to be declared successful, adding that “the People’s Democratic Party wanted victory through the backdoor.”
