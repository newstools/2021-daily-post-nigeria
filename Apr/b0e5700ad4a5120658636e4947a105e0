Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has urged Nigerians to commit themselves to the unity and peace of the country. The VP urged Muslims to rededicate themselves to the virtues of kindness, love, and generosity towards each other. He spoke to State House Correspondents after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting on Wednesday. “I would like to express special greetings to our Muslim brothers and sisters who have begun the Ramadan fast. “It is a time of rededication to higher values and consideration for others regardless of faith or ethnicity”, Osinbajo said. In his Ramadan message, ex-Lagos Governor, Bola Tinubu also stressed the importance of peaceful co-existence. Tinubu noted that Muslims true to the religion cannot be defeated by Nigeria’s challenges. The All Progressives Congress (APC) leader advised them to be guided in their interactions with others. He said Ramadan comes with the spirit of sacrifice, discipline and perseverance symbolised by denying the body of food and drinks. “Through this self-control and perseverance, we are moved to beneficial introspection, self-discovery and self-development. “We must do so not only for the holy month of Ramadan but every day of our lives”, the statement read. Tinubu prayed that Almighty Allah will continue to guide adherents and help them reap the spiritual benefits of the holy month.
