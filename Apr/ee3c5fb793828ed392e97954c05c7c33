President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to the killing of three students of Greenfield University by bandits operating in Kaduna State. A statement signed by Garba Shehu, the spokesman to the President, said Buhari strongly condemned the killing. According to Shehu, Buhari said the bandits, who he described as evil people, have cut down the bright youngsters in their prime. “My thoughts are with their families in this time of grief. May their souls rest in peace,” said the President. Buhari further condemned the recurring incidents of kidnappings and killings in Kaduna State in particular. Buhari, according to Shehu, said that “addressing this scourge, requires a great show of empathy and coming together as a society to squarely confront these elements and the danger it poses to our democracy and peaceful life in the country.” Buhari said that very soon bandits and their sponsors will realise sooner than later that they are bound by the same fate as their victims. “Banditry, kidnapping and the politics of murders will be fought with all the resources available to our country,” Buhari said. DAILY POST reported that the death of the three university students was confirmed by the Kaduna State Government on Friday. They were abducted and shot dead by bandits, according to the government, which added that their remains were found on Friday, in Kwanan Bature village, a location close to the university.
