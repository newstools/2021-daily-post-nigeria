The Edo Judiciary says it has suspended regular Monday court sittings in the state, in solidarity with the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria’s (JUSUN) ongoing nationwide industrial action. Recall that the JUSUN had embarked on a nationwide strike on April 6, to protest against years of financial strangulation. The industrial action was to push for the implementation of financial autonomy in the judiciary in all the 36 states and FCT. DAILY POST reported that the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) also joined the striking JUSUN in solidarity to push for financial autonomy for the judiciary. The Edo chapter of JUSUN had shunned the strike called by the national body citing a “no work, no pay” policy that cost them their salaries in 2015. The JUSUN Chairman, Edo State, Mr Uyi Ogieriakhi, explained that in 2015, when the Edo chapter joined the same strike, members were not paid their salaries by the state government. However, the Chief Registrar, Mr Benson Osawaru, in a statement on Wednesday said the Monday court sittings have been suspended in solidarity with JUSUN. “This is to notify the general public that we are in solidarity with the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) strike. “As the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Edo Branch has advised its members to boycott court on Mondays till further notice. “Consequently upon that, sitting of court in Edo State Judiciary on Mondays is hereby suspended for now,” he said.
