Tottenham Hotspur, Gareth Bale, seemed to take a swipe at former manager, Jose Mourinho, after their 2-1 win over Southampton on Wednesday. Spurs had dropped 20 points from winning positions under Mourinho, with the Portuguese criticised for his overly pragmatic approach. It was the reverse situation against the Saints under interim boss Ryan Mason, as Spurs came from behind to win. Bale, who found himself on the fringes of the team during Mourinho’s reign, netted the equaliser for Tottenham in the second half. When asked what needed to change following Mourinho’s dismissal, Bale told Sky Sports after the game: “Just to be on the front foot a bit more. We want to attack, we’re a big team, we have great players. “We need to attack more, we need to try and stay higher up the pitch. I think we did that today.”
