Former Liverpool forward, Michael Owen has criticised Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for his ‘negative’ tactics in Red Devils 0-0 draw with Leeds in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon Solskjaer’s side played out a 0-0 draw in the game that recorded just a few chances in Yorkshire. It was Manchester United’s seventh 0-0 draw of the season more than any other side in the Premier League. And Owen, also a former Manchester United striker, believes the Norwegian manager’s ‘negative’ move of playing Fred and Scott McTominay together in the midfield contributed to the disappointing draw at Elland Road. “I was disappointed with the team that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer picked,” Owen told Premier League Productions. “I thought it was quite a negative team. You’re going to a team that you’ve already beaten 6-2 in the Premier League, you don’t really need two sitting midfielders. “I thought it was a negative statement to start with.” Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani started the game on the bench, with the pair entering the fray with around 20 minutes left. Manchester United maintained their second spot on the league table despite the draw and face AS Roma in the Europa League semi-final on Thursday.
