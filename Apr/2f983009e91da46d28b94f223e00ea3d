Former Liverpool striker, Peter Crouch, has slammed the club’s players, including Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino, following the Reds’ Premier League 1-1 draw with Newcastle United at Anfield on Saturday. Mohamed Salah gave Jurgen Klopp’s side an early lead at home, but they failed to extend their lead after missing several chances. Steve Bruce’s Newcastle side grabbed a last-gasp point through Joe Willock’s deflected effort. Reacting, Crouch, who played for Liverpool between 2005-2008, said Liverpool players failed to manage the game properly, adding that they lacked composure in front of goal against Newcastle. “You could see the last ten minutes, they got nervous. After those missed chances, they didn’t manage the game at all,” Crouch said during his post-match analysis. “You kind of knew Newcastle would get back into it. You can’t keep saying they’re unlucky. There’s a nervousness in front of the goal. Salah’s got, what, 29 goals. But everyone else is not contributing enough. “Firmino looks like he’s not going to score. Mane, there’s a lack of confidence. Jota’s getting back to fitness. There’s not enough goals in midfield. “They were giving the ball away. You could hear the nervousness of the players. Everyone was frantic. “Mane hasn’t been the player he has been over the last six months. Firmino’s numbers are not strikers’ numbers. It’s an area they need to look at.”
