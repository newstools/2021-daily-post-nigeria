A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olumide Aderinokun, has said President Muhammadu Buhari was not doing enough to stop the rising cases of killings, kidnapping and banditry in Nigeria. Aderinokun, who expressed sadness over the killing of three students of Greenfield University in Kaduna by bandits, advised the Federal Government to employ Information Communication Technology (ICT) in tackling insecurity. Speaking in Abeokuta on Monday, Aderinokun maintained that “the gruesome killing of both civilians and security agents in different parts of the country is becoming more disturbing and unspeakable,” saying “the government needs to wake up.” “The President Buhari-led administration is not doing enough to tackle insecurity in the country. The killing of students, villagers, motorists and security agents is evil. It must stop now. “The Nigerian security issues are getting more disgusting. The government should look for a way to protect lives and properties of its people. Buhari is not doing enough,” he opined. He spoke further that, “It is high time we adopted international security standards by making use of ICT to fight insecurity through tracking, detecting, and disseminating information about the bandits.” The Ogun House of Representatives candidate suggested that the fight against insecurity should be reviewed urgently, adding that Buhari’s heavy investment in acquiring weapons was not enough. “The acquisition of equipment is necessary but it is evident it is insufficient to tackle the challenges of insecurity in the land. “The nature of the challenge is constantly mutating, and therefore new approaches need to be considered. We have to adopt modern technology in tackling the challenges of insecurity,” he stated, while sympathising with families of those who have died in the security challenges confronting the nation.”
