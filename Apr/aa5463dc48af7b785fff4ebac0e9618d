Posters bearing ‘Bukola Saraki for President in 2023’ have been sighted at different parts of Abuja. The campaign materials with the image of the former Senate President was captioned ‘Reset Nigeria 2023’. Saraki, a former Kwara Governor, is a chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The ex-lawmaker led the party’s presidential campaign in the last election and is currently the Chairman of the party’s Reconciliation and Strategy Committee. He joined forces with other prominent Nigerians in the All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the 2015 election but returned to the PDP before the 2019 election. Meanwhile, the PDP Youth Initiative has called for the zoning of the party’s presidential ticket to the North-Central region. The youths made the call after the congress where the Zonal Chairman, Theophilus Shan, was returned unopposed. They said their call was to “deepen democratic engagement, restore Nigeria on the path of honour and glory, and ensure that our people truly benefit from the dividends of democracy”. The group told PDP that the middle belt has produced notable men and women “who have been able to provide key leadership at crucial times since Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999″. Noting that Saraki was a good choice, they said: “He has been able to bring together all warring factions within the PDP while helping to restore sanity to the party by making sure all differences that exist are amicably resolved.”
