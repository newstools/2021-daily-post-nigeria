Manchester United goalkeeper, David de Gea, is reportedly preparing to leave Old Trafford after clashing with manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, over teammate Dean Henderson. De Gea has been Man United’s first-choice goalkeeper for nearly a decade, but the return of Henderson after his loan spell at Sheffield United last season has provided Solskjaer with a serious dilemma. Henderson started for Man United in their 2-1 win over Brighton on Sunday, but it is believed problems between De Gea and Solskjaer go much further back. The England international is currently ahead of De Gea in Solskjaer’s pecking order of keepers. According to MailSport, De Gea, who is still considered one of the best goalkeepers in Europe, is now ready to quit Man United. The 30-year-old, who currently earns £375,000-a-week, has a contract with the Red Devils until 2023. The Spain international has been linked with a move to Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and his former club Atletico Madrid in the past. De Gea will likely attract an offer in the region of £40million.
