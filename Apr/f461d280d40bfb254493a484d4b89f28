Brazilian star, Neymar told the new Barcelona board about his desire to return to Camp Nou in the summer, according to ARA. Sports journalist, Gerard Romero, also confirmed the report, adding that the Brazilian International has stopped the negotiations over his new contract with PSG. According to the report, the PSG star is well aware of Lionel Messi’s desire to remain in Barcelona. For this reason, Neymar, who left Barcelona a few years in a world-record transfer, wants to return to Camp Nou. The 29-year-old forward has scored 13 goals and provided 5 assists for PSG in 19 appearances this season. Recall that Neymar’s former agent, Andrea Cury, had hinted that the Brazilian forward will play with Messi again at Barcelona. There are rumours about Messi moving over to PSG having refused to sign a new contract but Cury had maintained that Neymar will be the one moving to Barcelona instead. Cury, Neymar’s former agent, is backing Barcelona new President, Joan Laporta to arrange a reunion for the pair at Camp Nou.
