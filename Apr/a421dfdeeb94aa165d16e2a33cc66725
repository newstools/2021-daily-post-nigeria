Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel insists he has not spoken to the club’s owner, Roman Abramovich, since being appointed the Blues coach. He also confirmed that he has not received an apology from Abramovich over the failed European Super League. Tuchel replaced Frank Lampard at Stamford Bridge last January after the Englishman was sacked by Abramovich. “Nobody needs to apologise (to me),” Tuchel said in a press conference on Friday ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash with West Ham on Saturday. “I haven’t spoken to the owner [Roman Abramovich] since I arrived. I’ve spoken to the club before and after the match. I was told we were pulling out, and that was all I needed to prepare for the next match against West Ham. “It’s the owner’s club. It’s not my club. I am part of the club. It’s the club’s decision, and now they’ve changed. So there’s no need to apologise to me. “We were distracted, yeah (against Brighton during the week) because otherwise, it wouldn’t have made sense to focus on games. Me, personally, I arrived in a state of mind on Tuesday with not the usual mindset I arrive for a match. “It’s in the past now. Like I said, I don’t think they need to apologise to me.”
