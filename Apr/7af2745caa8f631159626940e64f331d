Paris Saint-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has heaped praises on his players, including Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, for their “enormous sacrifice” after beating Bayern Munich 3-2 in the Champions League quarter-final first-leg tie on Wednesday night in Germany. Mbappe opened the scoring for PSG before Marquinhos made it 2-0 for the visitors, thanks to Neymar’s assists. However, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Thomas Muller then equalized for Bayern before Mbappe netted again to give Pochottino’s men a first-leg advantage ahead of the return leg next week. “I am happy with the result and the attitude of the team, who found themselves in difficult situations against the best side in Europe,” Pochettino said at his post-match press conference after the game. “We need to congratulate the players for their enormous sacrifice, and we want to repeat this kind of performance. “When you win, it’s always easier to explain your decisions, everyone thinks you made the right choices. “The credit goes to the players, they are the main protagonists. It is their quality that must be highlighted.” “Ninety more minutes to play. It is a good result, but the return leg will be difficult. We know that,” Pochettino added.
