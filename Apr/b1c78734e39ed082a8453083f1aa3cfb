Former Chelsea winger, Joe Cole, has said that his old club would prefer to face Real Madrid in the semi-finals of the Champions League rather than Liverpool. Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea boss had earlier shared a similar opinion, insisting that he would not want his side to face a club from the same league in the semi-finals of the Champions League. The Blues made it to the semi-finals of Europe’s premier competition on Tuesday night despite a 1-0 defeat to Porto. Mehdi Taremi scored a remarkable overhead kick for Porto in the final minutes but it wasn’t enough to overturn a two-goal deficit for the Portuguese side. The Stamford Bridge landlords now awaits either Real Madrid or Liverpool in the semi-finals, with the La Liga giants holding a 3-1 lead over the Reds. And Cole, who also played for Liverpool believes the Blues will be hoping for Real Madrid to come out victorious on Wednesday night. “Business-like performance and you’d take Real Madrid in the semi-finals over Liverpool,” he told BT Sport. “I think Real Madrid have fallen a long way.”
