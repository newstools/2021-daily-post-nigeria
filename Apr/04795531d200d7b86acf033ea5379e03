Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has defended his team selection following a 1-0 defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. Following their 2-1 win at Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, Guardiola rang the changes for the game against the Blues. The Spaniard made eight changes with the likes of Raheem Sterling and Ferran Torres starting at Wembley. Stand-in goalkeeper, Zack Steffen, was at fault for what turned out to be the decisive goal from Hakim Ziyech 10 minutes into the second period. Guardiola admitted that Chelsea deserved their victory, but refused to blame his selection. “When you have two-and-a-half days to recover and you have to play away and travel for longer than three hours, everyone deserves to play. “But don’t say we don’t pay attention. The team arrives in the final stages of all competitions, you couldn’t say that. When this team won three or four finals in a row in the Carabao Cup. Just say we lost the game. When you lose the game the decisions are bad, but it is a poor argument, my friend. It’s so poor. “It was a tight game, we were not able to win, congratulations to Chelsea, Chelsea’s a top side.”
