Leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has vowed never to back down on the struggle for Biafra freedom. Kanu said he had sacrificed his parents for the Biafran agitation and was ready to do more for the struggle. Kanu stated this on Saturday evening through an inscription on an image he tweeted on his official Twitter handle which also indicated the date and time for his usual live radio program on Biafra radio. “The inscription reads: I sacrificed my mother and father to get Biafra. I will sacrifice everything”. Meanwhile, in a separate tweet, Kanu while reacting to a publication by an online news platform that reported “seven military officers arrested for supporting bandits”, said he earlier predicted it. “I’ve been telling you this for long: BokoHaram, Fulani Herdsmen & ISWAP have infiltrated the Nigerian Armed Forces. “And as TY Danjuma had said, if you don’t defend yourselves, you will all die one by one”, he added.
