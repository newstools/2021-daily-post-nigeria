Derek Chauvin, the officer charged with the murder of George Floyd, has been found guilty. The jury, at the trial in Minneapolis, adjudged he was guilty on all three counts. They are unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter Bail was revoked and Chauvin was returned to the custody of the county sheriff. In transcripts of police body camera footage that shook the world in May 2020, Floyd said: “You’re going to kill me, man”. Chauvin, who was kneeling on his neck, replied: “Then stop talking, stop yelling, it takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk.” The transcripts confirmed that Floyd told officers that he could not breathe more than 20 times. Ex-officer Thomas Lane had insisted he should not be held accountable for the killing because it was his fourth day on the job. Lane said he only followed orders from Chauvin, who had 19 years of experience. The transcript showed that he asked other officers to turn Floyd onto his side. Chauvin, with his knee pinned on Floyd’s neck, says “no, he‘s staying put where we got him.” The murder made the #BlackLivesMatter campaign spread further globally. In 2020, it was the second-most popular hashtag after #COVID19, according to Twitter.
