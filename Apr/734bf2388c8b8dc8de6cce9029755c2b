Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said there are three players in his squad that can’t be challenged. The German named Mateo Kovacic, Antonio Rudiger and Cesar Azpilicueta as his top fighters. The Blues are preparing for a crucial week in their campaign, as they take on FC Porto in the Champions League quarter-final, having won 2-0 in the first leg. Four days later, Tuchel’s men will face Manchester City in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Ahead of the key games, Tuchel has spoken about some of the players he will rely on to protect their teammates and praised the squad’s spirit. “Honestly you don’t want to be in a fight with Antonio Rudiger, Kova (Mateo Kovacic) and Azpi (Cesar Azpilicueta). “For me, you don’t want to be in a fight with them, because they are ready to fight and it’s their nature to show it on the pitch and protect the interests of our team. “They are there, we can rely on them, nobody has to do stuff which is against their nature, you can totally rely on them,” Tuchel said.
