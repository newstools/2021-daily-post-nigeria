It’s the first time Chelsea have reached the semi-final stage since 2014 when Atlético Madrid beat them. The Premier League giants will face either Real Madrid or Liverpool in the Champions League last four later this month. Reacting, Drogba, who was part of the 2012 triumph in Munich, and Fabregas both took to their Twitter accounts to react to the Blues progress into the semi-finals. Drogba wrote, “Slowly but surely”, while Fabregas responded with clapping and party emojis as he continued to show support to his former club. Meanwhile, Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, described Chelsea’s qualification for the semi-final as a big achievement. Tuchel said at his post-match press conference, “It is a very big achievement. You see when Chelsea was last in the semi-final. We are not used to being there. Once you are there, you play for the final. This is clear.”
