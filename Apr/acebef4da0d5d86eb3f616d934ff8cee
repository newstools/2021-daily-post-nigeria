Apostle Paul Okikijesu of the Christ Apostolic Miracle Ministry has claimed that God revealed to him that the Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba and the Minister of Defence, Retired General Bashir Salihi Magashi may be removed from their positions. “Thus says the Lord: They may bring charges against the Inspector General of Police and he may be removed from office,” Okikijesu said in a statement to DAILY POST on Thursday. He called on the new Inspector General of Police to resist coercion that can ruin the police force. “Baba must not allow people to push him in a manner that will ruin the name of the police force in future. If he turns a deaf ear to this voice; the people who are investigating him will bring charges against him, and he will be removed from office.” Speaking on the Minister of Defence, Magashi, Okikijesu added, “Thus says the Lord: Magashi should not listen to the advice of people to waste lives. He should be prayerful. “The Minister of Defense should be cautious; so that something that he underestimated will not cause his downfall, and hurt/harm his life. “If he honors humans and the carnal things of this world; he will be entrapped, in a manner that will make him to be removed from office. “Some people are setting traps for Magashi, in order to use his body/health to bind him. This sickness will make it impossible for him to continue in office; then another person will be appointed to the post, to replace him.”
