Three persons who were earlier kidnapped along Siun/Ajura road in Ogere-Remo axis of Ogun State have been rescued by the police. The three victims, Mr Jibril Afolabi, Alhaji Amusat Taofeek, and Ms Balikis Mohammed, were reportedly coming from Ilorin, the Kwara State capital. Their vehicle was heading for Owode Egbado, when it was double-crossed at about 3am Friday, by some unknown gunmen, who dragged the victims into the bush as other passengers escaped. As he received the information, the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun had directed the Sagamu Area Commander to mobilize men from all divisions within the area to embark on a search for the victims and to go after the hoodlums. He equally ordered the command’s anti-kidnapping unit as well as SWAT to move to the scene. A statement by Abimbola Oyeyemi, the State Police Public Relations Officer, said the entire bush was cordoned off, combed thoroughly with the assistance of hunters, local vigilantes and men of the state So-Safe Corps. “The heat on them made them abandon the victims and took to flight,” Oyeyemi told DAILY POST, adding that all the victims were rescued without any ransom paid. “They have been escorted to their destination at Owode Egbado,” Oyeyemi concluded.
