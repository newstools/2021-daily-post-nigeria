Erling Haaland’s father, Alf-Inge, and his agent Mino Raiola flew to Barcelona on Thursday to hold talks with Barca president Joan Laporta over a possible transfer for the Borussia Dortmund striker, ESPN reports. The two-and-a-half-hour meeting which also had Barca’s incoming Director of Football, Mateu Alemany, was the first step to exploring the viability of a deal. It is understood that Dortmund are aware of the meeting and it is expected that more clubs will seek to discuss a transfer with the player. Haaland similarly held talks with interested clubs including Manchester United, before joining Dortmund from FC Salzburg in January 2020. Dortmund’s Sporting Director, Michael Zorc said later on Thursday: “I don’t have anything against [Mino Raiola and Alf-Inge Haaland] taking in the sun on the Mediterranean. “We’ve talked and our stance is quite clear. I am very, very relaxed in that matter because I know what we want.” Haaland, 20, has netted 49 goals in as many games for Borussia Dortmund and the club would accept €180m for him this summer.
