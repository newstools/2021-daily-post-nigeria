Two suspected armed robbers have been arrested for allegedly dispossessing one Nonso Nwibo, a rice merchant of a cash sum of N120,000 at Ipamesan area of Sango/Ota, Ogun State. The Ogun Police Spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, informed DAILY POST on Tuesday that the suspects were arrested following a distress call received by the DPO of Sango/Ota division, CSP Godwin Idehai. Idehai was told that robbers had invaded the shop of the said Nonso and robbed him of his money as well as his Tecno phone at gunpoint. The DPO was said to have quickly led his men to the scene, “but on sighting the policemen, the robbers took to flight, but they were hotly chased and one of them, Sadiq Hassan, was arrested with a locally made pistol while the other one escaped,” Oyeyemi has said. Following a diligent investigation, the second suspect, Kudus Rasak, was reportedly apprehended on April 19, at a hideout in Owode Ijako, with a live cartridge recovered from him. The two suspects, according to the police, had confessed to being the ones who robbed Nonso of his valuables. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the state CIID for investigations.
