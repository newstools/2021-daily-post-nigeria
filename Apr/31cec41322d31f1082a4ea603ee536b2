The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has confirmed candidates can no longer use email for the processing of registration for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE). JAMB registrar, Prof Is-haq Oloyede, stated this while speaking with journalists on Tuesday evening. According to Oloyede, email would only be needed at the successful completion of the registration exercise by candidates to access information on the examination. He said, “As from Thursday, April 15, 2021, candidates will no longer be required to provide any email address during registration.” Candidates can either use the mobile app to access their profile during or after registration. They can also send the word email (space then the email address) on his /her registered phone to 55019. He added that a candidate’s mobile phone now remains the only major tool to carry out all the registration processes.
