Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, has lamented the ethnic tension in Nigeria caused by non-state actors but expressed confidence that the country could move forward if its leaders continue to drive economic empowerment for the people by providing infrastructure for them. Governor Makinde who made the assertion in Bauchi during a visit said it was a tough period in the annals of Nigeria, while some leaders look away as if they do not know what was going on. “This is a tough period in the life of our country. This is a period where we have non-state actors all over the place forming ethnic tension and some leaders looking away as if they do not know what is going on,” Makinde said. The Oyo State helmsman said he was convinced that leaders could succeed in moving Nigeria forward if they continue to economically empower the citizens by providing infrastructure that the people needed, declaring that Nigerians are resilient people who need the right environment to flourish. “As leaders, we must never forget that what we do with the opportunity we are given will eventually speak for us. We must remain focused on doing the right thing to the best of our abilities. “We must work to accelerate development in our areas and road construction is one of those core development projects that must never be overlooked,” he said.
