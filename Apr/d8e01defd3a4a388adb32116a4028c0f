Thiago Alcantara has revealed what makes Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola different from other football tacticians. The Spaniard opened up on being managed by Klopp and Guardiola and explained what ‘sets them apart’ from other managers. Thiago played under Guardiola at Barcelona, and won two La Liga titles and the Champions League. Both of them then proceeded to work together at Bundesliga side, Bayern Munich until the gaffer moved to Manchester City in 2016. After a successful spell at Bayern, Thiago made the switch to Liverpool last summer and has relished the opportunity to work under Klopp. Klopp guided Borussia Dortmund to two Bundesliga titles and has won the Premier League and Champions League with Liverpool. And Thiago believes that Guardiola Klopp’s ability to implement their own unique tactical approaches and get players on board is what distinguishes them from the rest. He told ESPN Brasil, “I will always speak positive things in an open way. What sets these two coaches apart is the idea of ​​having a game methodology and knowing how to pass it on to the players. “The players, in addition to listening and having that respect, do what the coach wants. “This was the most important part of the stage that I lived with Guardiola and that I am living with Klopp.”
