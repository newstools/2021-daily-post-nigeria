Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has admitted that the team depends too heavily on Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka. However, Arteta is hoping the Gunners can find a way to win when the two youngsters are rested. The Gunners’ record with Saka and Smith Rowe on the pitch, is much better to when they are left out of the starting XI. But with fixtures coming thick and fast, Arteta ahead of Sunday’s game against Fulham, is keen to avoid burnout and has called on the rest of the squad to step up in their potential absence. “They know that playing every game is impossible, so we have to change those stats. “That’s what we have to do. We have to find that solution. “It tells a lot about what has happened this season. Eight months ago, if anybody had said we were going to rely so much on these two guys to get a result, you would have said we were not going to be in a strong position. “That is our reality as well. We have to change that reality because it doesn’t go in our favour,” Arteta said of his team’s reliance on the pair.
