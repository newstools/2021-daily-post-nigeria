There was a serious tension on Wednesday afternoon at Wanke weekly market in Gusau Local Government Area of Zamfara State as some members of the outlawed Yansakai group stormed the market and allegedly killed three herdsmen. An eyewitness who was at the market but declined giving his name for security reason told DAILY POST that some members of the outlawed Yansakai group invaded the market around 1:00pm and whisked a suspected bandit and gruesomely killed him inside open market. “While that action lasted, another set of the outlawed Yansakai group came and whisked away another two suspected Fulani herdsmen and also killed them,” he said. He said what brought about the tension in the market was that the rest of the Fulani herdsmen around the scene of the incident gathered at the outskirts of the market and began to make suspicious phone calls probably to attract the attention of the unrepentant Fulani bandits for reprisal attacks. According to him, the phone calls scared many people in the market who suspected that the Fulanis were remobilizing bandits for reinforcement. “By 2;30pm, the market was completely deserted as many traders parked their belongings and hurriedly left the town as there was no single security operative to quell the dastard act in the market. The source also confirmed that the soldiers attached to Magami also came. but after the deed had been done, asked everyone to leave and even began to shoot into the air. But the Police command’s Spokesman, SP Mohammed Shehu could not take his phone after several calls by our correspondents in Gusau, the State capital.
