Days after Resident Doctors embarked on a nationwide industrial action, Nigerian judiciary workers have announced their plans to join suit. The Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) declared that the indefinite action will commence after the Easter holiday. A circular issued on Saturday ordered the closure of courts across the country from Tuesday, April 6. The communication signed by JUSUN’s General Secretary, I. M. Adetola, copied all states and zonal heads of the union. JUSUN recalled that at its last national meeting on March 13, in Abuja, a 21-day deadline was issued to the government. The union is demanding the immediate implementation of financial autonomy for the judiciary. “As a result of the public holiday on April 5, 2021, the strike action has been postponed to Tuesday, April 6, 2021. “You are directed to shut down courts and departments in your states until further notice from the National Secretariat of JUSUN in Abuja,” the circular read.
