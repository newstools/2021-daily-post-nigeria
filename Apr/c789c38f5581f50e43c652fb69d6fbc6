American rapper, Cardi B has reacted to the 90-day jail sentence handed to Ghanaian actress Akuapem Poloo over a nude photoshoot she had with her underage son. Recall that the actress had shared a nude picture with her son on her social media platforms in June 2020 to celebrate his son’s seventh year birthday. She was condemned for the post while the Director of Child Rights International Ghana, Bright Appiah, filed a petition seeking her prosecution. Following the development, DAILY POST on Friday reported that Poloo, was sentenced to three months in prison for posting nude pictures online. Reacting, Cardi B in a tweet via her handle said she believes Akuapem Poloo should not have been imprisoned adding that the jail term was harsh. She further stated that a social media probation or community service would have been a better option. “I have seen a lot of Americans do photoshoots like that. “Even though it’s not my style I don’t think she had a sexual motive around the photo. “In honesty, I also think jail is a bit harsh. Maybe social media probation or community service would have been better,” she said.
