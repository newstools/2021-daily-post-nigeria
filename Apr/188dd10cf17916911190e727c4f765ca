Former Senator and Founder of Silverbird Group, Ben Murray Bruce has once again called for a ban on all combustible engine cars by 2035. He asked the federal government to ensure a total ban by 2035. Ben Bruce made the call when he announced his order for 2 Lucid Electric cars. He made this known via a twitter post on Saturday. Ben Bruce has been vocal on his opposition to continuous reliance on fossil fuel. As a Senator, he sponsored a bill for the ban of fossil powered vehicles. He added that the Lucid Car is better than Tesla. “In practising what I preach, I recently put a deposit on this yet to be manufactured Lucid Electric Car. Delivery is early next year. It’s capable of more miles per charge than a Tesla. An amazing machine. Nigeria should ban all combustion Engine cars by 2035,” he said. However, reactions to the post are not supportive of the idea. Several commentators faulted the call for ban. @TMbanche twitted, “I am an advocate of EV but saying Nigeria should ban Gasoline cars iñ the future is not realistic enough, how many Nigerians can afford EV? Most of EVs are brand new while majority of our population don’t have the financial nerve to afford brand new cars. Let the compete period.” @Made_in_ND also tweeted “This is pure wickedness Where are the roads to ride on? Are you aware they are a thousands of youth in the Niger Delta region that lack education and jobs? “Let me ask you, how many companies/Establishments and empowerment programs have you put on ground? This is a same.” This is coming in the wake of federal government’s plan to invest $1.5billion on the Port Harcourt refinery and Dangote group about to deliver the Dangote refinery in Lagos.
