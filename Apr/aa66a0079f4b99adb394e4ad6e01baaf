The Governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu has waded into the uncertainties surrounding Enyimba FC’s involvement in the CAF Confederation Cup fixture against Al Ahly Benghazi in Libya. The People’s Elephant were at risk of missing the group A fixture in Libya as a result of flight and visa complications in the requirements for entry into Libya. The chances of Nigeria’s only representative in the CAF Confederation Cup suffered a further blow when CAF turned down their initial request for postponement of the game. However, Governor Ikpeazu has stepped in at the most crucial moment by making provisions for a chartered flight to convey the team to and from Libya. With the governor’s intervention, the team is now scheduled to jet out of the country on Tuesday night to honour the matchday five-fixture, which is now scheduled for 10pm on Thursday, April 22. Reacting to the gesture, Chairman Enyimba Fc, Felix Anyansi Agwu commended Governor Ikpeazu for his intervention adding that the governor’s benevolence has averted what could have brought embarrassment and ridicule, not just to Enyimba Fc but to Nigeria as a country. He said, “I am deeply grateful to the governor for this very kind and generous gesture. “The timely manner in which he intervened in the matter is a clear indication that he has Enyimba at the centre of his heart, and God will continue to bless him. “I also want to thank the Nigeria Football Federation NFF, President, Amaju Pinnick for the role he played in ensuring that we are now at this point where we are sure of playing the match in a convenient atmosphere. He took it upon himself to ensure that everything is fine for us to honour the match, and we are very grateful to him.” Enyimba is second in group A with six points from four matches, two points behind leaders Orlando Pirates who the People’s Elephant will face on the final matchday.
