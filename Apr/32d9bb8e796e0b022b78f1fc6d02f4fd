Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder, Jamie Redknapp, has claimed that Jose Mourinho wouldn’t have made much difference to the club’s Carabao Cup chances had he still been in charge for Sunday’s final defeat to Manchester City. Mourinho’s sacking as Tottenham manager caused shockwaves not because his removal was unexpected, but because he was dismissed just six days before Spurs’ Carabao Cup final against the Premier League leaders. Ryan Mason took over from Mourinho and was in charge as Man City defeated Tottenham 1-0 in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley, thanks to Aymeric Laporte’s second-half goal. But Redknapp insisted that Mason’s predecessor Mourinho would have been no more likely to mastermind victory despite the fact he remains the only manager to have got the better of Man City coach, Pep Guardiola, in a final. “I think everyone will say: ‘Would Jose have a difference if he was here for this game?’, but it didn’t have a different feel to when they played at the Etihad a couple of months ago,” Redknapp told Sky Sports. “There was a gulf in class then, and I think it was pretty much the same.” “You have to be so careful because we all believe in a philosophy,” Redknapp added. “You want to play out from the back, but if a team is pressing you and they get success with it, and they can’t get out, there has to be a time, even as a player where you accept this isn’t working. “Then you go to the halfway line, try to turn them and get down the sides, a little bit like Chelsea did last week.”
