Following the recent attack on Abagena village in Makurdi Local Government Area of Benue State by suspected Fulani herdsmen on Monday night, youths in the area have vowed to take up arms for self-defence. DAILY POST had reported that suspected Fulani herdsmen invaded the village at about noon Monday killing no fewer than 7 persons as scores sustained varying degrees of injuries. Angered by the repeated incident in the community, the youths in the village blocked the Lafia/Makurdi road on Tuesday morning demanding justice from governments. Addressing newsmen during the protest, the president of the community youths who identified himself as Mr Amos, said they must be allowed to bear arms. “President Muhammadu Buhari must allow us to use the AK-47 the same way the Fulani herdsmen are allowed. “Yesterday we saw them and they were speaking Fulani while attacking us. They are not armed bandits. “They aimed to attack the IDP camp but their attempt was foiled by the neighbouring villagers. “About 20 persons were killed and scores are currently receiving treatment in the hospital”, he said.
