Porto head coach, Sergio Conceicao, has accused Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, of insulting him during his side’s Champions League quarter-final second-leg 1-0 victory against the Blues on Tuesday in Spain. Conceicao made the claims shortly after Porto crashed out of the Champions League on a 2-1 aggregate on Tuesday night, having lost 2-0 in the first-leg last week. The 46-year-old appeared to take issues with Tuchel after both managers had fist-bumped at full-time. The Portuguese coach could be seen speaking to the fourth official, as well as his own players, who then became angry with Tuchel. Porto defender, Pepe could also be seen confronting Tuchel, and the pair had to be separated by one of the officials. Speaking after the game, Conceicao confirmed to reporters at his post-match press conference that he had been insulted by Tuchel. “I was insulted by this man [Thomas Tuchel] who is next door,” Conceicao said. “I told the referee that the fourth referee heard the insults. “My English is not perfect, there is no point in talking about it. There was no exchange of words because I was focused on the game.I don’t know why he reacted. “But I didn’t understand it very well. I heard some insults, but it’s gone … it’s not pretty, and my irritation, in the end, had to do with it. I didn’t even speak to him.”
