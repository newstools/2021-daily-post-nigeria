A middle-aged man has killed an Okada rider in Ondo State following a plan to snatch a motorcycle from his victim. The 32-year-old culprit, Sunday Ayenutaju committed the crime at Omin-nla within Ore axis in Odigbo Local Government Area of the State. Ayenitaju who conspired with his friend to commit the crime was arrested by men of the Ondo State Security Network Agency, otherwise known as Amotekun. Luck was said to have ran out of them after the duo killed the unidentified victim when the Amotekun operatives swooped on them. With his friend escaping from the scene, Sunday told the corps that it was his friend who lured him into the evil act. “My childhood friend, who is popularly known as ‘Akaba’ invited me to join him in snatching Okada in Ore. He told me he had been in the business for a very long time, and it’s lucrative. He showed me over 60 bikes he had acquired and asked me to join him. Although he has been inviting me for a very long time, I refused.” Describing the incident as pathetic, the Commander of the corps, Adetunji Adeleye, urged everyone in the state to be security conscious, especially in this festive period.
