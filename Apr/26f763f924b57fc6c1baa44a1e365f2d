Jose Mourinho has been fired as manager of Tottenham Hotspur on Monday morning. Mourinho took charge of the Premier League side in November 2019 replacing Mauricio Pochettino. The former Chelsea and Manchester United boss penned a deal until the end of the 2023 season. In his first campaign, Mourinho took Spurs from 14th in the Premier League to finish sixth, securing Europa League qualification. However, they were knocked out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage by RB Leipzig. Spurs are currently seventh in the table, five points off the Champions League places and play Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday.
