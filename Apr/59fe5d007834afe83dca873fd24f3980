President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated with ex-National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Adams Oshiomhole on his 69th birthday. The Nigerian leader advised the former Edo Governor to rededicate his life to working for the prosperity of those in need. Buhari’s message was issued on Sunday by his spokesman, Garba Shehu. He joined Oshiomhole’s family and well-wishers to thank God for a life of service to the nation, good health and opportunity to commemorate the special day. The President hailed Oshiomhole for building bridges among people of diverse backgrounds, inspiring others to be patriotic, eschewing politics of division and acrimony. He recognised the politician’s immense contributions to Nigeria and wished him “more years of service to build a better country”.
