Senator Obinna Ogba (PDP-Ebonyi Central) says recent killings in Ebonyi and the other South Eastern States will not deter the zone from producing the next President of the country. Ogba said this while answering questions from newsmen on a motion he presented earlier at plenary on Wednesday. The motion was titled: “Incessant Killings in Ebonyi”. Ogba claims the crisis cannot stop the southeast from producing the President, noting that there has been insecurity in other parts of the country but that didn’t stop them from seeking presidential positions. ”This cannot be an excuse for denying us from producing the President of Igbo extraction for this country, it cannot. “So let nobody hide under the security situation; it is the turn of the southeast,” he said. Earlier in his motion, Ogba raised concerns over the degenerating state of insecurity in the country, which, he said, was widespread in most parts. He said there was an urgent need for intervention by the Federal Government to arrest the senseless killings and destruction of property.
