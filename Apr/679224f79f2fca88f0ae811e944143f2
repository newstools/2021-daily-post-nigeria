Manchester United is in advanced talks to sign Raphael Varane from Real Madrid, the El Chiringuito TV reports. The Red Devils have been linked with Varane for some time, with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a big fan of the French defender. Solskjaer is in the market for a perfect player to partner captain Harry Maguire. Varane is out of contract in the summer of 2022 and there has been no talk of him penning a new contract at the Bernabeu. Real Madrid will have to sell him this summer and risk losing him for free next year. Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane has reportedly softened to the idea of selling Varane as a result.
