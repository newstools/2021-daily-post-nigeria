The United Nations (UN) has suspended operations in Damasak and Dikwa in Borno State over terror attack. The Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, said he was deeply concerned about the incidents that affected humanitarian assets and personnel. “We have temporarily suspended operations in these areas in order to safely relocate humanitarian staff and are closely monitoring the situation”, he said in a statement on Saturday. The official condemned the attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure which may constitute violations on International Humanitarian Law. Kallon assured that the UN intend to resume operations as soon as possible, so that civilians affected by the conflict will continue to receive the assistance they need. Last weekend, the UN confirmed that three international aid partners’ facilities were directly targeted and damaged. About 8,800 Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs, and 76,000 people in the host community have been affected. The global body urged donors and stakeholders to support in funding the nine humanitarian hubs and the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS).
