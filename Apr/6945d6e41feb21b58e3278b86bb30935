The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has declared that women will play a vital role in actualizing Yoruba nation. Ogunwusi said the agitation for self-determination would be successful with the support of women. The monarch spoke yesterday at his palace in Ile-Ife, Osun State, while hosting some women under the aegis of Obinrin Oodua Agbaye. According to Ooni: “Women are not timid, they are warriors. From the Holy Bible, we read how Deborah fought for her people and conquered. “Moremi fought and delivered the people of Ancient Ife from the Igbomekun who were our deadly adversaries. “Therefore, women are key to our struggle for self-determination and we must carry them along, going forward. “Again, I want to say very expressly that If we fail to have the support of our women folks, we are going nowhere. “Therefore, I welcome you to the source and I wish you well in your visit to other palaces in Yoruba Nation.” Lately, Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemi popularly known as Igboho has been advocating for Oduduwa Republic’s actualization. As parts of the effort towards actualizing the Oduduwa Republic, a security outfit was launched in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The security outfit named Oduduwa Nation Security Force was Code named “Operation Paramole’.
