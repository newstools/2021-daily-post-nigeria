Aisha Yesufu, a right activist popular with the Bring Back Our Girl BBOG, campaign, has reminded pro-Buhari protesters that President Muhammadu Buhari did not go to London to pray. DAILY POST reported on Monday that Buhari’s supporters stormed the Abuja House in London where the Nigerian leader is said to be going through a routine medical check-up with placards praying for the President. It was a counter-rally, in the wake of a protest by an anti-Buhari group led by Reno Omokri, a former presidential aide at the same venue. Recall that Buhari had departed Nigeria on Tuesday to the UK for a medical check-up. However, Aisha reminded the pro-Buhari protesters that the President had abandoned the poor healthcare system in his country and travelled abroad to get treated in a good healthcare system built by people like him. “Buhari did not go to the UK for prayers. He went for medical treatment & he is getting it from the healthcare system built by people like him in their country. “The healthcare system wasn’t built by prayers but by using the greatest miracle God gave humans: BRAINS plus a dose of empathy,” she tweeted.
