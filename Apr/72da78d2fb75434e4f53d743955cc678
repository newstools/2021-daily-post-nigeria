Bayern Munich manager, Hansi Flick, has expressed his belief that Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, “will win the Ballon d’Or one day”. Mbappe inspired his team to a 3-2 victory over Bayern last week, scoring twice in their Champions League quarter-final tie. Ahead of the second leg this week, Flick said the France international is well on his way to becoming the best player in Europe. “He will win the Ballon d’Or one day, I am absolutely convinced of that. He has everything,” the Bayern boss said at a pre-match press conference. “He is fast, he has a good technique and – what is most important – he scores a lot of goals.” Mbappe is already making a strong claim to win his first Ballon d’Or this year, as the 22-year-old took his tally in the Champions League to eight goals in eight matches after his brace against Bayern and has scored another 25 in domestic competitions this term, including 21 in Ligue 1.
