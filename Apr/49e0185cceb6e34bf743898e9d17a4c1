The Chief Fire Officer in Oyo State, Mr Moshood Adewuyi when contacted, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST on Tuesday. Adewuyi told DAILY POST that a wing in the plank market was affected. He, however, said that he cannot quantify the worth of the property destroyed now. “Yes. There was a fire incident at plank market in Bodija on Monday. “I cannot quantify the worth now. I can’t say that this is the total number of shops affected. But, it is a wing in the market that was affected. “Our men did not allow the whole wing to be destroyed before they quenched the fire. They did not allow it to spread,” he said.
