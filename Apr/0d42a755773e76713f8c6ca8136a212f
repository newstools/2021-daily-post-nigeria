Arsenal star, Mohamed Elneny, has taken a veiled swipe at the club’s former manager, Unai Emery, ahead of the Gunners’ UEFA Europa League semi-final tie with Villarreal on April 29. Elneny said he is now happy at Emirates under current Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, adding that Emery didn’t give him a chance to play. The midfielder made 17 appearances in all competitions during Emery’s regime at Emirates. The 28-year-old was loaned out to Besiktas last season but was offered an opportunity to resurrect his Arsenal career at the start of the current campaign under Arteta. “If you are good, you will play, if you are not good, you will be on the bench, or you will be out of the squad,” Elneny told Sky Sports. “This is what I love from Mikel Arteta because it is fair. If you train good and you train hard, and you are ready to play, he will give you a chance to play. “This is what I missed before with Emery. He wasn’t giving me a chance to play, and that’s why I get a chance to go to Turkey and prove myself, and I come back, and I’m happy about myself now.”
