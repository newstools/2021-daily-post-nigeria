Former Germany head coach, Jurgen Klinsmann, has said he was sorry for Timo Werner after the Chelsea striker’s huge miss in his country’s 2-1 home shock defeat against North Macedonia in a World Cup qualifier on Wednesday night. Werner had missed a huge opportunity to score for Germany in Macedonia’s penalty area after receiving a cross pass from Manchester City’s Ilkay Gundogan in the second half during the match. However, goals from Goran Pandev and Eljif Elmas ensured North Macedonia defeated Germany at the MSV-Arena Stadium as Gundogan’s second-half penalty goal was not enough for the host. Reacting to Werner’s miss after the game, Klinsmann told ESPN, “This is a situation where you can clearly see he has two or three things in his mind – and in those moments you are not executing,” “He was nervous when he got that ball. He knows he has to put it in. He would do that 99 per cent of the time. But at that moment, he just overthought the situation and missed it. “When you miss a chance, then, obviously, he will be angry with himself, and he probably won’t sleep tonight. “He already has a tough situation at Chelsea, so you feel for him. You really feel for him.” Klinsmann added: “It was a huge, huge surprise. Nobody expected that. The way the game started, I thought it would be comfortable for Germany. “But they didn’t take their chances. You get punished if you don’t take your chances and invite them to take their chances. North Macedonia played well and believed in themselves, but this is a huge surprise and a huge disappointment for Germany.” The result against North Macedonia means Germany’s 35-game unbeaten run in World Cup qualifying since 2001 when they lost 5-1 against England is now over.
