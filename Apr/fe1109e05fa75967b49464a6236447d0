He also admitted sending Wande Coal several DMs to return. “I believe a lot of people in the industry at the time were saying things to Wande Coal which eventually led to his final decision. “I also believed Wande Coal had gotten to the stage where he felt he could take the reins of his career. “I did not want him to leave and begged for him to return to Mavin,” Don Jazzy said.
