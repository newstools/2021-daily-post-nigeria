Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez has claimed that the Chelsea fans who protested the club’s European Super League plans outside Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night were planted. Perez also claimed he knows who took the fans to Stamford Bridge to stage the protest. A significant number of Chelsea fans had on Tuesday blocked the team bus’ entrance to Stamford Bridge in protest after the club signed up for the controversial European Super League. Shortly after the protest, Chelsea withdrew their membership in the breakaway Champions League competition. All six Premier League clubs have now withdrawn but neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona have pulled out. But Perez is not giving up on the proposals, suggesting instead that they can be tweaked. The Real Madrid chief claimes the numbers at the protest outside Stamford Bridge was vastly overstated adding that the protesters were not Chelsea fans and were instead planted “Chelsea fans at Stamford Bridge are the same people who put those anti-Super League shirts on Cadiz tonight,” he said after Real Madrid’s 3-0 win at Cadiz on Wednesday. Cadiz players wore t-shirts protesting against the European Super League plans, Perez added, “Chelsea fans? They were 40 people outside Stamford Bridge… and if you want, I will tell you who took them there. “The Super League is not dead. It’s on standby and we’ll work on the project. All 12 founder clubs signed the same contract.”
