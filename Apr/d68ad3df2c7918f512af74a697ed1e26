The Kwara State House of Assembly, on Tuesday, decried the high cost of foodstuff in the state. Hon. Abdullahi Halidu Danbaba, who moved the motion on the need to control the high cost of foodstuffs in the state, expressed concern that the rate of food scarcity, particularly in Kwara, has brought about an increased level of hunger and starvation in the society. He argued further that the situation has also triggered frustration and state of hopelessness among the citizens as a result of the menace of artificial scarcity created by traders who allegedly indulge in unwholesome act of hoarding the limited available foodstuffs. The House, after an exhaustive debate on the motion, resolved among others that the state government should regulate prices of goods and services in the state. The legislature also urged the government to encourage massive food production by providing incentives for farmers in the state through farm inputs, such as tractors, fertilizers, pesticides, loans and other facilities. The House directed its Committee on Commerce, Industry, Women Affairs and Social Development, in collaboration with Hon. Commissioner for Enterprise, interface with the leadership of association of market women and men in the state to discuss the lingering crisis with a view to addressing the issues involved. It urged the state government to embrace community policing particularly, in the hinterland and border communities and encourage the security agencies to be more proactive in their duties of securing lives and property of citizens.
