Since taking over at Chelsea, Tuchel has deployed the American international on both sides of the attacking roles behind the striker in the front three and even as a hybrid winger/wing-back on the right side of the pitch. But the former Paris Saint-Germain boss has now made up his mind to play the attacker in the “half position in the front three,” a position, according to him, would be perfect for him(Pulisic) “I think the half positions in the front three could be a perfect fit for him,” Tuchel told NBC Sports about his plan for Pulisic. “I want him to make a lot of dribbles and improve his body positioning; where to open up, where to receive the ball and not lose his speed. “Because he can have these high-speed dribbling over and over again, and he can kill you with intensity. “So yeah, this is what we want from him, and he demands a lot of himself.” Pulisic has made 30 appearances for Chelsea in all competitions this season scoring 3 goals goals and providing 2 assists. The American is expected to make Thomas Tuchel’s starting line-up as the Blues face Crystal Palace on Saturday evening.
