The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has approved commercial flight operations for Bayelsa Airport. On Saturday, the Director-General, Nuhu Musa, presented the approval letter to Governor Douye Diri at the Government House, Yenagoa. The presentation followed the mandatory inspection of the airport and its facilities, NAN reports. Musa said the airport met all airspace standards and is one hundred per cent ready for daytime flight operations. The NCAA certified that out of 29 gaps, the airport had been able to close 26; other requirements are non-safety related. The DG said the agency had to limit flight operations to daytime, as the runway lights were still being installed. In his remarks, Diri commended former Governor Seriake Dickson for constructing the airport. “Having been briefed on certain requirements, I wasted no time in approving what was necessary to ensure that the airport was ready for use”, Diri said. The governor said all the necessary facilities and equipment were in place and assured that work on the runway lighting system would soon be completed.
