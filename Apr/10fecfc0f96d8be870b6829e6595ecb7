The Minister of Police Affairs, Muhammad Dingyadi, on Monday, condemned the attack on Zone 13 Headquarters of the Nigeria Police Force in Ukpo, Anambra State. The Press Secretary to the Minister, Mr Osaigbovo Ehisienmen, in a statement, commended the Police for repelling the attack, leading to the recovery of one general-purpose machine gun used by the hoodlums. He described the incident as an act of terrorism and pledged to ensure intelligence-led kinetic operations in the South-East. Dingyadi said the idea was to flush out illicit weapons and neutralise persons with penchants for terrorism and violent crime, threatening peace and stability in the region. He enjoined residents to deepen their partnership with the police by exposing enemies of peace and security to arrest the wave of criminality.
