The Nigerian troops have restricted movement along Damaturu-Damboa-Biu Road following a charge by Boko Haram/ISWAP members on the Kumuya military base in Yobe State. The terrorists hit the location when some Special Forces of the 27 Task Force Brigade, deployed at Buni Gari, went on a patrol. Assisted by local informants and sympathisers, they stormed Kumuya community, attacked villagers, the base and destroyed the military equipment. The terrorists used heavy weapons in the assault and patrolled the community to prevent the reinforcement of soldiers. PRNigeria reports that troops and those mobilized to the battleground eventually overpowered the insurgents after a heavy exchange. A section of the military base at Kumuya was burnt, while the number of casualties the military suffered is yet to be ascertained.
