Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo is injured and has been ruled out of their clash with Atalanta on Sunday. The Bianconeri will be without the Portuguese superstar due to a thigh injury. The former Real Madrid ace was unable to play a full part in training over recent days and will not be risked in a Serie A clash between two top-four chasing sides. Juventus manager, Andrea Pirlo is now planning on handing a starting berth to Argentine Paulo Dybala. Pirlo told reporters at a press conference ahead of the crunch league game with Atalanta, “Cristiano Ronaldo has a problem with his thigh flexors, he won’t be there against Atalanta. “We will try to recover him for Wednesday [against Parma]. “He wasn’t able to ‘push’ the way he wanted to in training this week and we prefer not to risk it. The internationals didn’t help, he’s been playing a lot lately. “Paulo Dybala will start tomorrow.”
