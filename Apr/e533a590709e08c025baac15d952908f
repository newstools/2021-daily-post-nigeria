An Islamic rights group, the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has lambasted a former assistant director of the Department of State Services, DSS, over his recent comments concerning the embattled Minister, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami. MURIC further urged the DSS to call Amachree to order, warning that the former DSS chief may expose the security agency’s modus operandi to criminals. Recall that Amachree had recently revealed that the DSS warned the President Muhammadu Buhari government before Pantami was appointed the Minister of Communications and Digital Planning. He went further to disclose some of the processes of screening prospective government appointees by the DSS And in a statement signed by its director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, MURIC said Amachree spoke too much and had given away the agency’s secrets. “We believe that Amachree spoke too much and revealed too much. He may not know it, but he has given future nominees tips on the need to cover their tracks,” MURIC said. “A trained security officer does not behave like this. He must be reserved. He must protect official secrets if indeed he has one. “But Amachree allowed his emotions to run wild. His religious sentiment must have beclouded his sense of discipline and made him forget the need for him to protect his former employer, the DSS. Amachree simply played to the gallery. “The danger here is that some of the unnecessary information about the modus operandi of the DSS can be used by smart Alecs to beat the system in future. “This constitutes a threat to national security. We believe that security officers should be cautious about the kind of information they release in and out of office. “Therefore, there is a need for the DSS to call Amachree to order otherwise others in his shoes may do worse in future,” the statement read in part.”
