Arsenal hero, Kanu Nwankwo, has opened up on Alex Iwobi’s exit from the Gunners. Arsenal sold Iwobi, who spent 15 years at Emirates, to Everton for around £30 million in 2019 during Unai Emery’s regime. But Kanu is now insisting that he was “surprised” Arsenal sold Iwobi to Everton, adding that Mikel Arteta’s side would be a “better team” if he was still at the North London club. “I was surprised they let Alex Iwobi go when they did,” Kanu told Ladbrokes ahead of Arsenal’s home Premier League clash with Everton on Friday. “He was supposed to be a part of this team, and I think they would be a better team with him in it. He’s Arsenal blood, and he’s always given his all for the team. “He plays at an international level. “I believe he’d be much more comfortable in this Arsenal team than he is in the Everton team.” Iwobi scored 15 goals in 149 matches for Arsenal. The 24-year-old has scored four goals in 62 games for Everton so far.
