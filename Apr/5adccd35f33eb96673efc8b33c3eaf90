Arsenal is unlikely to renew David Luiz’s contract this summer, according to Football London. Luiz has made 16 starts this season for the Gunners, but has been forced to have knee surgery this month. The Brazilian will miss Thursday’s Europa League quarter-final second leg at Slavia Prague and this weekend’s Premier League clash with Fulham. Mikel Arteta now relies on Pablo Mari, Gabriel Magalhaes and Rob Holding in centre back positions. With William Saliba and Dinos Mavropanos both returning from loans at Nice and Stuttgart respectively, Arteta feels he has enough options in that position. Arteta is particularly keen to give more opportunities to Saliba, who endured a tough start to his Arsenal career after failing to make a single first-team appearance at the beginning of this campaign. Saliba, 20, has played 16 times since leaving in January, winning the club’s player of the month award in his first four weeks with the Ligue 1 outfit.
