Leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has said that Nigerian Citizens have the power to sack any government. He described citizens as employers who can decide to fire their employees (government) when they are found wanting. In a tweet on his official Twitter page on Thursday, the IPOB leader said it is time to “payback”. Recall that the IPOB members have several times been accused of launching an attack on Nigerian security agencies in the South East. Former Inspector-General of Police, IGP, Muhammed Adamu, on Tuesday, ordered police officers to go after members of IPOB over the recent attack on Imo State Police Headquarters and the correctional centre in Owerri, the state capital. Gunmen had attacked the facilities on Monday, setting over 1,800 inmates free. In his tweet, Nnamdi Kanu alleged that the government had killed its citizens enough, hence, a need for revenge. The tweet reads: “No government can defeat her citizens. The citizens are their employers. You can never be stronger than your employer. He/She has the right to sack you. “#Nigeria Govt with British Neo-Colonialists have killed us enough. Time for citizens to pay them back in their coin. #UGM”.
