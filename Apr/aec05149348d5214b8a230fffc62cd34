Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde has said he will soon expose those politicising insecurity in the state. Admitting the state was facing insecurity challenges, Makinde insisted the situation was not peculiar to Oyo but a nationwide phenomenon. “If they are politicising the issue of security because they want to be in power in 2023, it means they are making a huge mistake”, Taiwo Adisa, his spokesman quoted him as saying. The governor stated that his administration had taken time to investigate and proffer solutions to reports of anxiety. Makinde implored those fuelling insecurity issues ahead of the general elections to desist and stop engaging in actions that cause palpable fear. “We are doing different things. As a matter of fact, it is on record that there is no government in this state that has spent more money on security than this current one.” Makinde pointed out that his administration donated vehicles and communication gadgets to security agencies, and re-established Swift Response Squad (SRS) as well as Operation Burst. “I must warn that politics is inherent in this insecurity issue and in the days to come, I will expose the people that are politicising it”, he said.
