Three men have been caught on camera having their bath on a bridge in Ibadan, Oyo State, in broad daylight. The video of the men suspected to either be ritualists or artists shooting a video has now gone viral. The men, in red wrappers tied around their waist, could be seen scrubbing their bodies with soap to the shock of road users and bystanders. Many Nigerians converged under the bridge to watch the shocking scene as the man filming the scene is heard saying the men bathing came with ‘army’ escorts. Some persons are wondering how bold the men must be to take such action in broad daylight whilst some others think it might just be a skit.
