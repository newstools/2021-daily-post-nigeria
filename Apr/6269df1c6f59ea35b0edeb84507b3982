Arsenal midfielder, Granit Xhaka, was furious with his team-mates, after they conceded a late equalizer to Slavia Prague in the Europa League on Thursday night. Alexandre Lacazette, Bukayo Saka and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang all missed good chances to score, before Nicolas Pepe netted in the 86th minute. However, with seconds left, the Gunners conceded a corner kick, from which Thomas Holes in the all-important away goal. It means that a 0-0 draw next week in Czech Republic, will be enough to dump Arsenal out of European competition. As the players sulked off the Emirates pitch, an angry Granit Xhaka was overheard screaming at his team-mates for playing themselves into trouble at the back. The Swiss midfielder yelled: “Just clear the f****** ball away man.” Speaking after the damaging draw, Arteta seemed to hint that he agreed with Xhaka, claiming his players kept the ball in areas they didn’t need to.
