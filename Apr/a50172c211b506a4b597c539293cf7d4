Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu has directed the immediate sealing of EASY ON PETROL STATION at Ngwa Road, Aba. This is sequel to the alleged incessant obstruction of construction work presently ongoing at Ngwa Road, coupled with harassment and physical assault of construction workers and staff of the State Ministry of Environment who are engaged on the project by owners and workers of the said petrol station. In a press release made available to DAILY POST on Thursday night, the Abia Governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Onyebuchi Ememanka, said the directive shall remain operative until the Ngwa Road project is completed and commissioned. According to Governor Ikpeazu, the ongoing reconstruction work on Ngwa Road and other adjoining roads under the NEWMAP projects and indeed, all projects in Abia State, done with taxpayers money are of fundamental importance to the government of Abia State and under no circumstances whatsoever will government stand and watch unscrupulous persons get in the way of such projects. He hereby directed the Executive Chairman of Aba South LGA, the Area Commander of the Nigeria Police, Aba and the relevant Divisional Police Officers, the Commander of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps in Aba and the General Manager of the Traffic and Indiscipline Management Agency of Abia State (TIMAAS) to immediately ensure the full implementation of this directive. The State Chief Executive also warned the operators of the petrol station that any further disturbances from them against those lawfully engaged in the reconstruction work will attract an immediate revocation of the Certificate of Occupancy for that property. “This shall be done without any further reference to the persons involved,” he added. Governor Ikpeazu reiterated his earlier warning to any person or group of persons, by whatever name called, who plans to disrupt the work at Ngwa Road or any other project site in the State, under any guise whatsoever, that the full weight of the State Government will be unleashed on them. He warned that the Government shall not tolerate any act of sabotage against the efforts put in place at rebuilding infrastructure.
