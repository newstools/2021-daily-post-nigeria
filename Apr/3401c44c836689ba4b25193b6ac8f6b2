In order for the security architecture in Osun State to be fortified during the forthcoming Easter celebrations, the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Osun State Command has assured residents that it has deployed personnel to all communities across the state. This was made known to DAILY POST on Thursday in a press release issued by the State Commandant, Abdulkadir Sulu and signed by the Command Public Relations Officer, Deputy Superintendent Adigun Daniel. According to the release, parents and guardians were advised to warn their children and wards to avoid actions and conduct that could breach the relative peace being enjoyed in the state. Adigun disclosed that State Command has deployed more than a thousand personnel across the state, to protect critical national assets and infrastructure and be on the look-out for those who might want to exploit the festive season to commit crimes. He appealed to every law-abiding individual to go about their legal activities without any fear, adding that the NSCDC is ready to deal decisively with any miscreants or groups who might want to disrupt the peace and create unnecessary tension in the state. Similarly, the State Commandant has appealed to the travelling public to be watchful of the type of vehicles they board and to ensure that the details of such vehicles are communicated to their relations. “Residents of the state are encouraged to report suspicious persons or activities they notice to the nearest offices of security agencies across the state. “Vandals of critical national assets and infrastructure should steer clear especially those involved in illegal connection to the national grid. While felicitating with the Christian community in the state, the NSCDC Commandant prayed that the lessons learnt from the season will be used to strengthen and consolidate National Unity for the progress of Nigeria.
