Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, would be without strikers Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette, for the visit of Everton in the Premier League on Friday. Aubameyang is recovering from malaria, while Lacazette pulled his hamstring last week during the 1-1 draw with Fulham. A club statement said: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang – Auba continues to recover after contracting malaria on international duty. Auba will be unavailable for Friday’s match against Everton but is hoping to resume light training by the end of this week. “Alex Lacazette – Left hamstring. Alex has sustained a strain to his left hamstring and will be unavailable for Friday’s match against Everton. He will continue to work with the medical team and will be assessed ahead of next week’s matches.” David Luiz is “making very good progress and is hoping to integrate back into light training with the squad next week” while Martin Odegaard is “back in light training and will be assessed ahead of the Everton match regarding his availability.” Kieran Tierney remains a long term absentee after damaging his knee ligaments.
