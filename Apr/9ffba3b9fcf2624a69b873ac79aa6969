The Zamfara State Governor Bello Matawalle on Friday visited the Gusau Central Market to assess the prices of foodstuffs and other essential commodities as part of his efforts to ensure a reduction in the cost of food items during the Ramadan fast. The governor who interacted with the traders in the market asked for the prices of various food items and other essential commodities. He advised grain sellers in the market to consider reducing the prices of the food items seeing the level of hardship experienced by the people especially the needy. The Governor said “as Muslims, there is a need to assist one another to make people carry out their obligatory fasting with ease. This can especially be achieved if the consumables are affordable and by doing this, the traders can earn Allah’s abundant rewards” During the price assessment visit, Matawalle also purchased ten bags of local rice for his household and urged people to patronize local products to boost the state’s economy and that of the nation at large. He assured that his administration will continue to support traders with all that required to improve their businesses.
