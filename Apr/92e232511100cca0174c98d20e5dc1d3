Popular Nigerian singer, Peruzzi has described rumors that he slept with Chioma, Davido’s fiancée as absurd. Amid Davido’s breakup with Chioma and an affair with Mya Yafai , there were reports online alleging that Peruzzi slept with Chioma. However, Peruzzi in an interview with media personality, Chude Jideonnwo, said it is crazy to cook up stories of him having sex with the wife of a man who changed his life. “Someone said I had sex with the wife of the man who helped me. Do you know how crazy that is? ” According to the 31-year-old singer, the rumors have made him more careful about what goes on around him. “Even if you hate me as a person, what did Davido do to you? Anyway, right now, I am careful of every pin that drops near me,” Peruzzi added.
