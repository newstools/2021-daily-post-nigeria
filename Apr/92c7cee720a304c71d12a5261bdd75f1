A former Liverpool player, Mark Lawrenson, has predicted Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final clash between Chelsea and Manchester City. Lawrenson believes Pep Guardiola’s men are favourite to win the FA Cup last-4 tie against Chelsea at Wembley Stadium because they will create a lot of goal scoring chances against the Blues. Chelsea head to the game after eliminating FC Porto from the Champions League in midweek, while Man City knocked Borussia Dortmund out from the competition. Providing his prediction, Lawrenson told BBC Sport: “Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel will treat this tie exactly the same as he would if they were meeting in Europe – first and foremost, he will make sure his side are not open, and then he will try to hit City on the break. “I can’t see Tuchel just going for it on Saturday – put it that way. It is not in his DNA. But I don’t think his game plan will work. City are going to have so much of the ball that they will create chances. “If Pep Guardiola’s side scores the first goal, then that could be curtains for Chelsea. I wouldn’t say the same applies if Chelsea score first, though. “City had to work hard to get past Everton in the sixth round, but they found a way through in the end. This will be a similar story. Chelsea 0, Man City 2.’’ The kick-off time for the FA Cup match is 5: 30pm.
