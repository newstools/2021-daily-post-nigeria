Founder of the breakaway European Super League and Juventus chairman, Andrea Agnelli, called time on the project on Wednesday after six English Premier League, EPL, clubs withdrew. Agnelli then blamed the involvement of politicians for the league’s downfall. Twelve of Europe’s leading football clubs from England, Spain and Italy announced a breakaway league last weekend. But after two days of intense criticism from fans and politicians, the six EPL clubs pulled out on Tuesday. Asked whether the project could still happen after the departures, Agnelli told Reuters: “To be frank and honest, no. Evidently, that is not the case.” “I remain convinced of the beauty of that project,” Agnelli added, stating it would have created the best competition in the world. “But admittedly, I mean, I don’t think that that project is now still up and running.” Agnelli disclosed that other clubs were ready to join the new European league before the English sides left. “I am not going to say how many clubs contacted me in just 24 hours asking if they could join,” he continued, declining to name them. “Maybe they lied, but I was contacted by a number of teams asking what they could do to join.” Agnelli also said he felt the British government’s intervention, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatening legislation to stop the breakaway, had pushed the EPL clubs to withdraw. “I’ve had speculation to that extent that if six teams would have broken away and would have threatened the EPL, politics would have seen that as an attack to Brexit and their political scheme,” he said.
