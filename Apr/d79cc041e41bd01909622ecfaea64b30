The Biafra Nations League, BNL, says the just sacked Inspector General of Police, IGP, Mohammed Adamu has exposed the intention of the Federal Government for Biafran agitators. BNL said the order by Adamu that police officers use maximum force against members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has exposed a plot by the Federal Government to carry out extra-judicial killings of Biafra agitators. Adamu had given the order following the attacks on Police headquarters and Correction facilities in Owerri, Imo State. But the Deputy National Leader of BNL, Ebuta Akor Takon, who did not welcome the order, condemned the activities of the gunmen, stressing that his group is currently investigating their motives. Takon in a statement sent to DAILY POST said, “since the IPOB has denied involvement, and no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks on uniformed men in the South East, Cross River and Akwa Ibom State it means that the federal government is sponsoring the attacks to label all Biafrans as terrorist”. The group warned that the federal government “must not play with the lives of the people of the old Eastern Nigeria.” BNL wondered why security operatives could not “make any arrest during the attack to ascertain which group is behind it. The group further warned the Federal government not to invite another trouble by arresting separatists.
