Thomas Tuchel has admitted that Tammy Abraham is “angry” with him and is feeling worried about his situation at Chelsea. Lack of game time for the Nigerian-born England International is sparking transfer talk around the 23-year-old. Abraham has not played for the club in 12 games since February 20, with untimely injuries and fierce competition for places conspiring against him. The German tactician told reporters about Abraham, “Everybody is concerned when they’re not in the squad but it’s never an easy decision for me to take. “I have a lot of sympathy for him and I can understand that he is worried and sad and maybe angry with me when I make these decisions. “Sometimes we spend almost an hour talking after the last training which decisions to take and which players we have to leave at home because it’s thin margins which decide. “Tammy has had this decision now a few times against him which is never personal but this is life at Chelsea sometimes as a player. “I hope that he does not get lost in too many thoughts because he knows not to be too concerned about his situation.”
