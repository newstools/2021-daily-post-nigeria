The Northern Governors’ Forum has condemned the recent killing of three students of the Greenfield University, Kaduna. The Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau, Simon Lalong, described the incident as an act of wickedness and barbaric, saying the perpetrators must not go unpunished. The governor condemned the act, in a statement by his Director of Press and Public Affairs, Dr Makut Macham, on Saturday in Jos. The three students were among those abducted few days ago by gunmen at the university campus. Lalong said there was no justification for the murder of the innocent students who were simply in school to study and prepare themselves for service to the nation. He said northern governors would continue to engage the Federal Government and security agencies, towards finding a lasting solution to kidnapping and other criminal activities especially in schools in the region. He expressed concern that the heinous act would have great implications for the future of education in the region and the nation at large. While commiserating with the families of the murdered students, Lalong called for the immediate and unconditional release of the other students and staff of the school still in captivity.
