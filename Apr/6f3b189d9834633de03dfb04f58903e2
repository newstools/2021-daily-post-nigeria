Leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has pleaded with Igbo youths to desist from being recruited into the newly established Southeast security outfit, Ebubeagu. Recall that the five Southeastern Governors recently launched a security outfit, Ebubeagu meant to support the existing security agencies in combatting crimes in the region. However, the IPOB leader who believes that the Eastern Security Network, ESN is enough to tackle security challenges in the area, urged the youths to ignore Ebubeagu. Kanu stated this on Thursday via a tweet on his verified Twitter handle. According to him, “Dear Biafran Youths: Never allow anybody, Governor or whoever, to recruit you to fight your fellow #Biafran in the name of EBUBEAGU. “The ongoing WAR in our land is not driven by Biafrans but by Fulanis. And ESN is on ground to stop them. If you desire to secure our land, join #ESN”.
