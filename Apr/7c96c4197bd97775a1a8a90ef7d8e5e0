The Nigerian government has explained its directive to states to put COVID-19 vaccination on hold once they used half of the doses allocated to them. Minister of State for Health, Olorunnimbe Mamora, addressed the media at Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 briefing on Tuesday. The official explained there was no confirmation yet on the timeframe for delivery of second batch of the AstraZeneca vaccine. He said it was important that those who already received their first jab complete their vaccination. “In a situation where we still cannot determine when the next batch of AstraZeneca vaccine will arrive, it is better for us to vaccinate people fully.” The minister reminded Nigerians that two doses of the vaccination must be taken, in line with global protocols. The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) clarified that AstraZeneca vaccine and Johnson & Johnson vaccine could not be taken by the same individual. The NPHCDA Chief Executive Officer, Faisal Shuaib, warned Nigerians that different jabs could cause serious negative effects. “You cannot take the AstraZeneca on your left and Johnson & Johnson on the right. Both have to be doses of AstraZeneca”, Shuaib said.
