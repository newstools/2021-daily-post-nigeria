Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State has congratulated Muslim faithful in the State and around the world as they commence the 1442 AH Ramadan fasting, following the sighting of the moon. In a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan in Osogbo, the State capital, on Monday, Oyetola who described the month of Ramadan as a period of spiritual upliftment and complete devotion to Allah, encouraged Muslims to take advantage of the Holy month to strengthen their commitment to the service of Allah and humanity. He, however, reminded the people that Coronavirus is still very much around and appealed to them to continue to observe safety protocols at places of worship and ensure they use their nose masks. Oyetola further said: “I congratulate Muslim faithful in Osun and around the globe for witnessing yet another blessed month of Ramadan. We thank Allah who has made this possible. “As we all know, Ramadan is a period of spiritual uplift and complete devotion to Almighty Allah. We must, therefore, take advantage of this Holy month to strengthen our commitment to the service of Allah and humanity. “We must also endeavour to increase our acts of kindness and generosity by showing love and extending hands of support to the poor and the needy, as it was the usual practice of Prophet Muhammad (SAW). “I pray to Allah to accept all our acts of worship in this blessed month and reward us all abundantly.”
The governor also urged Muslims and Nigerians, in general, to seize the opportunity of the Holy month to intensify prayers for the continued peace, progress and development of Osun in particular and Nigeria in general.
