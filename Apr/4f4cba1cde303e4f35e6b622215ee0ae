Manchester United legend, Wayne Rooney has described Tottenham’s decision to sack their manager, Jose Mourinho as “crazy”. Mourinho was sacked on Monday after a run of not-too-good results with the north London side. The Portuguese is departing the club in less than a week to their Carabao Cup final against Manchester City on Sunday. Spurs have won only one of their last six games and suffering a 2-1 defeat to north London rivals Arsenal. But Rooney, who worked with Mourinho at Manchester United, believes Tottenham manager should have delayed their decision. “I think it’s crazy doing it before a [Carabao] Cup final. It’s strange timing, anyway, before a cup final. “I’m sure they could have waited until after the cup final if that’s the direction they want to go in. “Jose’s a fantastic manager, one of the best managers the game has seen. I am sure he will bounce back and a lot of top clubs out there looking to bring him in.”
