Shehu Sani, a former national lawmaker, has reacted to the news of President Muhammadu Buhari’s Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Ibrahim Isa Pantami appearing on US watchlist. Reports emerged at the weekend that Pantami had been placed on watchlist over alleged ties with the leadership of terrorist group operating in the North East, Boko Haram. His accusers also claimed that the minister was a close confidant of the late Mohammed Yusuf, the late leader of the dreaded terrorist group that has done unimaginable destruction in the region. According to the report, Pantami had ties with Abu Quata­da al Falasimi and other Al-Qaeda leaders whom he revered and spoke highly of. The Minister had since dismissed the report, describing it as fake, adding that he has been involved in various debates that preached against insurgency which had, in turn, endangered his life. And adding his voice, Sani, who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial district at the 8th Assembly, backed the Minister, saying that “Pantami is not publicly known to be a Cleric who preaches violence or advocates for it in his Islamic activities.” According to the former lawmaker, “Actually, extremists and terrorists disdainfully view him as a moderate establishment Mullah. Those who tagged him otherwise need to objectively review and reconsider.”
