The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Kwara State Command, has announced the arrest of a suspected rapist, Muhammadu Mailemu. The Public Relations Officer, Babawale Afolabi, in a statement on Tuesday, said the report was received from its Outpost office in Banni, Asa Local Government Area. Usman Mojana complained on behalf of his daughter who was allegedly raped. The victim was on the farm, with her younger sister plucking locust beans, when the suspect ordered her down from the tree and held her. The sibling ran away. Mailemu removed her clothes and raped her. One Sheu Garba, who responded to her cries, rushed in to rescued. The suspect was apprended after Garba called the attention of others. Afolabi said the girl was taken to the Basic Health Centre, Banni, for examination. The victim and witness confirmed Mailemu’s action. The suspect confessed to have committed the act but pleaded that it was the work of the devil. The family of the victim said they do not want any case, but for the suspect to treat their daughter. “The girl was taken to hospital for treatment and the suspect’s family paid the hospital bill. ”The family of the victim refused to come back to our office, for fear that we might force them to take the case to court,” Afolabi said.
