Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes has named Chelsea and Manchester United as the only two European clubs desperate to sign Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund. According to him, speculations linking the player to Real Madrid and Barcelona are nothing but noises as they may not be willing to break the bank to sign the striker. Haaland is currently being linked with many top clubs in Europe as he is considered one of the best players in world football. The Norwegian has scored a staggering 49 goals in 51 appearances for Borussia Dortmund this season. And Scholes, a former England midfielder, believes Manchester United and Chelsea are better placed to secure the service of the 20-year-old Haaland. “I think it’s about which club can [afford to] pay for him now. I don’t think there’s too many out there that can,” Scholes told BT Sport. “You think of Real Madrid and Barcelona, and all those noises that you hear, but they probably couldn’t pay that money. “Man City don’t look like they want to pay that money. And Pep Guardiola hardly ever plays a number nine, anyway. “Even when he had Aguero and Jesus fit, he hardly played them, so is that the type of player Guardiola wants? I’m not sure it is. “Look, it’s a player Man United and Chelsea would be desperate for and they’re probably the two clubs who I think could afford to pay that this summer. “I do think they [Manchester United] are desperate for that number nine. Haaland is the obvious one, or Harry Kane, these types of players. “Will they come to Manchester United at this point? Can Manchester United get them here this summer? I think they probably can. “But the two of them will have the choice of any club in Europe.” Asked whether he can see Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side capable of spending £150m on Haaland or any other striker this summer, the former midfield maestro added, “I think they probably would, yeah. Look, it’s a player United are desperate for.”
