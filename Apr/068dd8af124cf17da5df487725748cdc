The Police Command in Ondo State has paraded a houseboy, Emmanuel Akpan, and his accomplice, Goodness Ekpe, for killing his madam, Mrs Febisola Caroline Adebayo, a food canteen operator. The Commissioner of Police in Ondo, Mr Bolaji Salami, disclosed this while parading the suspects along with twenty-five others before journalists in Akure on Thursday. Salami revealed that on March 29, 2021, at about 2300hrs at Ifokanbale Street in Ondo, Akpan, killed his madam, late Mrs Adedayo, in Ondo with a machete while she was sleeping. The CP said Akpan received information from one Goodness Ekpe, his town boy, who also worked at Ondo, that the late Mrs Adedayo had a lot of money and this was why he carried out the dishonorable act. Salami said, “Akpan carted away the sum of N3,500 two phones, some jewellery and a generator from the house before he absconded.” The CP, who said that Apkan and Ekpe were arrested at a village in Ogun, disclosed that investigation was ongoing and after the investigation the suspects would be charged to court accordingly. He said, “Last month, we paraded some criminals who were involved in various kinds of crimes, some of whom are cooling their heels in some correctional centres across the State today. “Within the period under review, my officers and men have maintained a high sense of professional competence and this has brought about arrests and parades of the suspects.”
