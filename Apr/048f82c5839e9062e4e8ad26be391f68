Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan has faulted insinuations that President Muhammadu Buhari has left London for Saudi Arabia. Omokri, who described such claims as propaganda from the Presidency, insisted that Buhari was still in London. In a tweet, the former presidential aide disclosed that Buhari’s movement in London was being monitored. “General @MBuhari has not left London for Saudi Arabia. It is propaganda from the Presidency to disinform #HarassBuhariOutofLondon. “We have contacts monitoring his residence and also at London Stansted Airport. He is still in London and if he thinks we are through, he is joking,” Omokri tweeted. Omokri had led some Nigerians resident in London to protest against Buhari’s medical trip to the United Kingdom, UK. Buhari had left Nigeria last week Tuesday for London where he is expected to carry out his routine medical checkup. However, Omokri during the protest had said Buhari was placed under house arrest as he could not leave the Abuja resident in London.
