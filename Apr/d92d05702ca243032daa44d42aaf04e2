Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has named two players that the club will not lose faith in.
The two Chelsea players are Timo Werner and Kai Havertz. Tuchel said this on Friday during his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash with Crystal Palace on Saturday. Both Werner and Havertz struggled again in Chelsea’s Champions League win over Porto on Wednesday. The Germans have scored just three goals between them since the start of 2021. “They did not have the easiest task upfront. They had a big impact defensively, and they worked hard for us, both Kai [Havertz] and Timo [Werner],” Tuchel said. “It was difficult for them to find spaces and create something, so we changed after 65 minutes, but we’ll not lose faith and trust. “We accept sometimes it is hard sometimes to have a big impact. Maybe Timo misses a bit of confidence in his finishing, but Kai, I feel, is very self-confident. “There are no bigger concerns. It was just in this game we tried to change the momentum.”
