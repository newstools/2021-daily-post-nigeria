Chelsea will not have Christian Pulisic available for their Champions League clash against FC Porto in midweek. The American winger was taken off at half time, during their 5-2 defeat to West Brom on Saturday. Pulisic started the season still recovering from a hamstring strain he picked up in last year’s FA Cup final defeat against Arsenal. He has struggled to maintain his fitness ever since his return in October. Pulisic was allowed to impress from the start against the Baggies and registered only his second Premier League goal of the season to put his side ahead. He was, however, replaced by Mason Mount at the start of the second half. According to NBCSN pundit, Robbie Earle, Tuchel confirmed Pulisic had complained of a hamstring niggle which would likely render him a doubt for next week’s Champions League quarter-final first-leg tie against Porto.
