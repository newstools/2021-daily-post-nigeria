The Rivers State Governor, Nyelsom Wike has backed his Edo State counterpart, Governor Godwin Obaseki on the alleged printing of N60 billion by the Federal Government. DAILY POST recalls that the Edo State Governor had recently accused the Federal Government of printing N60 billion to support allocation for States and Local Governments in March. The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had dismissed the claim, stating that the governor’s comment was untrue. However, Obaseki’s claim had generated controversies as some concerned Nigerians including the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has called for the Minister’s resignation. Similarly, Governor Wike in a tweet on his verified Twitter handle on Monday said Obaseki understands the All Progressives Congress Government, hence there was an element of truth in his claim. “Nigerians need to know the true state of our economy and the truth concerning the printing of N60bn by the Central Bank of Nigeria. “If you hear what the Central Bank Governor said, instead of answering the question Nigerians are asking, he said the governors do not want to pay back the bailout fund. “That is not an issue. Bailout is a loan, if you want to take it, go ahead, but answer whether or not you printed N60 billion”.
