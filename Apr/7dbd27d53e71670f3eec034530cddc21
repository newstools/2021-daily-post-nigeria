The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, said dangerous driving, not bad roads, was the cause of most accidents. He called for the review of the highway codes to ensure stiffer penalties for road traffic offenders. Amaechi spoke in Abuja on Thursday at the Easter mega rally organised by the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC). Amaechi assured that the ministry and the FRSC would work together to ensure that the laws were reviewed. He said when this is done, those who overload their vehicle, drive while drunk or drive recklessly, will be more careful. “Most accidents you see today are not caused by bad roads but the recklessness of the drivers on the roads. “I want to urge all drivers to be cautious of not just them but the passengers they carry. Safety is paramount.” Corps Marshal, FRSC, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, said the major problem the corps was facing was crashes at night, adding that 200 lives were lost in January 2021.
