Festus Keyamo, the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, has mourned the late Spokesman of Afenifere, Yinka Odumakin who died on Saturday morning. Keyamo in a tweet on Saturday said Yinka’s death was a personal loss to him. Recall that the human rights activist reportedly died from COVID-19 complications. Reacting, Keyamo said, ”Yinka’s death is a personal loss to me. Himself & the wife, Joe, have been my long-time friends & allies. I knew them separately before they met & got married. ”I just called the wife’s line & they’re still at the hospital. My deepest condolences to Josephine & the Odumakin family.”
