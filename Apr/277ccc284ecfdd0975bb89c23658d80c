Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has urged the Federal Government to evolve a policy that will encourage the enforcement of open grazing and ranching of cattle as one of the ways to ensure peace and unity in the country. Governor Ortom spoke on Thursday in a virtual presentation as a guest lecturer at the 2021 Press Week of the Nigerian Union of Journalists, FCT Council, on the topic: “Insecurity in Nigeria: Restoring Peace, Unity and Progress.” He called on the Federal Government to direct the Nigeria Police and other security agencies to enforce the prohibition of open grazing laws passed by various states of the federation as well as implement the National Livestock Transformation Plan, NLTP in line with recommendations of the National Economic Council. The Governor recommended the payment of compensation to families of those killed and their properties destroyed by militia herdsmen in various communities across the country as well as arrest and prosecute the leadership of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore and other Fulani Socio-cultural groups who have consistently admitted to killings. He called on the Federal Government to proscribe all militant Fulani groups as was done in the case of the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), stressing that other terrorist groups should also be proscribed. The Governor urged the Federal Government to support the resettlement and rehabilitation of Internally Displaced Persons as a result of herdsmen atrocities in all states of the country. He said all patriotic Nigerians must support security agencies with intelligence gathering about criminal activities, stressing that justice, fairness and equity for all should be encouraged.
