Minister of Water Resources, Engr. Suleiman H. Adamu has said he has no intention to contest any political office after he completes his service as a minister. There have been rumours that the minister has the ambition to contest for governorship in the 2023 general elections. DAILY POST findings revealed that about six contenders have indicated interest for the number one citizen of the state under the umbrella of the All Progressives Congress, APC. They include all the three senators, Sen. Ibrahim Hassan Hadejia representing Jigawa North East, Senator Danladi Sankara, representing Jigawa North West and Sen. Sabo Muhammad Nakudu representing Jigawa Central. Others are current Deputy Governor, Mal. Umar Namadi and Controller General of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Muhammad Babandede. The Minister, however, denied that he would be running for the exalted office, while speaking to newsmen shortly after the emir of Kazaure elevated his traditional title as senior District Head of Roni in Kazaure Emirate council. “Finally after the “sojourn” in the public service as Federal Minister in the next two years, I will then take full charge of the exalted traditional responsibilities as the District Head of Roni. “I don’t have any political ambition for now and my prayer always is for God almighty to make the right choice for us here and after,” he stated.
