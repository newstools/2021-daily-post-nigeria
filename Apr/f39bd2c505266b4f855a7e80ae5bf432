Tottenham forward Son Heung-min has sent a message to Jose Mourinho, saying he was sorry after the Portuguese was axed on Monday. Tottenham surprising sacked the former Chelsea boss less than a week before the Carabao Cup final. The club has had a run of poor results lately with recent defeats to West Ham and Manchester United, plus draws against Newcastle and Everton. Tottenham are only five points behind the fourth-placed West Ham United with six games still to go. Son enjoyed a good working relationship with Mourinho and is just one more goal away from his best haul in a Premier League campaign. Sharing a picture of the two enjoying a tender moment, Son wrote on Instagram: “I have no words to describe how I’m feeling. “It’s been a pleasure to work with you. I’m sorry things didn’t work out and truly grateful for the time we’ve had together. “Good luck and all the best for the future.”
