A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Olumide Aderinokun, has said that the economic policies of President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government was scaring investors away from Nigeria. Aderinokun said this Tuesday in a statement made available to DAILY POST in Abeokuta by his media aide, Taiye Taiwo. Aderinokun was reacting to reports that Twitter was planning to site its African headquarters in Ghana instead of Nigeria. According to him, Shoprite had earlier decided to pull its operations out of Nigeria, a situation he described as worrisome. The Ogun Central politician said he was concerned that the “business policies of the APC-led government are not favouring anyone” – be it the citizens or the foreign investors. He expressed displeasure at how what he termed “government’s incompetence” might lead to making thousands of people jobless in the country. With Twitter ignoring Nigeria for Ghana, Aderinokun noted that “tecworldvy Nigerian youths have missed working opportunities in one of the most popular social networking sites in the world. “They lack direction and at this point, I don’t think the government know what they are doing. If you see the policies drafted by the Federal Government, especially by the Central Bank of Nigeria, it scares investors,” Aderinokun was quoted as saying. The 49-year-old suggested that government should be up and doing in making life favourable to Nigerians with the resources at hand.
