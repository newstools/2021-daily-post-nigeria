Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has hailed his team-mate Bruno Fernandes, but jokingly questioned the Portugal international’s ability to defend. Fernandes has taken United to a different level, since he joined from Sporting CP in January 2020. Together with Pogba, Fernandes has propelled Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men to second place in the Premier League and the Europa League semi-finals. “I enjoy playing with Bruno (Fernandes). He is someone who understands the game and understands the movement that will give you a beautiful pass, he can finish too. “He’s all over the place, he can do everything really, except defending! “But really, it’s always a joy to play him, to understand him. He understands me well, he can take my position. “I can take his position as well. I think he suits the team, he is a very dominant influence in our team,” Pogba told MUTV.
