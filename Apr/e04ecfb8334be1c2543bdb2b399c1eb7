The presidency is vexed by the Easter Sunday comments of the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto, Bishop Matthew Kukah. The cleric had regretted that bandits, terrorists, kidnappers and other criminal elements have plunged Nigeria into a killing field. In his message titled ‘Nigeria: Before our glory departs’, Kukah said President Muhammadu has become helpless despite condemning insecurity before he assumed power. His views generated divergent reactions but did not go well with the federal government. Presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a statement Sunday night agreed that citizens have their individual ideologies and versions of truth. Garba said anyone who professes to be a man of God like Kukah, should not stand in the way of facts and fairness. “In saying that the Boko Haram terrorism is worse than it was in 2015, he did not speak like a man of God. “Kukah should go to Borno or Adamawa to ask the citizens there the difference between 2014 and 2021”, he noted. On the Hijab issue in Kwara State, Shehu insisted the courts have adjudicated on the matter. The official said Kukah is “playing partisan politics” by dragging Buhari into issues that date back to the Olusegun Obasanjo administration. Shehu said the Buhari administration created a whole Ministry, for the first time in the history, to take care of internally displaced persons. “Some of the comments are no more than a sample of the unrestrained rhetoric Fr. Kukah trades in, which he often does in the guise of a homily,” he stated. The presidency urged Nigerians to continue to support the efforts by the government to secure the country and move it forward.
