A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State has disclosed that the leader of the party in the state is Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. The chieftain, Sunday Akere who was a former Commissioner for Information and Strategy during the first term of Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola said this during an interview session with journalists on Tuesday in Osogbo. Akere while denying the rumour that there was a supremacy clash between former governor Rauf Aregbesola and his predecessor, Adegboyega Oyetola explained that when Aregbesola was governor, he was the leader of the party in the state. “Likewise, now that Adegboyega Oyetola is the Osun State Governor under the APC, it behoves that he is the leader of the party in the state.” The former commissioner also debunked insinuations that the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state had been factionalised. In his words, “There is no double APC in Osun. There is no split in Osun APC. Oyetola is the governor and we must all as loyal party members rally behind him and the party chairman in the state, Prince Gboyega Famodun.” He, however, noted that the party like all other human organisations had issues and misunderstandings which they were trying to manage. “We as a party have misgivings and internal wranglings we are managing”, he added.
