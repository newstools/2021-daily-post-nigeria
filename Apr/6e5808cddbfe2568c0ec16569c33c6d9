Wagner Ribeiro, a former agent to Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, has claimed that the club rejected a €300 million offer from Real Madrid for the player in 2019. Ribeiro claims PSG made it clear that even “a billion” would not be enough to get the Brazilian. The Ligue 1 giants broke the world transfer record in 2017, when they signed Neymar from Barcelona in a €222m deal. Ever since then, a return to Spain for Neymar has been mooted, with Real looking to turn speculation into a transfer Ribeiro told L’Equipe: “At that time, he was close to going to Real Madrid. “Madrid were willing to pay €300m for him. Florentino [Perez] told me, but Nasser [Al-Khelaifi] refused. ‘Not for a billion, he’s not going to go!’ He told me.”
