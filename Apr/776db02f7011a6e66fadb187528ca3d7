The founder of Spotify, Daniel Ek, has claimed he has secured funding for a potential takeover of Arsenal. Ek claims he will make a “compelling offer” for the current owner, Stan Kroenke. Speaking to CNBC, Ek insisted he was “very serious” about taking over at the club. The Swedish billionaire also made it clear he was not discouraged by a statement from current owners Kroenke Sports & Entertainment (KSE) on Tuesday, declaring they had no intention to sell. Ek is being supported by Arsenal legends Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Vieira in his bid to take over at Emirates Stadium. The 38-year-old said: “I’ve been an Arsenal fan since I was eight. Arsenal is my team. I love the history, I love the players and of course, I love the fans. “So as I look at that, I just see a tremendous opportunity to set a real vision for the club to bring it back to its glory. “I want to establish trust with the fans. I want to engage the fans again. “I’m very serious. I have secured the funds for it and I want to bring what I think is a very compelling offer to the owners and I hope they hear me out.”
