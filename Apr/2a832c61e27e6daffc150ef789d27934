Arsenal legend, Ian Wright has hailed defender, Luke Shaw as Manchester United’s best player during the Red Devils hard-fought win over Brighton at Old Trafford on Sunday. Former Man United star Danny Welbeck put Brighton in front in the 13th minute. But Marcus Rashford equalised for the home side with Bruno Fernandes providing the assist. With just 7 minutes remaining Mason Greenwood headed home the winner for the Red Devils and the result gave United an 11-point cushion in the battle for a top-four finish. Wright told Match of the Day, “It’s a great ball too from Luke Shaw who, for me, was easily the Man of the Match for Manchester United. So in the end, United’s quality came through.”
