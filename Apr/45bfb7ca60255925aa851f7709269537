Police in Ogun State said they have arrested four men who allegedly burgled a phone accessory shop in Ile Ife, Osun State. The suspects, who were said to have run and hibernated in Ogun State, were arrested on April 21. The suspects were identified by the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, as Nura Bashir, (20), Awalu Aliyu (38), Shuaibu Abdul Rasheed (25) and Abdullah Usman (23). Oyeyemi said the suspects were nabbed following a report by one Gbenga Siyanbola, who had reported at Mowe police station that, while he was coming from Osun State going to Lagos, his vehicle developed a mechanical fault somewhere in Mowe. While he was trying to rectify the fault, the four men had suddenly appeared from nowhere and robbed him of his Samsung phone, the police spokesperson said. “Upon the report, the DPO of Mowe division CSP Marvis Jayeola detailed his detectives to go after the hoodlums. The detectives traced one of the suspects to Ikire in Osun State where he was apprehended. “His arrest led the police to nab his other three accomplices. “Surprisingly, in the course of the investigation, some other phones and accessories which had earlier been stolen from the complainant’s factory were also recovered from the suspects,” it was said. Oyeyemi said preliminary investigation revealed that the suspects had earlier burgled the shop of the same complainant at Ile Ife and that the case was reported at A Division Moore Ile Ife. “Unfortunately for the hoodlums, their recent victim in Ogun State happened to be their earlier victim. Meanwhile, the State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun has directed that the four men be transferred to Osun State command for diligent prosecution.
