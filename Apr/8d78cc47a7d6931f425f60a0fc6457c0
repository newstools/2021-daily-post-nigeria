Former Manchester United star, Gary Neville has predicted that Liverpool will be knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid on Wednesday evening. Liverpool were beaten 3-1 in Spain by Real Madrid in the first leg of the quarter-final ties and now have a mountain to climb at Anfield in the return leg. Although Jurgen Klopp’s side won their weekend Premier League clash 2-1 against Aston Villa, Neville believes Liverpool’s injury-time victory against Villa suggests that they will be unable to pull off the rest they require to knock Zinedine Zidane’s side out of Europe. Neville said on Sky Sports, “They [Liverpool] were really poor in Madrid in midweek, and they’ve given themselves a lot to do and I’m not sure they have got it in them to do it because at Anfield they’ve not been great – even against Aston Villa, they’re scrambling to win late on. “With a crowd in, it’s a different story, but I think they’re going to go out of the Champions League. ‘I might be wrong, but it would seem now that they’ve got the top four to concentrate on. ‘If they get into the top four at the end of it, it would be a half-decent result for them.”
