Real Madrid star, Eden Hazard, has warned Chelsea that Zinedine Zidane’s side would go ‘looking for the win’ when both teams clash in the Champions League semi-final second leg tie at Stamford Bridge next. Hazard, a former Chelsea player, gave the warning following Real Madrid’s 1-1 with Chelsea in the first-leg on Tuesday night in Spain. Christian Pulisic’s fine strike put Chelsea ahead before Karim Benzema levelled for the LaLiga champions at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano. The result means Real Madrid must score in the return leg against Thomas Tuchel’s men to stand any chance of reaching the Champions League final this season. Speaking after the match, Hazard said at his pre-match press conference: “It could be better, and it could be worse! We will go there [Stamford Bridge] looking for the win. “I am just going step by step, of course, I want to play, I want to be on the pitch. “I played a bit more today than before, we have games before the end of the season, and I want to be ready. I am just happy to be playing again. “Now I am a Real Madrid player, so I just want to win.” Hazard added: “The manager decides what formation we play, we know how to play with three at the back, but we can also play with four.”
