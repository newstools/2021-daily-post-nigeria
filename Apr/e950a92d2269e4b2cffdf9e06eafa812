Biafra Nations League, BNL, a secessionist group in the eastern region of the country, has threatened to unleash mayhem on oil companies operating in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital over Governor Nyesom Wike’s ban on Igbo meeting in Oyigbo Local Government Area of the State. Governor Wike of Rivers State had placed a ban on a planned meeting of some Igbo residents in Oyigbo LGA. The Governor was said to have taken the decision over fears that such meetings could spark fresh unrest in the LGA. But the BNL warned Wike to stop threatening Southeastern Igbos merely because of activities of Nnamdi Kanu’s led Indigenous people of Biafra, IPOB. BNL issued the threat in a statement jointly signed by its Deputy National Leader and Head of Operations, BBS Media, Ebuta Akor Takon and the Chief of Staff, Linus Essien. The group said that the recent attacks in Imo State is nothing to compare to the ones carried out by militants who are not Igbo in Rivers State some years ago. BNL accused Wike of being sentimental against the Igbo despite being an Igbo man. “Treating the Igbo as terrorists could give rise to real terrorism in Rivers State,” the group’s statement said. “[We) call on Wike to reverse the ban on Igbo groups to freely hold their meetings,otherwise we’ll deploy our men from Bakassi Peninsula to terrorize oil companies in Port Harcourt coastal areas.
