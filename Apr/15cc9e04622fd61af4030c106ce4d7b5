Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has warned his strikers that the next two months are important for them to show that he doesn’t need to enter the transfer market in the summer. The Blues have been linked with Borussia Dortmund, Erling Haaland and other strikers in Europe. Timo Werner has scored only one goal in his last 20 Premier League appearances, while Tammy Abraham is struggling to get into the Tuchel’s starting XI. Kai Havertz, who is increasingly playing as a striker, has not scored since September. Although Mason Mount and Hakim Ziyech have chipped in with few a goals lately, Tuchel feels his forwards are falling short. “For the next eight weeks, we just have to think how we can improve the scoring and the scoring situation and nothing else. And then in the summer, we will think together with the club about what solutions are the best solutions for us. “Is it the best solution to stay with our squad? Is it the best solution to stay in the formation that we have? Can we improve? Can we improve on the training pitch individually and as a group? To create more big chances? These are the questions for June. “For now, in April, everybody knows that when you read the statistics, it’s obvious and the guys lack this last percentage of confidence when they don’t score,” Tuchel told reporters from Cobham Training Centre. Chelsea face Crystal Palace on Saturday, looking to still finish in the Premier League’s Champions League places.
