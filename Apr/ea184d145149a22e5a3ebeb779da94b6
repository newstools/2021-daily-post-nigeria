Manchester City midfielder, Kevin De Bruyne, has revealed Pep Guardiola’s half-time team talk as they played 0-0 with Leicester City after the first 45 minutes on Saturday. Guardiola told his players to dominate the game and be patient against Leicester at the King Power Stadium. Guardiola’s men defeated Leicester, thanks to second-half goals from Benjamin Mendy and Gabriel Jesus. Asked what Guardiola said at the break to inspire Man City’s second-half display, Bruyne told Sky Sports: “To do the same [dominate the game]. Obviously, we created chances, and we should have scored, but that happens. “We knew the way they play against us, it’s going to be really difficult, they play really defensive, so we have to be patient, and I think that’s what we did. “I’m very happy for Mendy to break the deadlock.” The victory against Leicester means Man City are on top of the Premier League table with 74 points from 31 games.
