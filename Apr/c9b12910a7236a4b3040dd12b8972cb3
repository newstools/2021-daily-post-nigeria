Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta is uncertain about Sergio Aguero’s future with the club. Arteta who did not directly respond to questions about Aguero’s future said the player has the talent to seek out opportunities. “we will see what happens with him in the future”, Arteta said when asked about Sergio Aguero. Aguero is set to leave Manchester City this summer when his contract expires. The 32-year-old is believed to be considering a move to Barcelona, where he could link up with compatriot Lionel Messi. But he has also been linked with Manchester United, Chelsea and PSG. Arsenal could also be a potential destination for Aguero, with Arteta, who coached the forward at City, adamant he is still an elite striker. When asked if he believes Aguero can still perform at a high level, Arteta said on Thursday: “For sure. Sergio has a unique quality to see spaces that nobody else can see and to score goals in a really easy way. “So I am sure that he will find the right next chapter for him.” Quizzed on if he will be picking up the phone to see if Aguero fancies a move to north London, Arteta laughed and replied: “No, no, Sergio, we will see what happens with him in the future.”
