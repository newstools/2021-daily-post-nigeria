Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has given has approved his striker, Sergio Aguero’s potential move to Chelsea this summer transfer window. Chelsea are in a prime position to sign Aguero, as the player is determined to continue his career in the Premier League. Aguero will leave The Etihad this summer when his contract with Man City expires. Chelsea tried to sign the Argentina international in 2011 when he was at Atlético Madrid. The Blues are one of the few clubs that could pay the salary of more than £13 million Aguero commanded at Man City. Speaking on the development on Friday during his pre-match press conference ahead of Man City’s Premier League clash with Leeds United on Saturday, Guardiola insisted that he would have no problem with Aguero joining a Premier League rival. “All of us wish the best for him,” Guardiola said. “We will be delighted with the decision he takes, the best for him and his family, to find the best for Sergio for the last years of his career. “My preference is his preference. His preference is my preference. The best for him is the best for us.” Guardiola added, “Sergio is a lovely person with specific qualities and skills. “I understand him, I know him, and I understand he needs time to get in the best condition.”
