Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud’s possible new club has been revealed. Giroud is expected to leave Chelsea this summer once his current deal expires at the end of the season. The France international has already told the Blues hierarchy that he won’t renew his deal. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, Giroud’s representatives have held talks with AS Roma over a possible transfer this summer. Roma are now reportedly ‘assessing’ the possibility of having the 34-year-old World Cup winner in their squad next season. Giroud joined Chelsea from Arsenal in 2018. Meanwhile, Chelsea have been linked with several strikers, Dortmund’s Erling Haaland, Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero and Inter Milan’s Romelu Lukaku as a possible replacement for Giroud.
