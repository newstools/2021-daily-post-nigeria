Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, will be without Mateo Kovacic and Andreas Christensen, for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City. However, midfielder N’Golo Kante is available for selection. “We have the green light for N’Golo because we had the three days in between, which makes a huge difference,” Tuchel said. “Mateo is unfortunately still out. “He’s feeling better but still out and cannot be in the squad, and Andreas Christensen is out, he cannot be in the squad, so this is the situation.” Kovacic missed the 1-0 defeat to FC Porto in the Champions League, because of a muscle injury he picked up in training.
