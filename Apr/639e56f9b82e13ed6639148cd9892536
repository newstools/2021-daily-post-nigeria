Real Madrid goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, has said that only one club can be in the Champions League final when Zinedine Zidane’s side take on his former club Chelsea in the semi-final tie later this month. Courtois left Chelsea back in 2018, which by his own admission, “was not in the best way”. The Belgium international will now get the chance to return to Stamford Bridge with Real Madrid after both teams qualified for the Champions League last-4. Real Madrid eliminated Liverpool from the Champions League on Wednesday, while Thomas Tuchel’s side knocked Porto out from the competition. “It will be very nice to see a lot of familiar faces [at Chelsea] and I wish there was public at Stamford Bridge because there was a lot of happy moments I had there, even though maybe my departure wasn’t in the best way, or it was put that way, that it wasn’t the best way, but I only have good memories,” Courtois told BeIN Sports. “Two Premier Leagues, a lot of other trophies, I’m really happy to play them, but only one can be in the final, and I hope it’s Real Madrid.”
