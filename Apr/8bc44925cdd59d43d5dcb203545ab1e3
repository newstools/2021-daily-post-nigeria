The Nigerian Air Force has dismissed claims by Boko Haram that it shot down the missing Alpha jet – NAF 475. The aircraft went off the radar on Wednesday during an operation around the Sambisa Forest in Borno State. NAF Director of Public Relations, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet said the footage in circulation could be from a previous incident. Gabkwet, in a statement on Friday, stressed that there was nothing to prove that the aircraft belonged to NAF. The spokesman noted that the lush vegetation in the video suggests it was not in the Northeast. “Until we get all these details straightened out, we are not going to go into speculation. “Unless they did something and they are releasing the clips bit by bit, we are waiting,” he said. Gabkwet added that the pilots have families and the military would only go to their family with “concrete evidence”. The video Boko Haram released showed an insurgent standing on the wreckage of an aircraft. It showed the Nigerian flag and number NAF 475 on its fuselage. A charred corpse in military uniform is seen. “This is the pilot of your aircraft, whom you sent to harm the servant of god,” the militant said. “This is what god did to him. He fell from the sky, and if you do not repent, this will be your reward.”
