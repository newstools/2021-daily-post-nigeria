Award-winning Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, has taken a swipe at Nigerian feminists. Chimamanda in a viral video interview warned Nigerian feminists to stop using feminism to justify their wickedness. According to her, some young Nigerian ladies in the name of feminism sound really mean and ‘nasty’ which is not the aim of feminism. Chimamanda said: “I say to young Nigerian feminists – please do not use feminism to justify your wickedness. “Sometimes, I see some of these young ladies and when talking to them, they sound really mean, and I say to them this isn’t feminism; you’re just being nasty.” Feminism in the world today aims to combat gender inequality and oppression of women in the society.
