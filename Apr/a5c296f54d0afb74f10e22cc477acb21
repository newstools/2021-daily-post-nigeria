Former Chelsea midfielder, Michael Essien, has named Thomas Tuchel as the ‘right’ manager for the Blues ahead of his predecessor, Frank Lampard. Essien disclosed this ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League quarter-final first-leg tie against FC Porto on Wednesday night in Sevilla. Tuchel replaced Lampard at Stamford Bridge after the Englishman was sacked by Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, last January. “I have to be proud of him [Frank Lampard] for what he did because I think he did a very good job [at Chelsea],” Essien told talkSPORT. “He brought several young players through, so I think he did a good job. He did very well. “But it’s the business of football. If the results aren’t coming, then the manager pays for it, but he should be very proud of himself. “Knowing Frank, knowing how strong he is mentally, I am sure he will bounce back very soon.” Essien added: “He [Thomas Tuchel] has come in and is doing a great job at the moment. I think he is the right man for the team. “We just have to support him and wish him very well. Hopefully, he can continue the good job he is doing at the moment with the football club and the players he has got.”
