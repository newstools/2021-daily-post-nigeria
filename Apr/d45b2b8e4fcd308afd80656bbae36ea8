Details of the interaction between Gerard Pique and referee Gil Manzano has emerged. Real Madrid defeated their fiercest rivals 2-1 in the El Clasico on Saturday and climbed top of the league table above Atletico Madrid on goal difference. Going into the game, both sides knew a win would see them go to the top of La Liga and the home side started the game composed. Zinedine Zidane’s side led 2-0 at half-time, courtesy of first-half strikes from Karim Benzema and Toni Kroos. Oscar Mingueza pulled one back for the visitors 15 minutes into the second half Gerard Pique was named on the bench and did not play a single minute in the game. But that did not stop him walking onto the pitch and having a go at referee Gil Manzano, fuming at the match official after the final whistle. Pique was mad at the referee for adding only four minutes extra-time. Marca reports that the veteran defender felt that more stoppage time should have been played. Pique also felt that his team should have been awarded a spot kick after Ferland Mendy appeared to pull down Martin Braithwaite in the dying minutes of the game. During the game, referee Manzano had spent around five minutes trying to fix his technology due to poor condition, meaning Pique did have reason to protest. Pique told the referee, “Let me speak, let me speak, you gave us a little extra time, and you’ve been off the field for a long time.” Real Madrid’s next game will be against English reigning champions, Liverpool in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final at Anfield. The reverse fixture ended 3-1 in favour of the La Liga giants.
