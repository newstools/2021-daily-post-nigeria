Arsenal has been uplifted with news that Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli should be fit to play against Slavia Prague in Thursdayâ€™s Europa League tie. The Gunners played out a disappointing 1-1 draw in the quarter-final first leg last week. During their 3-0 win at Sheffield United, Saka limped off the pitch and Martinelli was also withdrawn late on. However, the latest update is optimistic, with Martinelli declaring himself fit and Saka expected to be available. Arsenal doctors are confident Saka only suffered a dead leg at Bramall Lane, according to the Daily Mail. It was initially feared he had suffered a recurrence of the hamstring injury he sustained last month. Captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is also set to be available after missing the Sheffield game with flu.
