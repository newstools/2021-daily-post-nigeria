Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has snubbed Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich six times, with the Russian said to be “obsessed” about hiring him, The Athletic reports. Abramovich bought the Premier League club in 2003 and has invested millions into the Blues, to turn them into five-time Premier League champions, as well as Champions League winners. But in his pursuit for glory, the billionaire has sacked 14 managers including Jose Mourinho and Guus Hiddink twice. Thomas Tuchel is now in charge of Chelsea and has guided them to the semi-finals in the Champions League and the FA Cup. But Abramovich has always been obsessed with hiring Guardiola as manager. It has been claimed that he has followed Guardiola’s ever since he emerged at Barcelona, where he won 14 trophies in four years. Chelsea apparently made their first interest in Guardiola known back in 2010, when Carlo Ancelotti was struggling as manager, and they revisited their interest for a second time a few months later once the Italian was fired. A third approach is believed to have been made when Andre Villas-Boas’ tenure ended in early 2012. Guardiola announced his intention to take one year away from management at the end of the 2011/2012 season. But that didn’t stop Chelsea from making a fourth approach ahead of the new 2012/2013 campaign. A sixth and final attempt was made following Jose Mourinho’s sacking by Chelsea for a second time in December in 2015.
