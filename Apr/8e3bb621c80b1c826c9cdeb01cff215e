Uti Nwachukwu is of the opinion that acute cheating is not enough for a person to walk out of a relationship. The actor in a post via his Twitter account on Wednesday noted that it is extremely hard for humans to be sexually committed to one human for the rest of their lives. Uti who further revealed that the needless pressure of monogamy has/is still destroying relationships stressed that such relationships are pretentious, hypocritical, and sad. ”We are so obsessed with relationships yet we have refused to accept the inconvenient truths about them. If acute (not chronic) cheating is the reason you leave your relationship, then you have no business being in one in the first place not to talk of marrying. “As long as you have a partner that is kind to u, provides for u, spends adequate time with u/does not Neglect u emotionally&physically then you have all you need. “Truth is, it is extremely hard for humans to be sexually committed to ONE human for the rest of their lives. “I feel the needless pressure of monogamy has/is still destroying relationships. Most long term monogamous relationships are pretentious, hypocritical and sad. “This is a real non judgmental conversation everyone should have with themselves and their intending partners so u don’t lead anyone into depression via deceit. “Whether you are Female or Male, your preferences are your preferences and let’s not talk about Solomon’s Wives&Concubines because we know when we add religion, the conversation becomes closed&heated. Just do you and be real with your expectations,” he said.
