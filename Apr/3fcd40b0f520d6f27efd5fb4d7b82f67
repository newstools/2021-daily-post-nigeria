The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has told the Federal Government to stop playing the Ostrich regarding the state of the country’s economy. The governor disclosed this in a statement on his Twitter account on Thursday. Obaseki was reacting to Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who said his claim on the printing of N60 billion was wrong. Recall that Ahmed had told State House correspondents on Wednesday that the claim by Obaseki was incorrect. According to her, the money shared among the three tiers of government was not printed. However, reacting to the government’s claim, Obaseki said he wouldn’t join issues with Ahmed over the issue, urging the Federal Government to take urgent steps to end the current monetary ‘rascality’ so as to prevent the prevailing economic challenges in the country. “The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, @ZShamsuna should rally Nigerians to stem the obvious fiscal slide facing our country, ”Obaseki wrote. “Rather than play the Ostrich, we urge the government to take urgent steps to end the current monetary rascality so as to prevent the prevailing economic challenge from degenerating further. “We believe it is imperative to approach the Nigerian project with all sense of responsibility and commitment and not play to the gallery because ultimately time shall be the judge of us all.”
