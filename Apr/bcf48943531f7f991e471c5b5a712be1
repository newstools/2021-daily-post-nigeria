The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the late Olufon of Ifon-Orolu Kingdom, Oba Al-Maroof Adekunle Magbagbeola Olumoyero II as a true father who devoted his reign to building a modern Ifon-Orolu with a heart of service to his subjects irrespective of religious beliefs, ethnicity and gender. The PDP said the late monarch was a man who sacrificed and preached love to the generality of the inhabitants of his kingdom. The party made this known in a press release Thursday, signed by the state Chairman, Sunday Bisi and made available to DAILY POST. While condoling with members of his immediate family, the palace and kingdom, the Chairman noted that Oba Magbagbeola before his Denise was accommodating and never discriminated against anybody, a trait which translates into making Ifon-Orolu one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the state. He added that his reign brought peace and people of diverse cultural and religious leanings from all parts of the country resided comfortably in the town. â€œHe will be remembered as a progenitor of modern Ifon-Orolu, an ancient kingdom of undisputable historical heritage in Yoruba land. DAILY POST recalls that Oba Al-Maroof Adekunle Magbagbeola Olumoyero II joined his ancestors on Monday 19th, April 2021. The Olufon was installed in 2007 during the administration of Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola and reigned till 2021, a period of fourteen years.
