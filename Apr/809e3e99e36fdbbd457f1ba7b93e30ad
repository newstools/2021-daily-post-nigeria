The lawmaker representing Abia North senatorial district in the National Assembly, Senator Orji-Uzor Kalu, has suggested that politicians are sponsoring the various attacks in the South-East. Reacting to the latest attack on Governor Hope Uzodinma’s house, Kalu said the security agencies must up their game and go after those carrying out those attacks since members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, have been insisting they are not involved. Kalu condemned the recent attack on Uzodinma’s house and described the incident as barbaric, lamenting the increasing spate of insecurity in Nigeria. “The attack on Governor Uzodinma’s house is very barbaric… it is possible that politicians might be behind the incident. It’s very possible. “This is why…politicians who are using thugs during elections, after the elections what do they do with the thugs. These are things that should not be done in our society “I tried to speak to the governor this morning. I sent him a text to tell him that I stand by him because this is very barbaric. “Whoever did that is very barbaric and it is not an act the country should take likely.” DAILY POST reported that unknown gunmen attacked Uzodinma’s residence and at least two people were killed. Reacting to the attack on his home at the weekend, Governor Uzodinma had said that preliminary investigation indicated that the incident may have been politically motivated. The Governor urged security agencies to ensure that those behind the incident were arrested.
