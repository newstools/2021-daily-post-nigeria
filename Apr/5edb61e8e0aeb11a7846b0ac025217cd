The Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele has advised tertiary institutions in Nigeria to promote research to boost agriculture in Nigeria. Mr. Emefiele gave the challenge during a lecture on “Jump-Starting Agricultural Revolution: The CBN Experience” in Makurdi. He said the university community has a responsibility to foster research to enhance yields per hectare by farmers and reduce other constraints, such as access to markets and storage facilities for their produce. He said ‘‘The CBN is eager to see how the university community graduates can leverage their knowledge and research to come up with breakthrough solutions that would improve the productivity of Nigeria’s agricultural sector.” He also noted that the seed industry was a multi-billion dollar investment and offered the potential for collaboration between the CBN and the University Community. The governor also offered the Bank’s readiness to partner with Nigerian universities to achieve research objectives, while tasking them to set up demonstration farms from where farmers could obtain knowledge on the right farming practices to increase their yields.
