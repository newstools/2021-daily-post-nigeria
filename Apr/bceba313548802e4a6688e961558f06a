Nigerian troops have killed Boko Haram fighters in a gun duel in Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State. The terrorists were eliminated after an assault against soldiers of the 192 Battalion. The sect members moved in via a route on the Gwoza Madara mountain. Tango 9 troops responded with higher firepower and neutralised some of them; others were forced to retreat. An intelligence told PRNigeria that eleven corpses of insurgents were counted after the general area was searched. “With the aid of heavy firing and mortar bombs, troops engaged them at their mountainous den,” the source said. Nearly a dozen AK-47 rifles, anti-aircraft guns, motorcycles and other items were recovered after the battle.
