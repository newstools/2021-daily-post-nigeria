Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher, has described Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s performances for the Gunners this season as ‘lazy’. Carragher also urged Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, to get rid of three Arsenal players, Alexandre Lacazette, Nicolas Pepe and Willian. According to him, It will be a ‘painful’ process for Arsenal, but Lacazette, Pepe and Willian need to move on. The former defender stated this ahead of Arsenal’s Europa League tie against Slavia Praha on Thursday. Arteta’s side head to the game after losing 3-0 to Liverpool in the Premier League over the weekend. “It’s going to take a lot of pain for Arsenal,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “It’s the players, get rid of them. Stick with Arteta and get the young players in the team. “Odegaard has come in and been a revelation. He is someone you need to make a permanent signing if possible because he’s been fantastic. “Has Lacazette ever really been the answer? No. Willian has been a disaster of a signing. “Nicolas Pepe, it is not his age or his price tag, really, he is just not good enough and never will be good enough, so Arsenal needs to cut their losses there.” He added: “With Aubameyang, he’s the superstar, but I think his performances this season have been lazy, at times. “I don’t care how many goals he gets because if he does not score a goal, he doesn’t bring anything to the team, and that’s a big problem. “They need more from him. It was one of the worst performances I have seen this season from Aubameyang against West Ham. I think there will be a big worry at Arsenal that they might have another Mesut Ozil situation.”
