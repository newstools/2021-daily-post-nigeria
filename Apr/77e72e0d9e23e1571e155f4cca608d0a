The European Union (EU) has begun the implementation of its new €100million humanitarian initiative in support of the COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in Africa. Modestus Chukwulaka, EU Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS spokesman announced this in a statement. The EU Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, mentioned the initiative during her visit to the Africa Centre for Disease control and Prevention (Africa CDC) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on Tuesday. After his meeting with Head of the Africa CDC, Dr John Nkengasong, Lenarčič said he was about the new chapter in the EU’s partnership with the continent. Lenarčič noted that the additional EU funding against the coronavirus pandemic in Africa will help to ensure that no one is left behind. “I look forward to an even closer cooperation with the Africa CDC in the future, to strengthen our readiness and efficient preparedness to respond together to the challenges of tomorrow,’’ he said. President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, at the G7 meeting in February 2021, explained that the €100 million initiative was part of efforts to ensure equitable access to safe and effective vaccines to all.
