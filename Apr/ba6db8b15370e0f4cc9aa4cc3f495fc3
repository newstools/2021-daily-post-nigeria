UFC welterweight champion, Kamaru Usman, on Sunday morning knocked out Jorge Masvidal, to retain his title. The Nigerian dominated Masvidal last year over five rounds, but was not satisfied with his performance. However, in their rematch, Usman put his rival down with a devastating right hand and followed up on the ground. The knockout was recorded at 1 minute, 2 seconds of the second round in the main event of UFC 261 in Jacksonville, Florida. With the victory, Usman defended his 170-pound title. It was the first time the famously durable Masvidal had been finished by KO/TKO since 2008. The fight happened in front of a capacity crowd – the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Jacksonville, Florida — y’all said you wanted violence? You’re welcome. “With my fundamentals, I am the pound-for-pound best fighter on the planet right now,” ” Usman said in his post-fight interview.
