The Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has said about 10,000 Nigerians, including boys and girls are still in Boko Haram’s captivity. Ortom disclosed that the captives are being indoctrinated with militant fundamentalism by the terrorist group. The governor pointed out that over 30, 000 Nigerians have been killed and 3 million displaced by the terror group. He made the claim yesterday in Makurdi during a virtual presentation as guest lecturer at the 2021 Press Week/Lecture organized by the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Correspondents’ Chapel, FCT Council. Ortom said: “The terror franchise is responsible for killings, rape, public executions, bombings of public and private property, and places of worship, robbery and mass abductions. These include the abductions of the Chibok girls (2012); Damasak school children (2015) and the Dapchi girls (2018) including Leah Sharibu who is still in custody. “Reports indicate that Boko Haram is holding more than 10,000 boys and girls and continues to indoctrinate them into militant fundamentalism. “The group was responsible for the bombing of the UN building in Abuja and has killed more than 30,000 people and displaced more than three million people. The North East is still unstable and there does not seem to be any prospects of defeating Boko Haram soon.”
