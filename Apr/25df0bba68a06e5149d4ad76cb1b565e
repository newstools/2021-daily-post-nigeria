Arsenal hero, Paul Merson, has named Liverpool as favourites to finish in the top four positions on the Premier League table ahead of the likes of West Ham and Chelsea this season. Merson stated this ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League tie with West Ham United on Saturday evening. Liverpool are currently in 6th position on the Premier League table with a point behind 4th place Chelsea and 5th place West Ham after 33 games. “Liverpool are looking like a threat again, and I think they might just sneak into the top four now,” Merson told Sky Sports. “They have a nice run of fixtures, and the clubs above them are struggling. I think Liverpool are back in it.” Merson added, “I did the West Ham against Newcastle game for Sky, and it couldn’t have been any more disastrous for the Hammers. An own goal, a sending off, a goalkeeping calamity – everything went wrong. Now, I don’t see them beating Chelsea this weekend. But I don’t see Chelsea blowing them away either. “Chelsea don’t concede goals under Thomas Tuchel, but they don’t score many do they? They always give you a chance because they can’t kill you off, and Brighton almost made them pay the other night. I think Chelsea have a few more games like that in them yet this season – and it could open the door for Liverpool.”
