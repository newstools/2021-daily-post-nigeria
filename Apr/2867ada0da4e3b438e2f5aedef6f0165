Zubairu Usman-Ugwu, the Director of Administration, gave the advice in a statement on Sunday. The council enjoined all Muslims to be prayerful unto Allah to help Nigeria, the world and the leaders in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The Islamic leadership also called for fervent supplications for Nigeria to overcome security challenges. NSCIA directed the Muslim Ummah to practice social distancing when looking out for the crescent. “I’tikaf should still be put on hold while strict observance of all COVID-19 protocols, including avoiding lengthy or crowded sessions, should be observed”, the statement added
