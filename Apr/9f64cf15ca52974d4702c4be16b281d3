Uche Secondus, the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Thursday expressed fear that the 2023 general elections may not hold. Secondus said the 2023 general elections may not hold due the current spate of insecurity in Nigeria. He spoke at the party’s National Executive Committee, NEC, emergency meeting in Abuja. The PDP National Chairman lamented that the Federal Government has failed to resolve the country’s insecurity challenges. He said: “Our country today is grounded by insecurity and there has been no matching response from the government despite the demands of the 1999 operating constitution in section 14 subsection (2b) that “the welfare and security of the citizens shall be the primary purpose of government. “Terrorists in the North before were confined to the North East region but today 50 villages have been reportedly taken by them in the North Central state of Niger. “This has become necessary as nothing, not even 2023 is realistic if security issues are not adequately addressed.”
