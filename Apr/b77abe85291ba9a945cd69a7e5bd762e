Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde has declared that the maladministration of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will not extend beyond 2023. He noted that Nigerians were already tired of the party and would kick it out of power at the polls. Makinde spoke on Wednesday at the inauguration of the South-West PDP Zonal Executives, held at the Government House in Agodi, Ibadan. He said there was an urgent need to address the challenges of insecurity and economic recession. Makinde told the PDP to show the entire masses that it was prepared take power back at the centre. “I was reading in the newspaper where a national leader of the APC said that the APC will be in power beyond 2023. I want to say it is a big lie. “Nigerians are tired of the misgovernance of the APC at the national level. Is it insecurity? Is it economic meltdown? Is it the aloofness of the entire leadership of government? “Is that what is giving them the assurance of continuing beyond 2023? No, Nigerians will not take that”, he added. The governor charged the new executive members of PDP to bring aggrieved members back to the fold.
