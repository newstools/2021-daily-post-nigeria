Thousands of youths, women and leaders of Yoruba race are currently occupying some streets in Ibadan in demand for Oduduwa Republic. DAILY POST correspondent, who ismonitoring the procession, reports that the protesters are currently at the front of Mapo Hall in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The protesters are led by a Yoruba group, “Ilana Omo Oodua”, clamoring for self determination. The group is led by Professor Banji Akintoye, a former Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The protest, which was supposed to start around 9.am on Saturday, could not start until 11.am due to heavy security presence at the entrance and around Mapo Hall. The protesters having sensed heavy security presence later mobilized to the front of Mapo to begin the protest. Some of those who spoke, noted that Yoruba nation had suffered enough in Nigeria. One of the leaders of the group, Bashorun Kunle Adesokan maintained that it was time for Yoruba race to have their own country. He said, “Youuba have suffered enough. We are not in support of the 2023 elections. “We are telling all politicians not to contest. They should not contest to waste their money.” Publicity Secretary of the group, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye who spoke with DAILY POST confirmed that the security agencies did not allow the protest to hold at Mapo Hall as earlier scheduled. He said, “Dear Colleagues, the Police in Mapo, Ibadan said they are at the venue to prevent hoodlums from hijacking the rally for Yoruba Self-Determination, and not stopping it from holding.”
