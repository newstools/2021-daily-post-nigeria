Bayern Munich beat FC Rosengard 1-0 in the second leg of their women’s Champions League quarter-final on Thursday, to qualify with a 4-0 aggregate. Lea Schueller netted the only goal of the encounter for the German side. The result in Malmo extended the Frauen-Bundesliga leaders’ winning streak in all competitions to 26 matches. Schueller scored in the 22nd minute, heading in defender Carolin Simon’s cross from the left, following a slick passing move by the visitors. Bayern will now face Chelsea in the semi-final. Chelsea secured a 3-0 victory over VfL Wolfsburg yesterday, to progress with a 5-1 aggregate win. Lyon will take on Paris Saint-Germain in their rescheduled quarter-final second leg on April 18 after a string of COVID-19 cases within the Lyon squad. The winners will meet Barcelona in the semifinals.
