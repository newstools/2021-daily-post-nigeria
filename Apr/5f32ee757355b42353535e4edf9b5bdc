Lagos State authorities have found the female students of Oreyo Senior Grammar School, Igbogbo in Ikorodu, seen smoking shisha in a video. The five students were smoking in an apartment while dressed in school uniform. The footage went viral last weekend. The state government, through the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Youth and Social Development, has sent the girls to rehab. Special Adviser to the Governor on Education, Tokunbo Wahab, said the administration will go tough on such acts. The official reminded parents and guardians of their roles, adding that the government, school and teachers cannot play all parts. Several studies found that tobacco-based shisha and herbal shisha contain carbon monoxide and other toxic agents likely to increase the risk of cancers, heart and lung diseases.
