Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel has reacted to Timo Werner’s miss for Germany during the country’s shock 2-1 loss to North Macedonia in the World Cup qualification game on Wednesday. Tuchel blamed Manchester City’s Ilkay Gundogan for giving a bad pass to the Chelsea striker leading to the miss. The manager slammed critics of Chelsea’s Werner who produced a shocking miss during the defeat. Tuchel defended Werner and has hit out at the ‘annoying’ criticism of the goal-shy Germany international. Tuchel, however, is adamant that the versatile forward will soon return to the prolific form which persuaded Chelsea to part with £52 million to sign him last summer. Speaking ahead of this weekend Chelsea Premier League clash against West Brom, Tuchel said, “First of all, it was a bad pass from Ilkay Gundogan this is how I see it, no I’m just joking. “Of course he missed the chance and everybody is passionate to talk about it which is a bit annoying for me. “It’s a moment where he arrives where everyone talks about Timo Werner but the truth is he did not start three times for Germany, so maybe if he has more minutes he would’ve scored more. “‘It’s an easy solution at the moment to point fingers at Timo which I cannot understand fully and I will not accept. I am happy he is back here because here he is protected. The German gaffer advised Werner’s critics not to focus on the things he could not do perfectly or moments where he lacked confidence during matches but to judge him honestly. Tuchel maintained that Werner works very hard, creates chances and scores vital goals for the Blues. The manager advised the forward to accept this period as the most critical point in his career and accept.
