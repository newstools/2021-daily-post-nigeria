Alan Shearer and Ashley Cole have hailed Timo Werner’s performance, in Chelsea’s 1-0 win over Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-finals. Werner caused City problems with his runs in behind and laid on the match-winning assist for Hakim Ziyech in the second half. The German international has come under much criticism for his struggles in front of goal, but former Newcastle striker Shearer was hugely impressed by his efforts. “It was a brilliant run from Werner and Ziyech just has to put it in the back of the net,” Shearer told the BBC. “We said about Werner before the game, we highlighted some of the sitters he’s missed this season but that’s why he was in the team today. “That’s why he was asked to play on the last defender to run in behind because he knew City would struggle.” Cole, a former Chelsea defender, added: “This is why I love the way Werner plays. He isolates people, he drops a little bit deeper, that decoy run and then you get Ziyech running in behind in between the two centre-backs. “That caused Manchester City problems all day, to be honest.”
