The Federal Government has been urged to as a matter of urgency deplore more security operatives to Kente community, in Wukari Local Government Council of Taraba State. This, according to the leadership of Kente Development Association, would go a long way to sustain peace and protect the lives and properties of the people. The association, in a statement made available to DAILY POST in Jalingo on Tuesday, drew the attention of President Muhammadu Buhari, the state governor, Arc. Darius Dickson Ishaku and his Benue State counterpart, Samuel Ortom, as well as that of the traditional rulers of Wukari and Ukum council in Benue, to the renewed attacks on Kente community by suspected “Tiv militias.” The statement, which was jointly signed by both the association’s chairman, Fred Agbu and its secretary, Job Ayuba Hosea said the renewed attacks and hostilities on Kente “is to prevent our teeming population of farmers from farming activities.” They added that “We have confirmed that the Tiv people have vowed not to allow Jukun people in Kente, Rafin-Kada, Chonku, Tsokundi and Akwana Wards of Wukari Local Government Area to engage in farming activities during this raining and cropping season. “It is very sad and disheartening that the Tiv Militias have resorted again to the killing of the Jukun people despite the normalcy that has been restored.” Several farmers, it would be recalled, have been killed in Wukari council while preparing their lands for the forthcoming farming season.
