The federal government on Tuesday inaugurated 46 governing councils of Federal Polytechnics and Federal Colleges of Education (FCE). Education Minister, represented by the Permanent Secretary, Sony Echono, swore in the councils – 25 for Federal Polytechnics and 21 for FCE. NAN reports that Echono, who urged the members to bring their experiences to bear, stressed the importance of polytechnics and CEs in Nigeria. He said technical education was critical to the attainment of international minimum standards for human capital development. The official disclosed that the government recognised the need to enhance the nation’s manpower and redress the huge gap in skills acquisition. He listed the challenges facing the system as declining academic standards, examination malpractice, insufficient deployment of ICT and other innovative technologies. The PS also mentioned dwindling resources, overstretched infrastructure and unstable academic calendar. “The responsibility for the control and superintendence of the policies, finances and property of the nation’s polytechnics and colleges of education rests squarely on your shoulders,” he said. The appointees were told to exploit new revenue sources outside government to improve their operations while ensuring financial discipline.
