Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has expressed delight over the sharp drop in the rate of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV, which causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, AIDS, from 12.9 to 4.7 percent in Benue State. Ortom expressed his joy when the zonal Coordinator, North Central Zone of the National Agency for the Control of AIDS, NACA, Mr Lawrence Kwaghga paid him a courtesy call at the Benue Peoples House, Makurdi. The governor, after being informed of the development, pledged his administrationâ€™s support for the agency to achieve more of its objectives. Governor Ortom pledged improved funding for the agency in the state, even as he acknowledged the support of donor agencies and development partners to the fight against the spread of the deadly scourge. Earlier, while acknowledging the support of the Benue State government to the fight against the spread of the scourge, Mr Kwaghgba noted that the desire of NACA and the world in general was to end the spread of HIV-AIDS by 2030. He solicited revival of local offices of the agency for improved service delivery, pointing out that government support in terms of funding at this point was imperative. The coordinator stressed that there was need for increased budgetary allocation to the state and zonal offices of NACA to be able to achieve set goals.
