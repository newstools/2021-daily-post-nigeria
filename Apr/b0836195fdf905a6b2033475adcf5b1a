Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said he will not sleep before his team’s Champions League semi-final first leg against Paris Saint-Germain if he thinks too much about the threat posed by Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. Guardiola has admitted that PSG’s forwards are so good they will give opposing managers restless nights. “Always I believe the quality of these players, they have too much. “I tried to sleep well last night and that was when I was not thinking of them. Incredible top players, their quality. We are ready to try to stop them, defend as a team, play good football and try to score goals,” Guardiola told a news conference on Tuesday. While the tie is only City’s second Champions League semi-final, PSG is trying to reach the final for the second successive year, after losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich last season.
