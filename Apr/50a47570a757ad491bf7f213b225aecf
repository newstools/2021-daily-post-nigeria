The Police Command in Lagos has provided reasons for overcrowding in correctional centres. CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, the Public Relations Officer (PPRO) spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). Adejobi said apart from the police, seven other individuals and establishments under the Criminal Justice Administration were responsible for the congestion. “There are the suspects, the complainants, the police, the bar, the bench, the Directorate of Public Prosecution, the Ministry of Justice, and the Correctional Centres.” The spokesman told critics that the allegation of indiscriminate arrests was inaccurate. Adejobi said the police only performs its constitutional duties and hands over suspects to the court for prosecution. “This also extends to a case of two people fighting, except the complainant and the offender decide to settle amicably. “If the complainant wants to take the case further to court, the police have no-fault.” Adejobi added that the command had tightened security in and around centres located in Badagry, Ikoyi and Kirikiri to avoid jailbreak.
