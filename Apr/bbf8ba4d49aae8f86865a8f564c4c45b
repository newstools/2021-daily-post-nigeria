England legends, Gary Lineker, Rio Ferdinand and Glenn Hoddle have singled out Chelsea midfielder, Mason Mount for special praises following the Blues’ 2-0 away win over Porto in the Champions League quarter-finals first leg on Wednesday. The football legends cannot also believe the criticism being faced by the England star as the Chelsea midfielder once again proved his quality against Porto The former England U21 midfielder opened scoring for the Blues after an impeccable turn on the edge of the 18-yard box before firing a shot across Porto goalkeeper Marchesin. The England international has been a regular since Thomas Tuchel took over at Stamford Bridge but has often received criticism with his spot in the team for both club and country questioned by critics. Lineker hit back at Mount critics on BT Sport saying, “You still see it don’t you on social media. “Social media as we know is full of people who know everything about football “But the Mount misunderstanding is weird. He’s really good isn’t he? It was brilliant.” Ex-Chelsea manager, Hoddle, added, “He’s a top player, a top, top player and that turn was sensational. “But it was a great ball as you say, Jorginho, protected side, you’re being marked on one side and the pass actually beat him but the skill was excellent.” And Manchester United legend, Ferdinand also spoke about the player, describing his goal as “An exquisite finish. “They were patient, this was one of the main times they pinned back the Porto team. “This ball here, but the turn was just immaculate, the finish may be a bit of fortune from the goalkeeper just sticking his leg out. But a fantastic finish in the end.” Chelsea now has a huge advantage going into the second leg next week at the neutral venue in Sevilla, Spain.
