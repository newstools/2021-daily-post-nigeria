Liverpool boss, Jürgen Klopp, has tackled the national team coach, Gareth Southgate over his decision to leave defender, Trent Alexander-Arnold out of England’s latest squad. Klopp said he, “doesn’t understand,” why the Liverpool star was dropped from the recent World Cup qualifiers against San Marino, Albania and Poland. Southgate’s decision suggested that the 22-year-old had fallen short of standard this season. The coach had already been criticised by former internationals such as Steven Gerrard, Robbie Fowler, Peter Crouch and Ian Wright for his reluctance to find a place for the Liverpool star. Alexander-Arnold is the current PFA Young Player of the Year and one of the stand-out full-backs in world football over the past three seasons. He played significant roles in Liverpool’s Champions League and Premier League titles. Addressing the press ahead of Liverpool’s trip to Arsenal, Klopp was asked about Southgate’s decision and he said, “I didn’t understand it because Trent Alexander-Arnold was in the last two seasons at least, let me say the season before and the season before that, the stand-out right-back in world football. That is the truth and at an unbelievable young age. “So that [form] cannot be the reason that he was not in the squad. If you compare Lionel Messi every year with his best season ever, then he is not performing now like he was performing in 2005 and 2006 maybe. But he is still the world’s best player. “It is about how you want to play. That is the thing that Gareth has to make sure happens.”
