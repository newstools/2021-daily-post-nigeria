Soldiers, assisted by fighter helicopters from the Nigerian Airforce (NAF) battled suspected members of the Islamic State of West African Province, ISWAP, for nearly three hours in Geidam town of Geidam local government area of Yobe state in northeast Nigeria on Friday. Geidam is about 200km from Damaturu, the state capital and the hometown of the current Inspector General of Police. Residents said prior to the attack, the terrorists were seen in a convoy of over ten gun trucks coming in from the Damasak axis. “They gathered around Kafela Primary School on the other side of the town while our Nigerian Soldiers are camped on the other side of the town. Before the soldiers came, they had already started shooting and everybody was running,” Isa Ahmadu told DAILY POST in Damaturu. According to him, the soldiers demonstrated professionalism as they swiftly engaged the terrorists despite the way they took everybody by surprise. “Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighters and attack jets were swiftly deployed to repel the terrorists,” he added. Also, a source from the military said over a dozen insurgents were killed by the aggressive bombardments of the military aircraft. “The ground troops pursued some of the terrorists who fled after they had been overwhelmed by troops. We are yet to get the exact figure of the casualty suffered by the Boko Haram criminals as troops are still in pursuit of the fleeing terrorists,” he said.
