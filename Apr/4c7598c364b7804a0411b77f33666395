The Nigerian military suffered some losses in Sunday’s attack by ISWAP terrorists in Mainok community in Borno State. The number of casualties is still unknown after troops and the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) jets foiled attacks by Boko Haram terrorists. The insurgents reportedly rode on dozens of gun trucks and attempted to overrun a military base after invading Mainok. “They had attempted to take a military base through Dogon Karfe in Mainok but met stiff resistance from the dogged ground troops before the arrival of NAF Jets,” a military source told PRNigeria. He added that some terrorists are currently trapped inside Mainok town for fear of airstrikes. The source explained that NAF jets could not fire much missiles and hovered in the air for hours to avoid collateral damage. Some ISWAP fighters on sighting the military jets fled to Mainok primary school and burned a police station in anger. Those who escaped fled to their camp around the Lawan Mainari axis. The attack followed the fierce battle at Geidam, Kumuya and Buni Gari in Yobe. The NAF has deployed Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms in the sky.
