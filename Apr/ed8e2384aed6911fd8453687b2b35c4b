Liverpool hero, Graeme Souness, has criticized two Arsenal players, Granit Xhaka and Bernd Leno, following the Gunners’ Premier League 1-0 defeat against Everton on Friday night at Emirates. Souness said he was disappointed with both Leno and Xhaka for their roles in Everton’s winner, describing the goalkeeper’s mistake as ‘farcical’. Xhaka was beaten easily by Everton striker Richarlison before the Brazilian got to the byline and put a tame cross into the box, which Leno bizarrely diverted into his own net to give the visitors all three points against Mikel Arteta’s men. “Richarlison eases Xhaka off the ball too easily,” Souness told Sky Sports. “He makes his mind up, “I’m going to stand my ground and tackle and win the ball”, instead of forcing him down the line. “Richarlison, you know who you’re playing against, he’s not silky, he’s not tricky, he’s going to try and run you, try and muscle you. “He’s made a mistake, he’s trying to win the ball back. He should show him down the line, he’s too square on.” On Leno’s involvement, Souness added: “Yeah, it’s farcical. That really is a very, very poor goal to give away, an embarrassing goal to give away.”
