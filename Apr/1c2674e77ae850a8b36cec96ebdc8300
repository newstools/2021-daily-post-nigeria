Governors elected under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) have scheduled to meet on Friday (today) in Makurdi the Benue State Capital to discuss the state of the nation. DAILY POST reports that some of the governors, including the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, Enugu Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi and his Sokoto State counterpart, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal have been in the state since Thursday. The governors and other top government officials were in the state for the commissioning ceremony of the newly constructed Ultra-modern Tor Tiv Palce and other projects in Gboko Local Government of the State. The meeting would be the first physical parley to be held outside the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. A statement by the party’s Director General, Cyril Maduabum, said the meeting also aimed at reviewing the state of the party to strengthen it for future tasks. ”The physical meeting which is the first of its kind since the pandemic will x-ray the worsening state of the nation under the APC led administration. It will also review the state of the party, PDP and fine tune strategies on how to strengthen it to serve as a vanguard in the patriotic task of rescuing the nation from the rudderless APC administration that has plunged the country into the current avoidable crises of governance.” About 13 governors are expected to participate in the meeting.
