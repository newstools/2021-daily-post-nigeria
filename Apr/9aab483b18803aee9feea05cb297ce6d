An All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, Mr Edozie Madu has said it is easy for the party to win the November governorship election in Anambra State. Madu said this could be done by showcasing the achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari, both in the South East Zone and in Anambra State, which he said are numerous. The party chieftain who was the national chairman of Independent Democrats (ID), said this at the secretariat of the party in Awka when he visited the state executive committee to notify them of his intention. “All hands must be on deck to ensure that we win the forthcoming election. We can win the election if we concentrate on marketing what the president has done in the country. “We must shun divisive tendencies and go into the election as one. We have many projects by this government, which we can use to sell our party and ensure that we win Anambra,” he said. He warned members of the party in Anambra, who he said were attacking the minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige to desist from doing so, insisting that he remains the leader of the party in the state, and also sacrificed a lot for it. “I have been seeing what people are writing on the internet about our leader, Dr Chris Ngige, and it made me feel sad. Ngige remains the leader of our party in the state, and we must accord him the respect that is due to him. “All attacks against him must stop. The things he has done for this party, some of you would not be able to do. The places he will go to, to find solutions to the problem of this party, you cannot enter there. So, why are you attacking him?”
