Spokesman of the command, DSP Nnamdi Omoni gave the assurance in an interview with newsmen in Port Harcourt in reaction to the deadly attack at the Imo State Police Headquarters and Correctional Centre.

The Police in Rivers State is prepared to repel any such attack. We are able and equal to the task,” he said.
