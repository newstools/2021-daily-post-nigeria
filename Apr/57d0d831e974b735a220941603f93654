Nigerian Army says troops of 27 Task Force Brigade, Buni Yadi in Yobe State have apprehended a suspected Boko Haram informant. Brigadier General, Mohammed Yerima, Director, Army Public Relations in a statement issued to newsmen on Sunday indicated that the suspect is identified as Modu Ari. “Troops of Operation Lafiya Dole have arrested suspected Boko Haram informant whose spying activities and that of his accomplices were responsible for the attacks on troops position by terrorists in Kamuya, Yobe State. The informant who was identified as Modu Ari was apprehended by troops of 27 Task Force Bridge”, the statement noted. It further said that on interrogation, the apprehended suspect confessed to have revealed troops’ movements and position to his Boko Haram collaborators. According to the statement, “Investigation is, however, ongoing to unravel the network of local informants whose nefarious activities have endangered troops on clearance operations around the fringes of Timbuktu Triangle”. The Army in the statement explained that the unfortunate sabotage of troops’ movement by Ari and his accomplices made it possible for the terrorists to attack the rear element of troops on patrol. “Though the attack was swiftly repelled by troops from the Tactical Headquarters of 27 Task Force Brigade and Army Super Camp 3 Buratai, own troops suffered some casualties. “In spite of the setback, the Chief of Army Staff has encouraged troops of Operation Tura Takaibango to keep their fighting spirit up and to remain dedicated in the effort to flush out the remnants of the terrorists as quickly as possible,” he added. In the statement, the Army Chief charged the gallant troops not to relent even in the face of gross unpatriotic acts of some locals who are snitching on their movements and positions. The COAS also admonished citizens to as a matter of patriotic duty, avail the troops of credible and timely information that will help them flush out the adversaries.
