Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, made history on Saturday, as he extended his unbeaten run away from home to 10 matches, following a 1-0 win over West Ham. Tuchel only replaced Blues legend Frank Lampard in January. Since then, the 47-year-old has not lost a single game on the road. Chelsea took on the Hammers in a London Derby, looking to seal a spot in the top four. Timo Werner opened scoring just before half time, tucking away Ben Chilwell’s low cross. The Blues eased to victory in the dying stages of the game, as West Ham’s defender Fabian Balbuena was shown a straight red card for a tackle on Chilwell.
