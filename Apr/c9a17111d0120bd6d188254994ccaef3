The Federal Government on Friday inaugurated Amb. Yonov Agah as the Director-General, Nigeria Office for Trade Negotiations (NOTN). In March, President Muhammadu Buhari appointed him as the DG and Chief Trade Negotiator. Adeniyi Adebayo, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, charged Agah to make a positive impact. The minister told the appointee to work with critical stakeholders on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the second phase of negotiations. Adebayo urged the NOTN to monitor the developments regionally and globally to be abreast with current dynamics in trade negotiations. “International trade is very important in the expansion of the economy of a country because it allows for the development of markets, creates employment, thereby reducing the rate of poverty,’’ he said. The Federal Executive Council (FEC), in May 2017, approved NOTN as the standing negotiating body for Nigeria. Reports and recommendations from the agency on trade policy will be reviewed by the National Economic Management Team (NEMT).
