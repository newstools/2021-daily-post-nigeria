The Senior Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Paul Enenche on Friday dismissed reports of buying a private jet. DAILY POST gathered that some media platforms had claimed that Enenche recently purchased a private jet. They had shared a photograph of the medical doctor turned pastor boarding a private jet with number N838BB. But Enenche, in a reaction to the news described the rumours as false, stressing that the jet was chartered for his ministerial duty in 2019. Enenche clarified the allegation in a statement tagged: “On the purported acquisition of a private jet,” signed by his Secretary, Sylvester Edoh. The statement reads: “We became aware of certain fake news flying in the air regarding our purported acquisition of a private jet and we would like to make the following points clear “The possession of a private jet for easy, stress-less and aggressive spread of the gospel is not a luxury but a basic and vital necessity. “By God’s grace, we do not lack the capacity to acquire or own a private jet for the sake of the gospel. “However, the news of our acquisition of a private jet that is currently making rounds is absolutely false and totally untrue. “Having said the above, it is important to note the following for the records. ”The picture of the jet making the rounds is that of an aircraft, N838BB HAWKER 800XP (HS25), belonging to a private aviation company that was chartered in December 2019 for a series of crusades in Benue State. “We do not need to acquire or buy equipment before we can own it. “We have the capacity to announce by ourselves, whatever we deem news-worthy.”
