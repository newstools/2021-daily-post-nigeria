Well the truth is almost 18 years ago I was 20 and I got married to my best friend Michelle @yarnstaswitch and it was beautiful. I loved love and I loved marriage. Michelle is soooo beautiful inside and outside with such a soft heart. But then me being so young and full of dreams I went and fucked it up cos I was giving all my time to my Music. Music became priority instead of my family. He disclosed that he got divorced when he was 22-year-old and since then had stayed away from love and marriage because he was hurt. “We got divorced when I was 22 and it hurt. I am still very much in love with my music and I wouldn’t want to marry another and fuck it up again. So I’m taking my time. Why am I just saying this now?? I really like to keep my relationships private actually. Past or present. “But I was watching the bounce interview with Ebuka which is almost like a tell-all interview, and I felt bad skipping this huge part of my life. So yeah make una no vex o,” his post added.
