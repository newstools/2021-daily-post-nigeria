Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel has revealed that he told German striker Timo Werner, that as he cannot force a woman to go out on a dinner with him, so he should not force himself to start scoring goals. He said the goals will come at the right time, urging the player to take things easy with himself. Tuchel spoke to Werner following his shocking miss against North Macedonia in a World Cup qualifier on Wednesday. Werner missed a sitter and was highly criticised by both Chelsea and Germany supporters and even his national team coach Joachim Low. Germany suffered a shocking 2-1 loss in the hands of the lowly rated North Macedonia side But speaking ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash against West Brom on Saturday, Tuchel said he has spoken to the player about the situation. Tuchel also revealed that he cut short Werner’s training session on Thursday after the player had asked to work on his finishing. “It’s much easier said than done for me it’s not the moment to think about it and not to read about it and not to even train extra,’ Tuchel added. “Yesterday I sent him in from training because he wanted to do some finishing with us and I just sent him in. “I said ‘you don’t need that, your body and your brain knows how to score you did it since you were six years old so don’t worry it will come. “‘If a woman does not want to go out for dinner with you you cannot force her. you can just step a little bit back then maybe she will call you up.’ “The goals will come but of course he needs to do something for it and the best thing to do is not to think and work hard against the ball, be reliable with the ball, do your runs and don’t hesitate and be fearless and don’t overthink it.”
