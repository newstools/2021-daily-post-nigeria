Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State has ordered all native doctors and traditional medicine dealers in the state to register with the state government and the police. Umahi directed them to register with the state government within seven days. He gave the order after the weekly state security council meeting in Abakaliki, the state capital on Wednesday, NAN reports. The governor warned that those who flout his directive would be arrested and made to face the wrath of the law. “There would be an executive order to this effect and anyone caught doing otherwise would be arrested and prosecuted,” he said. Umahi also ordered that all wake-keeps and other social activities in the state must end by 6 p.m. He directed council chairmen and security agents to enforce the order. The governor put one million Naira as fine for offenders of the directive. “Anyone who defies this directive would pay a fine of N1 million as criminal activities are perpetrated through these wake-keeps which last through the night,” he said.
