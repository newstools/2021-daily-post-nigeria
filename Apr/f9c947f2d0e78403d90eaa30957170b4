Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has appealed to Muslims across the country to use the period of Ramadan fast to pray for the country to overcome the current security challenges. Makinde gave this charge while congratulating Muslims as they commence Ramadan fast. He urged Muslim faithful to pray relentlessly for the peace and development of the country during the fasting period. Makinde in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, admonished Muslims across the world to embrace piety as demanded of them during the Ramadan fast. He also urged them to beseech Almighty Allah (SWT) to put an end to insurgency and insecurity ravaging the whole country in recent years. “Muslims should use this fasting period to pray fervently for the security of this country. “I enjoin our brothers and sisters in Islam to please use the opportunity of this month of blessings to seek Almighty Allah’s (SWT) mercies to make insecurity a thing of the past in our country. “As our Muslim brothers and sisters are expected to adhere strictly to abstinence from food and other things during the month of Ramadan, I wish to enjoin them to extend their hands of fellowship to other fellow Muslims and non-Muslims alike. “It is only by doing this, coupled with sharing whatever they have with others, particularly the underprivileged in the society, that their supplications can be answered and the world will be a good place to live in for all and sundry.”
