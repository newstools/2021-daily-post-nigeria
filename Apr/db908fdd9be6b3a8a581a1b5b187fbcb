The Council of Imams and Ulama, Kaduna State chapter, has made compassionate appeal to the Management of Kaduna State University, KASU, to rescind its intention of possible increment of tuition fee. The group observed that increment of tuition fee at this critical time when the people of the state are being faced with various degrees of economic hardship would be detrimental of educating those who are struggling make ends meet. Its chairman, Shaykh Ibrahim Nakaka, in a statement, noted that the council finds it difficult to comprehend any logic behind the intended increment in the present circumstances, stating that many parents in the state are yet to recover from the devastating effect of lockdown experienced due to COVID-19 pandemic. The council also noted that the effect of Kaduna Urban Renewal Project and the recent staff rationalization in the state laid off many workers and as a result, becomes a problem to be able pay any hike in tuition fees. It cautioned both the university management and Kaduna State Government to be careful in taking any decision that would endanger the future of the teeming youths in the state. The council is of the opinion that any increment of school fees at this crucial time would only lead to mass school dropout of students. The council further observed that it would consequently aid criminality and disorderliness in the state, particularly now that the state is been faced with series of insecurity challenges.
