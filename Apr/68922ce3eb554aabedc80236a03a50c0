Afikpo South local government council chairman in Ebonyi State, Barr. Eni Uduma Chima has tasked stakeholders and leaders of various youth organizations to refrain from sabotaging and rejecting the formation of Ebubeagu security outfit in the south-east geopolitical zone. Eni who was a two-time member of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly made this known while interacting with newsmen shortly after an enlarged security meeting in the state. He regretted the rising insecurity in the nation, especially in the southeast, noting the razing of police stations, killing of police officers and innocent citizens by unknown gunmen, invasion of Ebonyi communities by herders and numerous other attacks on citizens. He, however, emphasized the benefits of the Ebubeagu security outfit and cautioned against the sabotage and rejection of the outfit by groups and leaders in the zone. Eni noted further that rejecting ‘Ebubeagu’ in the southeast, will pave way for Igbos to turn against themselves. “In other geopolitical zone, people respect constituted authorities and their elders. But in the southeast is unfortunate, we don’t have regard for authorities. “We on daily basis lay credence to the fact that Igbo are respecters of no authorities, ‘Igbo Ama Eze’ otherwise there is nothing difficult in the formation of a security outfit by whatever name so-called, in the instance of ‘Ebubeagu’ by the authorities representing the government and the people of south-east Nigeria. “It is left for us to make effective use of the platform. Ebubeagu will become what the people want it to become. If they want, they can give their support so that it will provide that necessity (security) that is lacking.
