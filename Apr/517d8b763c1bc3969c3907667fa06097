Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has predicted that Real Madrid and Chelsea will play a 1-1 draw when both teams clash in tonight’s Champions League semi-final first-leg in Spain. Real Madrid head to the game following a 0-0 draw with Real Betis in the LaLiga over the weekend, while Chelsea defeated West Ham 1-0 in the Premier League. Providing his prediction, Owen said, “Real Madrid welcome Chelsea to the Spanish capital, having not lost a competitive match since February. However, Los Blancos have won only once in their last four matches and come into this after drawing 0-0 at home to Real Betis at the weekend. “With no goals conceded in three games, Chelsea’s excellent defensive record continues to impress. Furthermore, the Blues’ have let in just one goal in their last seven away from home. “I don’t think Thomas Tuchel will deviate much from what we’ve seen from his side recently. That could mean we are in for a typically cagey first leg, so it would be no surprise to me if it ended all square. Real Madrid 1, Chelsea 1.” The kick-off time for Real Madrid vs Chelsea is 8 pm.
