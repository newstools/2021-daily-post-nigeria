Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel has reacted to the rumour that the west London side is targeting Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland and departing Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero. Chelsea is in the market in search of a new point man with Haaland top on their list, though they face competition from Barcelona, Manchester United, Manchester City, Real Madrid, Liverpool and other top European clubs. Haaland’s father and agent Mino Raiola were spotted in Barcelona on Thursday to discuss a potential deal for the 20-year-old and later flew to Madrid to meet with Real Madrid. The entourage will fly to England to meet with Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and City. However, Tuchel refused to confirm if the Blues have a date with Raiola already lined up. Speaking to the press ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League meeting with West Brom on Saturday, Tuchel refused to answer in respect for the player. When asked if Haaland’s transfer tour might reach Stamford Bridge next, he said “I will not answer that out of respect for the player and Borussia Dortmund. “But still everybody needs to accept, and I will fully accept, that this a player for Borussia Dortmund, a promising player of course. “But no comments in respect to the [transfer] situation, he is not in our squad and not in our club. So we will not comment on anything else regarding Haaland.’ Sergio Aguero will leave Manchester City at the end of the season when his contract expires and he is seen as a potential option for Chelsea should they fail to lure Haaland to west London but again Tuchel refused to be drawn on the speculation. ‘You can ask but it’s the same answer as Haaland. ‘We have full respect for Manchester City and Sergio Aguero, who is a big player for them. There is no words needed for me about the achievements of this guy, he is a world-class player.
