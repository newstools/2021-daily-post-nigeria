The Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Healthcare Services, Rep. Tanko Sununu, says a large number of resident doctors working in federal institutions are receiving multiple salaries. Sununu said this while briefing newsmen on Thursday in Abuja over the ongoing strike by the Nigeria Association of Resident Doctors (NARD). “Let me cite an example, in the list of names submitted to the Budget Office, there were many names of doctors appearing in multiple hospitals. “An account is receiving salary payment more than once in a month, which I was called by the Budget Office that if I can sign an undertaking, then their salaries will be paid,” he said. Sununu, however, said that he insisted on a no answer, adding that the right thing must be done and the list was sorted out to correct the anomaly. According to him, those that had received multiple salaries and the hospitals involved were sorted and forwarded to the committee. He said that the committee would table it before the house for necessary action, adding that the right thing must be done to end the current NARD strike. Sununu called on the striking doctors to tamper justice with mercy, stressing that Nigerians believed that their demands were genuine, but there were processes to achieve such demands. “On behalf of the speaker, the National Assembly, we stand to ensure that everybody is respected accordingly, but we have to also follow due process,” he said. He said the allegation that the Minister of Labour and Productivity was not willing to meet the striking doctors was due to a communication gap. “I believe that NARD not meeting the minister is due to communication gap, even while we were seated, the minister called me to update me on development, this may not be the exact demand of NARD, but the minister is doing a lot,” he said.
