Adesua, a Nollywood actress and wife to Banky Wellington also known as Banky W, has revealed that she had a miscarriage with twins months ago. Adesua revealed this in a video posted on Banky W’s Youtube page. Discussing about the trying time, Adesua disclosed that it was an emotional time for her and her husband especially when they had to evacuate the twins which were dead embryos. She said: “I had a miscarriage with twins, we saw the heartbeat and everything was okay but during a routine checkup, the scan showed no heartbeat for the twins any more. “I started laughing after the doctor told me and I went home. I collapsed on the floor and wailed. I had a deep groaning in my chest “I’m sharing this because not so many women go through this and talk about it because its feels like a shame. Nobody wants to talk about reproductive organs because it is like a dirty topic, but I think it’s important we talk about it. “I and my husband prayed about this, and it was an emotional time for us. He cried when we realised we have to evacuate the dead embryos.” Recall that the couple announced the birth of their first child in February 2021.
