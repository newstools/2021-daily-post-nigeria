The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra says the party is working hard to win the governorship election in November. Ekene Enefe, a chieftain, spoke on Friday at a grassroots mobilisation campaign in Ogbunike Ward 1 and Ward 2 in Oyi Local Government Area. He hailed APC members for their turnout in the ongoing membership registration/validation exercise. Enefe, according to NAN, described their zeal as a confirmation that they desire change. The local party stalwart said Oyi and Ogbunike communities were disappointed with the APGA government. He advised the national and state leadership to ensure that the winner of the primaries is the wish of the people. Benjamin Ezeako, an official in Oyi LGA expressed confidence about the chances of the APC. “We have been supporting the party in government in Anambra but we are ashamed with what we have as dividends of democracy. “We don’t want APGA anymore even though the first lady is our sister. We are calling on Anambra people to support APC for better governance”, he said.
