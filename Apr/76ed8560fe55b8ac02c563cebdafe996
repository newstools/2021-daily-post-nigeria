Former Manchester United midfielder, Owen Hargreaves has warned Timo Werner that he would be dumped by Chelsea if he keeps missing glorious goal opportunities during important matches. Hargreaves warned that the Blues will go out and sign a top striker in the summer transfer window if the German fails to work on his confidence level. Werner’s strike against West Ham on Saturday was his second Premier League goal since November. And the goal took his tally of top-flight goals to just six in 31 appearances for Chelsea this season. Werner missed a gilt-edged opportunity to grab a second against West Ham when he scuffed a shot wide from yards out. And Hargreaves, a former Bayern Munich star, feels the final stages of the season will be vital for Werner. “He can play in multiple positions, he has some really good moments and then he has some moments where you think the quality looks like it isn’t there,” Hargreaves told Premier League Productions. “He looks like he’s short on confidence, that you can see and the numbers suggest that, 31 appearances, only six goals. In Germany, it was one a game at least. “His confidence looks low and then he’s making decisions you wouldn’t see from him normally. “It’s a really important five games left for him to finish the season because if he keeps missing some of these chances, Chelsea are going to go get another big hitter. “Tammy Abraham is their top scorer in all competitions this season, there’s four others on six goals in the Premier League but Tammy’s their top and he barely plays right now. “If Chelsea are going to take it to the next level, they’re going to need somebody that gets big numbers.”
