Rio Ferdinand has revealed that Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has already placed Dean Henderson as the club’s first choice goalkeeper after David de Gea was snubbed for the match against Brighton on Sunday. The former England defender is of the opinion that De Gea could leave Old Trafford following Solskjaer’s decision to star Henderson last night. Ferdinand believes it may be the beginning of the end for De Gea at Manchester United. Ferdinand believes that De Gea, who has played over 400 matches for United, since joining the club in 2011, will not settle for a second choice goalkeeper. According to him, the Spain International could leave Old Trafford this summer. “You’ve got two options: you fight for your position or you say, ‘that’s me done, I’m off and I’ll go somewhere else,'” Ferdinand told BT Sport. Ferdinand, a former United captain, said that De Gea will leave if Henderson finishes the season as number one. “No chance, I don’t see it. I think he’ll go out now. His wages will be a determining factor but at the end of the day, two number ones doesn’t work. “He’s put Henderson in front of him in the queue. Does De Gea accept that and stay? I don’t think so. Solskjaer has seen something in [Henderson] “When David gets home tonight, his pride and ego will be hurting, and if it’s not, he shouldn’t be here.”
