Rite Foods, makers of Fearless Energy drinks was the key sponsor of the 14th Headies that held on the 21st of February 2021 at the prestigious Eko Hotels in Lagos, Nigeria. Fun, captivating, and eye catching are few of the suitable words to describe the evening.

This year’s award night is especially one to remember as it was curated in a way that viewers had never seen before; It had a hybrid of virtual and live guests, a dynamic made possible by the covid-19 protocols imposed by Government due to the pandemic. We also got a lot of eyes tuning in as the show aired live on Youtube and Instagram, also on HipTV and viewers could connect from the comfort of their homes. Interactions were also going on online as the show trended heavily on the day of the awards; Number 1 on the charts with the hashtag; #14th Headies. We still have not gotten over the fun memories and how the brand, Fearless, gave the physical attendees first-hand experience of the superb taste of their products; This featured cocktail and mocktail mixes to excite their taste buds and quench thirsts. Fearless Energy Drink also sponsored the award categories “Song Of The Year” and had her Brand Manager present the awards on the night.
