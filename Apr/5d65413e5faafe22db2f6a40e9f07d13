The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has announced plans to create additional two thousand four hundred and twenty four polling units in Rivers State. The move takes the total number of polling units in the state to six thousand eight hundred and sixty six. The Resident Electoral Commission, REC in Rivers State, Obo Effanga who made the disclosure in a media briefing in Port Harcourt, said the last time additional polling units were created in Nigeria was twenty five years ago. In his words, “We know where the new polling units will be created and that is what we are implementing” “Currently in Rivers state, there are four thousand four hundred and forty two polling units and based on the lower threshold of five hundred and higher threshold of seven hundred and fifty registered voters determined by the commission, INEC looks to convert two thousand four hundred and twenty four voting points in Rivers state to polling units. “When this new proposed polling units are verified and ratified, the total number of polling units will be about six thousand eight hundred and sixty six and those number we believe will be adequate to serve the current registered voters of three million, three two hundred and eighteen thousand two hundred and seventy three.” The REC also announced that the continuous voter’s registration will commence on June 28, 2021 across the country, adding that all new registrants and current voters would be transferred to the new polling units where they fall into.
