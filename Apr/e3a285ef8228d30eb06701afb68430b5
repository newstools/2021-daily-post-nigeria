President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, has declared that the president will go for his routine medical checkup in 2022 and 2023. Onochie made the remark while rubbishing those wailing over Buhari’s medical trip to London. She said Buhari has seen his personal doctor since 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and would do same next year if he decides. The presidential aide stated this in a statement titled: “Next Year, President Buhari will go for a routine check-up. According to the statement: “We have been here since 2016. Its been the same wailing. So the response will also be the same “At least, once a year, People across the world see their personal Doctors especially one they have seen for about 40 years “@MBuhari won’t dump his doctor of about 40 years so that wailers can be happy. Thats blackmail. Thankfully, he doesn’t pay blackmailers “In 2016, I ran from one media house to the other, educating us on d psychology of d bond between a patient & his/her long-standing doctor “He went for #CheckUp in 2017, 2018, 2019 & in 2020, just before the pandemic. Same wailing and same explanations. “The fact remains that if @MBuhari
chooses, he will go for checkups in 2022 and 2023. He will go in 2014. He will continue to go. Its his choice to go or not to. “I don’t know any man who will accept a different barber to cut his hair if the one he is used to, is not available “Wailing cant take away his rights to see his personal doctors so wailers must get ready for two more years of wailing and fooling around.” Buhari had last week left Nigeria for London for his routine medical trip. Following his trip, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri led a peaceful rally to harass the president out of London. Omokri claimed that the peaceful protesters had placed Buhari under house arrest because he could not go out of the Abuja House in London.
