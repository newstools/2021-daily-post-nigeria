The National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control NAFDAC has warned Nigerians against the use of chemicals and additives in enhancing the taste of food and drinks. The Director-General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, gave the warning in a statement signed by its Resident Media Consultant, Sayo Akintola, on Sunday. The NAFDAC boss informed that preliminary investigations carried out in regards to a recent incident of food poisoning in Kano State was the result of the use of unwholesome additives and chemicals in food products. She recalled that three people died as a result of their consumption of such dangerous chemicals and that findings have been submitted to the Kano State government. Prof Adeyeye warned that many people now have their healths compromised and regretted the three fatalities recorded, “It is heart-warming to note that all the merchants of the deadly chemicals and additives have been apprehended while further investigation continues. “We are very particular about food additives, about the temperature at which food can be kept or about the expiration date of food. If all of these are violated, then there could be food poisoning,” she said. Prof Adeyeye informed that NAFDAC is now working in partnership with the Kano State government to prevent a reoccurrence of the March 11, 2021 incident.
