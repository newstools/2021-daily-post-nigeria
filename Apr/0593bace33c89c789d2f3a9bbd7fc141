The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has arrested 50 arms-bearing herdsmen. The Commandant-General, Ahmed Audi, made the disclosure on Wednesday in Abuja. Audu spoke while presenting licences to private guard operators. “We realised that some of them are into cattle rustling and kidnapping”, NAN quoted him as saying. The herdsmen were arrested in Ekiti, Borno and Cross River and some other parts of the country. Audi reiterated his determination to reposition the corps for optimal delivery on its core mandate. NSCDC chief stressed the need for synergy and intelligence-sharing between security agencies. The CG charged the private guard operators to support ongoing efforts against insecurity in Nigeria. Audi announced that their licences would be withdrawn if they engage in unethical practice. He warned them not to adopt the ranks or other accoutrement used in the military or paramilitary.
