Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has explained why he substituted winger, Christian Pulisic, during his side’s Premier League 5-2 defeat against West Brom on Saturday. Tuchel substituted Pulisic, who scored a goal against West Brom, before the start of the second half at Stamford Bridge. The American international was replaced by Mason Mount as goals from Matheus Pereira (2), Callum Robinson (2) and Mbaye Diagne gave West Brom all three points against Chelsea. But Tuchel is now saying that he substituted Pulisic during Chelsea’s defeat against West Brom because the 22-year-old complained about a hamstring problem. “Christian [Pulisic] did a sprint when he came back out for the second half and said that he felt his hamstring would not survive the game if he continued,” Tuchel said as quoted by Chelsea’s Fifth Stand App. “So we had to make the decision to substitute him right away.” Chelsea’s next game is against Porto in the Champions League last-8 first-leg tie on Wednesday.
