Tears of joy and thanksgiving flowed freely on Tuesday when a kidnapped 13-year-old boy, Gbolahan Ajibola was released by his abductors. DAILY POST recalls that Gbolahan was kidnapped by gunmen in military uniform on Saturday night at Destiny Estate, Obada-Oko, Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State. It was gathered that the abductors, who went away with the boy’s phone and that of his mother, demanded a ransom of N50 million for his release. In a video made available to DAILY POST, Gbolahan was seen as he alighted from a car in front of his parent’s residence. As he was sighted, there were jubilations among family members and relatives who came around to rejoice with the parents. The moment people rushed to hug the young boy, he burst into tears as others joined him in shedding what can be described as tears of joy. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed that the boy has reunited with his parents. Oyeyemi said no arrest has been made by the police at the moment. Reacting to rumours that millions of Naira was paid as ransom before the release of Gbolahan, Abimbola said “the police is not aware of any ransom paid”.
“There is no way anybody will involve the police in paying a ransom. We are not aware of that,” he quipped.
