The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) has claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari appointed Dr Isa Pantami as the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, as a continuation of the “Fulanistic agenda of islamizing the country by all means, including electronic digitization and communication.” MASSOB, in a statement signed by its leader Uchenna Madu, described Pantami as a Fulani terrorist apologist and an ardent promoter/supporter of radical and extreme Islamism. Madu said that “Pantami is a qualified and excellent tool in the hand of President Buhari in his primitive quest of making the Nigerian state as the permanent homeland for all Fulani scattered in West Africa.” The statement read in part, “It is only in the southern and middle beltan Christian-dominated regions that Pantami’s National Identification Number (NIN) registration was made extremely compulsory. “The NIN registration was an electronic digital instrument of monitoring the personal data of the people of southern and middle beltan regions. It will also be a major electronic means of disenfranchising the electorate from the southern and middle beltan regions and rigging the presidential election results of 2023 to favour the Fulani interest and Islamic religious agenda.”
