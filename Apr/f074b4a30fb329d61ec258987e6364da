Former Chelsea midfielder, Cesc Fabregas, has lauded N’Golo Kante’s performance in the Blues’ Champions League semi-final first-leg 1-1 draw with Real Madrid on Tuesday night. Fabregas hailed Kante as a ‘big game player,’ adding that the France World Cup winner always plays for two. The Spaniard, who left Chelsea in 2019 to join current club Monaco, said this in a tweet via his Twitter handle. Goals from Christian Pulisic and Karim Benzema ensured both Chelsea and Real Madrid played a draw at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano stadium in Spain. “N’golo has always been a big game player. Never doubt him. He plays for 2,” Fabregas tweeted. “A close game in Madrid means we’re set up nicely for next week’s 2nd leg at the Bridge.” Fabregas and Kante played together at Chelsea for two-and-a-half seasons, winning the Premier League title, FA Cup and Europa League trophy together. Kante has stayed on at Stamford Bridge since Fabregas departed to France to join Monaco and has now formed a fixed central midfield partnership with Jorginho in the heart of Thomas Tuchel’s side.
