The Reno Omokri-led protest against President Muhammadu Buhari in London, United Kingdom, has continued on Thursday. Recall that Some Nigerians in the United Kingdom had stormed the Abuja House, 2 Campden Hill, Kensington, London demanding for president Muhammadu Buhari’s repatriation. Reno Omokri, a former presidential aide, had said they were there to chase the president back home during the protest tagged “#HarrassBuharioutofLondon.” Following the protest, DAILY POST reported on Monday that Buhari’s supporters stormed the Abuja House in London where the Nigerian leader is said to be going through a routine medical check-up with placards praying for the President. It was a counter-rally, in the wake of a protest by an anti-Buhari group led by Reno Omokri. And on Thursday morning, Omokri shared another video with DAILY POST, with the protesters gathering at the same venue, vowing to harass the Nigerian leader back to his country. They are making numerous corruption allegations against the current administration.   A post shared by nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen)
