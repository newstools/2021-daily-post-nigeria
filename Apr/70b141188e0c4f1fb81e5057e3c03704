Chelsea have suffered a fresh injury setback after their defender, Andreas Christensen, picked up a hamstring injury in training ahead of their Champions League quarter-final second-leg clash with FC Porto on Tuesday night in Sevilla, Spain. Christensen sustained the injury before Chelsea’s Premier League 4-1 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday evening. The centre-back was missing from the Chelsea squad that defeated Crystal Palace at the Selhurst Park Stadium as they boosted their top-four hopes. His absence from the match was a surprise after the Blues manager, Thomas Tuchel, confirmed he had a fully fit squad. However, the 25-year-old was replaced by Kurt Zouma at the defence line. A brace from Christian Pulisic and a strike from Kai Havertz and Zouma gave Chelsea all three points against the host. Tuchel will welcome back Thiago Silva on Tuesday against Porto. Tuchel’s men had won Porto 2-0 in the first-leg last week.
