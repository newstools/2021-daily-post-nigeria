Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has admitted that his team struggled to impose themselves, as they lost 1-0 to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. The defeat ended City’s quest to win a Quadruple this season. Hakim Ziyech scored the only goal in the second half, as Guardiola’s men were eliminated in the semi-final for the second successive year. “We played a good last 15 minutes. We had struggled to find our place in the pockets but congratulations to Chelsea, tight game. “We arrived sometimes in that position but after that, we didn’t create. “We conceded the goal but after we reacted well, especially after Phil Foden and Ilkay Gundogan came in. The team that defends with eight players in the final third is not easy. In this type of game, the margin is so tight. “In general we controlled well. We didn’t create many clear cut chances but we arrived more than them,” Guardiola said afterwards.
