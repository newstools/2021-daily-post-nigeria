Former presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has urged the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government to address the issue of insecurity. Atiku said investment opportunities are eluding Nigeria due to leadership failure to address insecurity in Nigeria. He made the remark while reacting to Nigeria being named in the global terrorism index. In a tweet, the former Vice President pointed out that the unemployment rate of the country would continue to worsen and poverty will keep rising due to insecurity. He wrote: “Yes, the challenges we face are enormous. But they are surmountable. “What we need is the leadership and the will to do what is right for our country and its people. “But for as long as we do not address this worsening state of insecurity, the investments needed to lift our nation out of its current abyss shall continue to elude us, unemployment will worsen, and poverty rife.”
