That’s proper sitting on the fence, isn’t it…?! “If West Ham avoids defeat in this game, then I think it’s on. Sipping an Estrella on the beach in Barcelona!’ Commenting on the Leeds vs Man United match, Cole said, “I’m going to go with Leeds. I just think Man United might have other things on their mind. “They are safely in the top four, they have got the semi-finals next week. “Knowing players at that stage of the season. And Leeds are the sort of team where if you are on it, you will beat them. If you’re not, you won’t. That is because of the way they play. “The energy, Bielsa gets them at it. They are one of my favourite teams to watch.” The kick-off time for Leeds United vs Man United 2 pm, while West Ham vs Chelsea is 5.30 pm.
