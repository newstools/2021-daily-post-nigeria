Chelsea star, Kai Havertz, has made a fresh promise to continue improving and giving his best in his new role for the club. Havertz made the vow ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League quarter-final second-leg tie against Porto on Tuesday night. The Germany international produced a fine performance for Thomas Tuchel’s side as they defeated Crystal Palace 4-1 in the Premier League over the weekend. Havertz, who was deployed in a central striking role against Crystal Palace, told reporters at his post-match press conference: “I like it, I think it is a good position [as a central striker] for me. I have the freedom to go everywhere I want to go. “As a striker, it is always easy to play with players of those qualities. “I know we train it very often in training, but after one game, when you win 4-1, it is easy to say we are a good attacking team. But we have to prove that on Tuesday again and on Saturday again and after the season we can speak about it. “After such a game, it is easy to say that I am at my best. I think I have to prove it in more games than only one, but I will give my best. I will try to improve, and I hope that I will continue like that.”
