India is grappling with the second wave of COVID-19 infections that has caught the world’s attention. On Tuesday, the world’s second-most populous country reported more than 259,000 new cases and 1,761 deaths in one day. It is the sixth straight day the daily infections surpassed 200,000. There are fears the case will remain the same in the coming days. Since the start of March, India has reported more than 3.1 million new cases and over 18,000 deaths. The surge has been linked to political rallies and religious events where large crowds gather, most of them without masks. Shortage of hospital beds and oxygen have been reported amid an allegation that the government was diverting oxygen meant for medical use to industries. Some states are under partial lockdowns and social restrictions, including India’s richest, Maharashtra, the worst hit with one million new cases in April. Also affected by the rise in infections are the capital Delhi, and the most populous state, Uttar Pradesh.
