The All Progressive Congress ( APC), Akwa Ibom State chapter has nullified all the factional leadership earlier constituted at different stakeholder meetings in the state. The party which said the decision became necessary to restore sanity to its coffers, rejected the leadership status accorded to Senator Godswill Akpabio during one of the factional stakeholders’ meetings in the state. The State Caretaker Committee Chairman of APC, Dr. Ita Udosen during the 2nd stakeholders meeting held in Uyo on Sunday said all the factions would be collapsed in one fold to avoid disunity and crisis of confidence that robbed the party of victory in the state in 2019. He added, “the current party structure in the state is under a caretaker arrangement with less than three months or so to go. For now, the party at the National level has no BoT nor Caucus. In the same vein, the party at the state is yet to set up its caucus as well.” An eight-point, communiqué issued and adopted at the end of the stakeholders meeting read in parts, “the State Executive Committee (SEC) of the party, therefore, appeals to all our leaders to sheath their swords on this issue until the congresses are conducted for a substantive structure of the party to take over. “The SEC of the party wishes to reaffirm its earlier stand regarding the purported leadership declaration of March 28, 2021, as a nullity and of no effect till such a time the state party caucus will be constituted, inaugurated and would meet with SEC to decide on the leadership of the party in the State. “This will preferably take place after the Congresses and will convey legitimacy on whosoever will emerge.” The APC commended the national leadership and appreciated the National Secretary senator John James Udoedehe for supporting the party in Akwa Ibom.
