Popular Nigerian rap artiste, CDQ, was on Friday night arrested by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency NDLEA, for allegedly being in possession of Cannabis in Lagos. The spokesperson of the agency, Femi Babafemi, during an interview with newsmen said the agency got information that the rapper was in possession of the banned substance and stormed his Lekki home and arrested him. Babafemi said he has been granted bail but is expected back in custody today as he is still under investigation. “Yes, CDQ was arrested in his house at Lekki for being in possession of cannabis. He was arrested based on credible information on Wednesday night but he was granted administrative bail. “He is expected back into custody on Thursday because investigation is still ongoing. “Some substances were found and he mentioned some names of some other big artistes,” he said. Babafemi further noted that the outcome of the investigation would determine if the rapper would be charged to court or counselled by the agency. Meanwhile, the rapper in a post via his Instagram last night said some persons were trying to set him up. He, however, didn’t state if it was in connection with his arrest. “No sleep for the wicked. Iyalaya yin o ni sun for this Lagos. They are tried to set me up today but Olohun wa sure for me,” he wrote.
