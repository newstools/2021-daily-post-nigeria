Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, has issued a strict warning to all private guard companies operating without mandatory operational requirements. This was stated in a statement by Jigawa State Command of the NSCDC, signed by its Public Relations Officer, SC Adamu Shehu, issued to DAILY POST. He said the command issued one-month ultimatum from 1st of April, 2021, to 30th, for all private guard companies operating in the State to fulfill the mandatory operational requirements or risk closure. “The command observed with dismay that some private guards companies are operating in the state without mandatory training to its personnel,” he stated. He said this was in line with NSCDC Act 2007 as amended, that empowered the Corps to monitor and supervise the activities of Private Guard Companies as stated in Section 3(1) subsection (b), (c) and (d). The Command enjoined all operators in the State to validate their licenses, avail guards for training, Open State Operational offices, and fulfill all other written operational guidelines as enshrined in the PGC Act. Adamu said the decision became necessary in order to enhance the operational performance and effectiveness of the companies, bring about professionalism, and instill public confidence.
