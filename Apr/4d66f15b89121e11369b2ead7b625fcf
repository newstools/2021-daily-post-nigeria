Clergyman, Mike Bamiloye, has revealed why many ladies are yet to get engaged to their life partners. In a post shared on his IG page, the clergyman opined that many ladies get delayed in getting engaged because they did not stick to God’s choice for them. According to him, those ladies instead set themselves up for ungodly and carnal standards that God’s choice cannot meet. “Some women’s delay in getting engaged or finding a life partner is from God but for a good number of woman, their own delay is their fault. “These set of women have refused to discern when God’s choice shows up in their lives. “Some of them can never figure out when they meet a man God has for them because they have set for themselves unGodly and carnal standards that God’s choice cannot meet,” he said.
