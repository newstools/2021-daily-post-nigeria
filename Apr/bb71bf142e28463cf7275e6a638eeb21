Isabelle da Silva, wife of veteran Chelsea defender, Thiago Silva, has attacked Timo Werner over his missed chance during Chelsea’s 1-1 draw with Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final first leg in Spain on Tuesday evening. Christian Pulisic put Chelsea ahead but Karim Benzema scored Madrid’s equaliser to make it 1-1. Before that, however, Werner had a clear chance to put the Blues ahead but missed the excellent opportunity from close range. And Isabelle da Silva, who was watching the game at home with her children, was less than impressed with the Germany international’s latest miss. In a video uploaded to her Instagram account during the first half, Isabelle da Silva said, “This is karma, guys. Every team I go to there is a striker who keeps missing goals… this Werner, what is his name?” She added in a second video, “We need a goal, we need to win this match but my attackers don’t want to score, I don’t know why they don’t score.”   A post shared by nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen)
