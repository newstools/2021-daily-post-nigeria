Students of Adeyemi College of Education in Ondo town, Ondo State, have been banned from driving cars and as well riding power bikes within the school. According to the management of the institution, the move became expedient due to the recklessness of some of the students when driving on campus. A circular issued by the school authority says that the management considers the ban necessary in order to safeguard the lives of students and staff from students who drive with ‘reckless abandon’. The circular signed by the registrar of the institution, O. O. Fakorede, noted that management had on several occasions received complaints from both students and staff of the institution over the menace, hence the ban. The circular partly reads: “The College management has observed that students who own cars and power bikes drive their cars and ride their power bikes on campus with reckless abandon. “As a consequence of this, and in order to safeguard the lives of students and staff, management hereby bans students from bringing their cars or power bikes into the College premises.”
