Former Bayern Munich defender, Bixente Lizarazu, has slammed Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar after the Brazilian was sent off during his side’s 1-0 defeat against Lille in a Ligue 1 tie on Saturday. PSG was defeated at the Parc des Princes following Jonathan David’s first-half goal as Neymar and Tiago Djalo were sent off late in the second half of the match. Neymar saw red in stoppage time of the game after getting revenge furiously following a rough challenge from centre-back Djalo. Reacting to the development, Lizarazu said Neymar goes crazy as soon as things don’t turn out in his favour, adding the 29-year-old’s behaviour is not ‘teammate behaviour’. “As soon as things don’t turn out in his favour Neymar goes crazy,” Lizarazu was quoted by Téléfoot as saying. “He tripped when he was back after two months of injury and preparing for a Champions League match. He is a fantastic player, but his behaviour is not teammate behaviour.” PSG’s next game is against Bayern Munich in the Champions League last-8 first-leg tie on Wednesday.
