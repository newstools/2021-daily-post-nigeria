The leadership of the All Progressives Congress Governors’ Forum (PGF) has urged APC Caretaker Chairman and Yobe Governor, Mala Mai Buni to roll out a timetable for the party’s congresses. Salihu Lukman, PGF Director-General, said it was high time the party held its national convention. Lukman described the extension of the ongoing membership registration, revalidation and register update exercise as unnecessary. DAILY POST reported the disquiet in the party over the purported plan by the Buni-led committee to stay longer in office. The National Executive Committee (NEC) had extended the tenure of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) till June. On Monday, Lukman warned that any attempt by the team to delay the election of new leadership would be resisted. In a statement titled ‘APC’s litmus tests’, the DG said the CECPC was yet to address the challenges that led to the dissolution of the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC). He said most decisions taken so far “by the Caretaker Committee were done by the Chairman, His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni and the Secretary, Sen. Akpan Udoedehe.” “In order to ensure that no extension is being considered, Committees for Congresses and National Convention should be established without any further delay. “Under no circumstances should there be any contemplation of extending the tenure of the Caretaker Committee”, the statement added.
