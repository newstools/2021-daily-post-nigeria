Biafra Nations League, BNL, has revealed its plans to completely shut down the Gulf of Guinea on May 30, threatening to hoist the Biafran flag. The group pleaded with travellers to exercise patience and not to travel to the area from 7am to the 12am on the said date. The group said it would carry out its threat of hoisting the Biafran flags in Bakassi Peninsula to mark the Biafra Day memorial. Chief Head of Operations of BNL, Henry Edet, in a statement to DAILY POST on Thursday, said this was also among decisions reached by the group during the visit of the National Leader of BNL, Princewill Chimezie Richard and his Deputy, Ebuta Akor Takon to Isangele, a town in Bakassi Peninsula controlled by Cameroon. Edet said the BNL would shut down waterways leading to Port Harcourt, Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea for five hours until the flag is hoisted. They warned that the “security operatives in Nigeria and Cameroon should respect themselves on that day and allow the peaceful activities to avert clashes that may lead to loss of lives. ” “Similar programs would hold in Ikom, Cross River State and Ahoada, Rivers State by our members who intend to gather to mark the declaration of Biafra.” The group said their activities for the Biafra day would be peaceful.
