The Police in Ogun State has rescued the two Chinese nationals recently abducted in the Oba area of the Obafemi Owode Local Government. DAILY POST reported last week that gunmen invaded the Ogun community through the river and snatched their targets. However, police said the two victims were rescued on Tuesday without the payment of ransom to the kidnappers. Ogun Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed that they were rescued from their captors following serious efforts by men of the state police command. “We even employed the use of helicopter that we have been using to search for them since two, three days ago,” Oyeyemi told newsmen.
