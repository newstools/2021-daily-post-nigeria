Rep. Yusuf Gagdi, Chairman, House Committee on Navy, says the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government has not failed Nigerians. The Pankshin/Kanke/Kanam federal constituency representative spoke with reporters on Wednesday in Abuja. The All Progressives Congress (APC) member said there was a communication gap between the people and the government. The lawmaker noted that government should have been informing Nigerians about its achievements. “I can tell you where the country was before Buhari took over in 2015. The APC government came in at a time when people had had to battle with the failures of the last administration. “A government with crude oil price of 100 dollars per barrel should not be measured with the one with 22 dollars barrel of crude oil per day”, NAN quoted him as saying. Gadgi said the greatest mistake of APC led government was that it had no economic team during its first tenure. He insisted that Buhari had performed more than the previous administration in terms of infrastructure development. In February, Gagdi boasted that the APC will hold power in Nigeria for 100 years.
