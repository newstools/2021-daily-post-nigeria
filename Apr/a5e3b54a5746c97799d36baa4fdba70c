Inter Milan could be Italian champions this weekend for the first time in over a decade. Antonio Conteâ€™s men are away to bottom club Crotone on Saturday. Victory there would see them put one hand on a title they last won in 2010. If they win and second-placed Atalanta fail to claim all three points at Sassuolo on Sunday, Inter will clinch their 19th Serie A crown with four games to go. Inter could also be crowned champions with a draw if Atalanta lose. But other results would have to go their way. Nezazzuri finished one point behind Juventus last year and also lost the Europa League final to Sevilla.
