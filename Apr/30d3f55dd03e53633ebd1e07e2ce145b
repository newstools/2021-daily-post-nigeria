Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has urged Nigerians to embrace unity despite the ethnic and religious differences. Ortom spoke on Tuesday during the inauguration of the rehabilitated 7.9 kilometers Oha/Orerokpe/Oviore Road and the bridge in Okpe Local Government Area of Delta State. The governor noted that injustice and bias were responsible for the agitations for secession by people in most of the geo-political zones. NAN reports that the governor promised to continue to preach unity of Nigeria. “We are better as a country”, he said. “Let there be justice for all irrespective of our ethnic and religions; we should be united as a nation. God has been with Nigeria and will never abandon our country. “What is happening today, I believe when God arises, enemies of this country will scatter and we shall have our peace.” Ortom commended Governor Ifeanyi Okowa for the infrastructural development in Delta.
