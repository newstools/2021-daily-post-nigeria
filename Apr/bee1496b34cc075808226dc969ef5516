Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said he will never select any player who is “at risk”. Solskjaer stated this on Wednesday while answering questions at a press conference over Marcus Rashford’s fitness. Rashford will travel for the team’s Europa League quarter-final against Granada on Thursday night in Spain. He scored United’s equaliser against Brighton on Sunday but came off after being caught in a tackle and missed training on Tuesday. With Anthony Martial injured, Rashford is hoping to lead United’s attack, alongside Edinson Cavani. “Marcus is travelling and we’ve just got to make a decision tomorrow if he starts or if he’s on the bench. “I don’t pick players when we know there’s a risk,” Solskjaer said. “Of course there’s always a risk when you step onto the pitch and when you play football. “But if the physios and the medical advice is that ‘this is too much of a risk to play him, I will never ever play a player that we, in advance, know about if it’s going to make it worse or if it’s a serious one. “Marcus joined in training this morning so let’s see how he reacts. If there’s any risk of making this worse, I’m not going to overplay him.”
