The All Progressive Congress (APC) Governors Forum has donated the sum of N50 million to the Zamfara State government to assist in rebuilding the Tudun Wada market that was gutted by fire last week. The forum led by its chairman, Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State donated the money at the Government House in Gusau, saying the gesture was made not considering that Zamfara is now a PDP state. Governor Bagudu noted that the forum came to Zamfara State from Katsina where they visited they inspected a recent fire incident which also consumed a market. In his response, Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle expressed doubts over the gesture saying he was not sure if the gift was a ploy by the APC Governors to lure him into their fold. “Still I commend the APC because I am not an APC member but they paid a solidarity visit to me and my state with N50 million” “As I am talking to you, no PDP state has visited Zamfara since the inferno occurred in Tudun Wada market last week” Matawalle said since the APC Governors brought the N50 million to Zamfara State, it could not be returned. DAILY POST reports that the delegation on the visit includes Governors of Kebbi and Jigawa States as well as the Acting national chairman of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Governor of Yobe State, Alhaji Mai Mall a Buni. The delegation after the occasion commissioned some housing units constructed by Governor Bello Matawalle at the Government House in Gusau, the state capital.
