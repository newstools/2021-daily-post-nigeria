The Department of State Services (DSS) has denied torturing Sa’idu Afaka, President Muhammadu Buhari’s driver to death. In a statement, Peter Afunanya, the Public Relations Officer, insisted Afaka was never arrested or detained by the Service. The spokesman said “it is a known fact” that the agency does not torture suspects. “Its suspect handling method is usually in compliance with the tenets of the criminal justice administration system and democracy,” he said. Afunanya referred to the announcement by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, that Afaka died after a prolonged illness. The DSS reportedly arrested Afaka months ago and tortured him for allegedly tricking Buhari to sign a fraudulent document linked to oil contracts. The deceased was allegedly abandoned in an apartment at the Aso Drive DSS quarters till he became sick. The agency was accused of moving Afaka to the State House Clinic, where he died, instead of a hospital for proper medical treatment.
