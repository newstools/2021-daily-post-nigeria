FC Porto defender, Pepe, has predicted his team to win the Champions League this year. Pepe believes Porto can eliminate Chelsea from the Champions League last-8 and win the Europe top-flight trophy this season. The former Real Madrid star said this on Tuesday during his pre-match press conference ahead of Porto’s Champions League quarter-final, first-leg tie with Chelsea on Wednesday night in Seville. Recall that Bayern Munich is the reigning champions after beating PSG 1-0 in the final last season. Pepe said, “If I did not believe it [that Porto can win the Champions League], I would not wake up every day to come and train at Olival [Porto’s training ground] with the passion I have for football. “I always believe that it’s possible to win the Champions League with FC Porto. “The credit is due to our coach, who makes us the first to believe his ideas. Today there are no easy games, and there is a lot of evidence for that. “Believing in our work and strictly following what the coach asks of us, we always have many possibilities to win games and to overcome challenges like this. “Chelsea has a squad that is valued at almost 700 million euros, but that does not matter. We all know that Chelsea have great players, but we’ve prepared the game well, and we will see what happens in the 90 minutes.” Porto had knocked Juventus out from the Champions League last-16 in March.
