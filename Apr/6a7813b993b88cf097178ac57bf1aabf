West Brom manager, Sam Allardyce, has hailed his team’s finishing, following their 5-2 win at Chelsea on Saturday. Allardyce, before the game, admitted he was “jealous” of Thomas Tuchel’s array of top talents at Stamford Bridge. However, it was the Baggies who put up a show against the Blues on their own turf, to end Tuchel’s unbeaten start as manager in West London. Thiago Silva’s red card made it easier, but West Brom showed both their tactical discipline and clinical attacking play. “I am really pleased and satisfied about how the players applied our tactics today, how we set out to control Chelsea’s attacks and then what we could do in possession of the ball. “Because we ended up being so good in possession of the ball on so many occasions, and because of our quality of finishing, which was the best it’s been since I have been here, it was a thoroughly deserved victory. “Of course people will always look to the fact they went down to 10 men, but I’ve been manager of many teams with 10 men that have won and not lost – we took full advantage after that,” Allardyce said.
