Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has confirmed that striker, Anthony Martial, will miss his side’s away Premier League clash against Leeds United on Sunday afternoon. Solskjaer also provided the latest update on Marcus Rashford and Eric Bailly ahead of the Leeds United clash. Man United head to the game after defeating Burnley 3-1 in their previous Premier League tie last Sunday. “Yes, Eric is back and has been training this week,” Solskjaer told the club media on Friday. “It’s been a good week.” “Marcus has not trained, but I hope that he will join us tomorrow,” Solskjaer added. “Apart from that, everyone – of course Anthony is injured still – has had a couple of days of recovery and a week of preparation and training. “You need that against these. They make you go to the edge physically and mentally. “They have a unique style of play, and it is a game we are looking forward to.” The kick-off time for Leeds United vs Man United is 2 pm.
