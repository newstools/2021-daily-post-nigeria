The Osun State Police Patrol has allegedly chased to death a middle-aged man, Taiwo Kajogbola along Kajola/Osunjela road. DAILY POST gathered that the deceased, who was riding a motorcycle at the time of the accident, was going to give his parents some food to break their fast on Sunday. A source said the deceased allegedly refused to stop at Kajola for a stop-and-search at the checkpoint when the police stopped him on his way back to Osogbo. His refusal to stop prompted a hot chase by the police who purportedly hit his bike from behind when they caught up with him at Osunjela, leaving him in a pool of blood. Reports say the officers, having realised the gravity of the incident, made a U-turn and left the scene. Kajogbola was unlucky as he did not survive the incident. He reportedly died after some good Samaritans took him to the hospital. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, SP Yemisi Opalola said she just received information on the incident but assured that investigation is ongoing to unravel its details.
