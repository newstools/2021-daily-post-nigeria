Chelsea fans in their numbers have gathered outside the club’s home ground, Stamford Bridge to protest against the Blues participation in the European Super League. Europe’s big clubs such as Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, Inter Milan, AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Tottenham and Chelsea have on Sunday announced their plans to breakaway from UEFA and form a new league known as European Super League. The protesting supporters gathered outside Stamford Bridge ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League match against Brighton. The angry fans held banners calling on the club’s owner Roman Abramovich to ‘do the right thing.’ As the crowds increased, fans took part in a sit down protest which effectively caused the closure of the Fulham Road, while Chelsea legend Petr Cech, currently the club’s technical director, confronted the crowds and attempted to appease them. Under the new format, an elite group of clubs would compete against each other without the threat of relegation, earning vast sums of money and limiting entry to just five other teams.
