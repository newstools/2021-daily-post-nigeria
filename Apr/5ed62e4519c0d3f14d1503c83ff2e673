Juventus manager, Andrea Pirlo, has admitted he made many mistakes in his first season at the club. But according to him, he would do it all over, as they are helping his learning process. Juve beat Napoli 2-1 on Wednesday night, to move into third place in Serie A. Pirlo’s men were dumped out of Europe by Porto and their chase for a 10th straight league crown will almost certainly come up short. “I made many mistakes, but I’d make them all again,” Pirlo told Sky Italia. “This is my first season, I needed those experiences for the present and the future. “This was a more complicated campaign not just for me, but for many other coaches too. Everyone makes mistakes, including me, but I can learn from those and not repeat them in future.”
