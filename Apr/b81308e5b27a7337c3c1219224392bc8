The Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers says allegations against Governor Kayode Fayemi over alleged plans to cede lands to some persons for cattle ranching or grazing is not true. The Council says Governor Fayemi has no plans to cede an inch of the stateâ€™s lands to any group of people for ranching as alleged.

The Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, who is the Chairman of the State Council of Traditional Rulers, HRM Oba Adebanji Ajibade Alabi, AFUNTADE 1 made the clarification while reacting to a statement issued by the Olomuo Oke of Omuo Oke, HRM Oba Vincent Otitoju and Secretary, Onikun of Ikun Amure Ekiti Oba Olatunde Olusola and some Obas. Oba Alabi revealed that available information from the government indicated that the alleged plans were meant to cause disaffection among our people. The Chairman of the Traditional Council appealed to monarchs to show some circumspection in reacting to news culled from Social media in this era of misinformation, disinformation and fake news. The Alawe said the State Council of Traditional Rulers at its next statutory meeting in April 2021 will be properly briefed by top officials on Government policy on Animal Husbandry. The Chairman of the State Traditional Council appealed to all traditional rulers and the various communities in Ekiti to remain calm adding that there was no need for alarm or tension on ranching as the Governor has made it abundantly clear that no part of the land would be ceded.
