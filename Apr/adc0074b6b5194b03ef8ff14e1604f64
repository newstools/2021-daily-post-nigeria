Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has provided the latest injury update on Midfielder, Luka Modric, ahead of his side’s UEFA Champions League, UCL, semi-final first-leg clash with Chelsea on April 27. Modric missed Real Madrid’s LaLiga 3-0 victory against Cadiz on Wednesday. Providing an update on Modric during his post-match press conference, Zidane said the Croatia international has a back injury. The Frenchman, however, hoped that the 35-year-old would join the rest of the Los Blancos squad soon ahead of the Chelsea clash. “It’s his back,” Zidane said after Real Madrid defeated Cadiz. “But I think it’s only a small thing. I hope we can be back with us soon.” Meanwhile, Real Madrid eliminated Liverpool from the Champions League quarter-final earlier this month, while Chelsea knocked FC Porto out of the competition.
