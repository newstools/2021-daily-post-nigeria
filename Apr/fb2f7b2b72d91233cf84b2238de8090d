There was violence at the Iyana-Iba area of Lagos on Monday as commercial motorcyclists aka okada riders and thugs clashed. Trouble started following complaints about alleged illegal taxation by ‘area boys’ working for a transport union. The free-for-all led to the destruction of properties and barricading of roads by the thugs. Tyres, woods, and other items were set on fire. The fight later became an ethic brawl as the opposing factions – Hausas and Yorubas – were joined by their people from their regions. Machetes and other dangerous weapons were used. The violence spread to Volks, Alaba Rago and Okoko. However, the Police has restored calm. Lagos Police spokesman, Muyiwa Adejobi, said the incident was under control. But, it is still unclear if there were casualties from the incident.
