Arsenal midfielder, Lucas Torreira, has said he wants to join Boca Juniors in order to be closer to his family, following his mother’s death. In an emotional interview with ESPN Argentina, Torreira who is currently on loan at Atletico Madrid, confirmed his mother had passed after a battle with COVID-19. The Uruguay international also admitted he has long dreamed of playing for Boca, and he intends to fulfil the wish of his father by returning to South America. Torreira said: “I am trying to understand the situation. It is difficult to come to terms with it but as time passes, we will come to live with this pain. “My mother was 53 years old and died from Covid. There was an outbreak in Fray Bentos (Torreira’s hometown in Uruguay) and she spent 11 days fighting but on Monday morning I received the worst news. “I asked Atletico for some time off. Cholo (manager Diego Simeone) understood everything and they gave me a week, but I asked to stay for a little longer. On Sunday I will probably return. I have to do my duty and life must continue. Atletico have been very good to me and it’s important. “It’s not a violent emotion, a crazy decision because of my mother. I have always said that I want to play for Boca. I’m dying to play for Boca and I will always say it. The night my mother died, one of the first to hear the news was my agent. I don’t want to play in Europe anymore, I want to play for Boca.”
