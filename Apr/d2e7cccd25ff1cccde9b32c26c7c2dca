A group within the All Progressives Congress (APC), ‘APC Patriots’, has warned the leadership of the party to avoid the bait of imposing a candidate on its members in the forthcoming governorship election. The Anambra State chapter of the group issued the warning in a press conference they addressed in Awka at the weekend, saying that doing so may cause implosion in the party. Addressing journalists on behalf of the group, a chieftain of the party and a member of the steering committee of the group in Anambra, Hon Chidi Ogbaji said: “The only way we can make headway in the Anambra governorship election is by having a credible primary election, which will also throw up an acceptable candidate. “APGA has failed Anambra State and the people are yearning for a change and APC has so far positioned itself well, and is now being accepted by the people. “We will not let that goodwill be spoilt through the imposition of an unpopular candidate. “What we are doing today is to alert the leaders of the party that we are watching. APC Patriots have so far positioned themselves as a third force in the party, so the people must know that we are watching. We hope things will go right.” Asked if the group thinks the people will accept the party, considering some leadership lapses at the national level, Ogbaji said that could not be used to judge the party in the state. “It doesn’t mean that the APC is a failure or that it will fail in the state. All presidents have their weaknesses and strengths, so does Buhari’s government. You can not use his weakness to judge the party in the state.” He added that the array of refined personalities seeking the ticket of the party for the governorship election is proof that any leader from APC can not fail. He said the group will on the 27th of April host all the aspirants of the party in Abuja and avail them of the platform to sell their personalities to the leaders and delegates of the party.
