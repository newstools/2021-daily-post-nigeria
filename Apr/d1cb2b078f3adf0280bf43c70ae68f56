Paris Saint-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has hailed Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola as the best manager in the world. Both coaches will go head-to-head in the Champions League semi-final. Pochettino insists they will have to beat the best coach on the planet if PSG are to reach the final in Istanbul. The former Tottenham Hotspur boss, who famously knocked out City in the 2019 quarter final, said: “For me, he is the best. I admire him. “I think he’s doing a fantastic job not only in Manchester City but before with Barcelona and Bayern Munich and I think he’s an amazing coach with an amazing coaching staff too because I know all the people who work with him. “For me, he’s a fantastic manager and he’s a coach always thinking of doing different strategies and different game-plans. “It’s many things. He is a very intelligent coach. Who works really, really hard with all the coaching staff. A club like Manchester City that really gives him all the confidence to take all the decisions and be the real boss, that is the most important too.”
