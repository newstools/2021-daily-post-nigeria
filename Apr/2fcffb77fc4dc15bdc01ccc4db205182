The member representing Bosso constituency, Hon. Malik Madaki Bosso has accused the State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello of frustrating the financial autonomy for the legislative and judicial arms of the state government. Bosso who made the allegations in Minna said Nigerian governors were consistently showing citizens that they are the modern-day emperors and not democrats. The lawmaker said if governors are allowed to get away with the constitutional breaches, then the future of democracy was not certain. “This is a constitutional issue. It is in section 121 of the constitution. If they had anything against the provision, they should have opposed it during the constitutional amendment instead of putting us in this quagmire. If they are going to chose which section of the constitution they will respect or not, then we are heading into anarchy”. Malik said if ordinary citizens can be jailed for breaking local government bye-laws, he does not see why governors should be allowed to walk free for breaking the supreme laws of the land, which was contained in the constitution. He said the next amendment that should be done in the Constitution was to remove immunity for governors. “if immunity clause is removed from the Constitution and the judiciary and legislature were fully granted autonomy and Independence, then the type of democracy we all desired will be entrenched and the impunity of governors will be curtailed.” He, however, called on the judiciary to wake up from slumber to defend and protect the laws of the land, adding that he was fully in support of the industrial actions embarked upon by both the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) and the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN).
