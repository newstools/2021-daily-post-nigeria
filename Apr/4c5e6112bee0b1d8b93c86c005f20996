The Chidi Ibeh-led Ohanaeze Ndigbo, on Saturday, paid a sympathy visit to the Imo State Correctional Service Centre, which came under attack recently. On the visit were the President-General, Ibeh, the Secretary-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, among others. DAILY POST recalls that unknown gunmen had attacked the prison facility, as well as police command headquarters in Owerri, the Imo State capital, setting free hundreds of inmates. Speaking during the visit, Ibeh said “we have come and we met with the Deputy Comptroller, and he has been able to explain to us what happened, how the unidentified hoodlums came and gained access into the facility. “But one thing we must do, is to thank God that we didn’t lose the life of any of the staff here, even the inmates we did not lose anyone. It is the handwork of God. “We are here to ascertain the extent of damage and it is unfortunate that this building was touched very badly. I’m appealled to the Federal Government to upgrade this place from medium to maximum status, so that other facilities could be brought in to forestall future incidents like this.” He also called for the immediate relocation of the Correctional Service center to a new location.
