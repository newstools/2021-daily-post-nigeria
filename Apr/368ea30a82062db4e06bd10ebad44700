Former Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, has delivered his verdict on Chelsea midfielder, Billy Gilmour. Gilmour broke through into the Chelsea first-team last season. He produced consecutive Man of the Match performances against Liverpool and Everton prior to COVID-19 lockdown. A knee injury in July set the 19-year-old back, which has limited him to just ten appearances for Chelsea so far this season. Speaking on a Euro 2020 show ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League tie with West Ham on Saturday evening, Ferguson offered his assessment on the Scotland youngster. “He’s another one that’s emerging,” Ferguson said. “I saw him play for Chelsea towards the start of the season, and he did well.” “He got an injury that held him back a bit, but he is an emerging player there’s no doubt about that. It’s good to see players like him coming through and the quality of players in England. “We are blessed with some good young players coming through.” Gilmour has been restricted of minutes under Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, after opting not to go out on loan last January transfer window.
