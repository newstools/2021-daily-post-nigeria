Manchester United legend Roy Keane has lambasted Tottenham forward, Son Heung-Min after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side had an Edinson Cavani goal disallowed for a foul from Scott McTominay. Cavani thought he had put Manchester United ahead ten minutes from half time when the Uruguay international slotted home from a superb pass from Paul Pogba pass down the inside-left channel. However, Cavani’s goal was ruled out after a VAR review that showed McTominay had caught Son in the face. And Keane, a Manchester United legend was furious about the ref’s decision and Son’s attitude, describing the South Korean international as ’embarrassing’ for the way he rolled around on the pitch. “I’m amazed really,” Keane told Sky Sports. “I have to say if this is a foul then we should all go home. “It’s really bizarre for a player like Son to roll around like that – it’s embarrassing. ‘Obviously, it’s great movement from Cavani but that can’t be a foul. How a player can stay down there. “It’s not just Son – Rashford did it ten minutes earlier. Both sets of players were rolling around screaming. “The ref is under huge pressure and he’s doubting every decision he makes now but clearly he’s got this wrong.”
