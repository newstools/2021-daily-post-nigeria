Jose Mourinho has signed up for a punditry role with talkSPORT, over a week after he was sacked as Tottenham Hotspur manager. The 58-year-old was fired by Spurs chief, Daniel Levy, six days before Spurs took on Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final. Despite getting paid £20m in compensation from Spurs, Mourinho has now taken up a new role with talkSPORT and admitted he “misses football already”. In a clip posted to the broadcaster’s Twitter page, Mourinho said: “I am totally absorbed by football. I just love to work. “In this moment, I am not working for a week and I am missing it already.” Mourinho has already turned down the chance to be Celtic’s new manager.
