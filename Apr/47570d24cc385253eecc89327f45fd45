Nigerian seasoned football manager, Henry Abiodun, has given reasons why Chelsea might still end up not winning the Champions League title this season. Having secured a 2-0 away win over Porto in the first leg of the competition’s quarter-final, Chelsea secured a place in the semi-finals on Tuesday despite losing 1-0 to hard-fighting FC Porto. Chelsea are currently having an impressive run under Thomas Tuchel losing just once in their last 18 fixtures in all competitions. The Blues have been tipped by several fans and pundits to win Europe’s elite competition for the second time in their history having first won it in 2012. And Abiodun, who is the director of coaching education at Football Coaches Association of Africa Nations (FCAAN), has explained why the Blues may not conquer Europe despite their impressive form. “…Chelsea have struggled with their attackers. Judging from recent games, you would realise that most of their goals are scored from the midfield and by defenders. “This means that the strikers have not been consistent enough in getting goals. That can hurt them in their quest to be crowned as European champions. “Another thing that can hinder their ambition is that most of their players are very young and they have been together for just a very short time. Experience counts as the tournament progresses to the semi-final. “It will be a tough one but in the game of football, impossibility is nothing.” The Blues are now waiting for the outcome of the Champions League quarter-final tie between Real Madrid and Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday to know the semi-finals opponent.
