Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has revealed striker Edinson Cavani asked to be named among the substitutes against Burnley. Cavani started on the bench for the game at Old Trafford, but came on to score the third goal for United as they won 3-1. Mason Greenwood had netted a brace either side of a James Tarkowski header. Solskjaer has now spoken about managing 34-year-old Cavani’s fitness carefully. He said: “We’ve got to manage him well. He’s not played or started three games in a week for a long time, so when I spoke to him he felt being a sub was the best thing. “With Marcus, it’s a long time since I’ve asked him how you are and he’s said good.”
