The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has called on the Federal Government of Nigeria to recognise COVID-19 (Coronavirus) as a workplace disease, notifiable and compensable occupational hazard. The NLC President, Mr Ayuba Wabba, disclosed this in a statement commemorating the 2021 International Workers Memorial Day, with the theme “Save Lives at Work,” on Wednesday in Abuja. Wabba stated that this was significant coming at the epoch of the global fight against the virus. According to him,”The contribution of frontline workers, especially healthcare workers, is a formidable buffer between deaths in thousands and deaths in millions. “Everyday, our healthcare workers courageously dare the stare of death in selfless service to rescue the lives of others. “The listing of occupational health and safety as a fundamental right at work and the recognition of COVID-19 as a workplace disease and as a notifiable and compensable occupational hazard is important. “Demand for compensation of COVID-19 victims in the workplace; adequate and Quality Personal Protection Equipment (PPEs) for workers at the workplace.” While labour expects actions on these demands, Wabba assured workers of its commitment to protecting their safety and health at work every time. Wabba said, “There is no better day to demonstrate our readiness to fight for the living than today. “We’ll fight for the living by highlighting the preventable nature of most workplace incidents and ill-health, to promote campaigns and union organisation in the fight for improvements in occupational safety and health in our different workplaces.”
