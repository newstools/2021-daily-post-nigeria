A 24-year-old Fulani herder has been shot dead in Ondo State by a hunter. The incident was said to have happened in Ifira Akoko in Akoko South East Local Government of the state. It was gathered that the deceased herdsman, Muhammed Maikudi was shot dead by a local hunter, identified as Seyiansere. Maikudi was said to be grazing his cows in the forest reserve within the local government when the incident happened. To douse tension in the area following the development, the state security outfit, Amotekun Corps and policemen have quickly waded into the situation to avoid clash within the community with Sansere apprehended from his hideout. With the deceasedâ€™s corpse already deposited at a government hospital morgue in the council area, a leader of the Hausa Fulani community in the state, Bala Umar appealed to Fulani settlers in the area to be calm and not take laws into their hands. He said the Police and Amotekun operatives had swung into action towards unravelling the circumstances leading to the killing of the herder by Sansere. The deceased, a father of two who hailed from Katsina State was said to have been engaged by one Alhaji Akerele, to graze his cows before his death. Meanwhile, the Police Public Relations Officer, Tee-Leo Ikoro said he was yet to be briefed on the incident. While emphasizing that it was not a case of a herder-farmer clash, the State Commander of Amotekun Corps, Adetunji Adeleye, said Sansere allegedly carried out the act while hunting in the forest. Adeleye said his men were not involved in the shooting of the late herder but only worked with the police to ensure there is peace in the area after the incident.
