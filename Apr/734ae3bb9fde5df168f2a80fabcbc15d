Legislative aides, on Tuesday, welcomed lawmakers of the upper and lower legislative Chambers with protest over non payment of allowances. The aides earlier positioned themselves and blocked the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila whom they said has been feigning ignorance of their demands since 2019. Having done with the Speaker, protesters made deft moves to get the attention of the Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan. They are yet to be attended to as of the time of this report.
