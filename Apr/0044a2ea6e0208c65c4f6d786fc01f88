The Kaduna Police Command has described as fake, the news making the rounds on social media that the State Deputy Commissioner of Police went to give firearms to kidnappers. ASP Mohammad Jalige, Police Public Relations Officer, in a statement said the image in circulation was not that of any Police Officer in Kaduna Command or anywhere in Nigeria. It stated that the image in circulation is not in any way connected to a Deputy Commissioner of Police in Kaduna as portrayed in the report. “The attention of the Kaduna State Police Command has been drawn to a fake news making round on social media tagged “Kaduna State Deputy Commissioner of Police went to give firearms to kidnappers; unfortunately he was arrested with them.” It explained, “The image with camouflage uniform wearing the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police is one Kinsley Udoyem who was arrested and paraded by Akwa-Ibom Police Command on the 2nd January 2019 for the offence of impersonating a Police Officer.” The Command said it is using the opportunity to advise members of the public to disregard and discontinue the circulation of the unfounded image as there is no iota of truth in it. The Command called on the general public, particularly social media users to be positive while circulating unsubstantiated content in the public domain as it is capable of truncating the cordial relationship between the Kaduna Police Command and members of the civil populace.
