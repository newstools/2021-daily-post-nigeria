Paris Saint-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has criticized his players, including Neymar, after his side’s Ligue 1, 1-0 home defeat against Lille on Saturday. Pochettino explained that PSG players didn’t create enough chances against Lille, adding that they showed a lack of aggression in the final third of the encounter against the visitors. Jonathan David’s first-half goal gave Lille all three points against PSG at the Parc des Princes as Neymar, and Tiago Djalo were sent off late in the second half of the match. The result means PSG are in the second position on the Ligue 1 table with 3 points behind leaders Lille after 31 games. “We didn’t score, and they did. They created fewer chances than us, but they were more clinical in front of goal,” Pochettino said at his post-match press conference after the game. “I think we deserved more at least a point or even three. In the end, we lost, and of course, we are very disappointed with the result. We did not create enough. We created more than them but not enough, and maybe we showed a lack of aggression in the final third. We were thinking that with the dominance, we would score, but in the end, the time ran out, we did not score, and we lost the game. “It’s going to be difficult. We knew very well that it was going to be tough until the end and of course we need to keep going and think of all competitions. We have got the Champions League coming up, so we’ll focus on that.” PSG’s next fixture is against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday.
