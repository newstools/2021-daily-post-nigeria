The Zamfara State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has suspended its Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Farouq Shatiman Rijiya over alleged unacceptable public comments This was disclosed by the state secretary of the party, Hon. Ibrahim Umar, during an exclusive interview with DAILY POST in Gusau. He said the party suspended him over his comment on a video that went viral on social media, alleging that the PDP led government in Zamfara was not carrying the party along in most of its decisions. The Party’s Secretary said Rijiya’s uncontrolled statement was capable of causing injuries to the cordial working relationship between Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle’s government and the PDP. “The resolution for the suspension was reached during an emergency meeting held on Thursday by the executives of the state chapter of the party” Hon. Umar noted that it was clearly on record that the PDP is active and alive in Zamfara State more than ever before as Governor Matawalle often considers the party’s interest in his decisions. The party, however, said the politician will be recalled as soon party secretary said, as soon as executives meet and discuss the matter. He promised that the party’s next line of action would be made public.
