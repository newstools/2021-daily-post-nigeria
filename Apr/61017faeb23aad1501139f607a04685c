Arsenal hero, Paul Merson, has backed Mikel Arteta’s side to beat Slavia Prague when both teams clash in tonight’s Europa League quarter-final second-leg clash at the Eden Arena. Arsenal had played a 1-1- draw with Slavia Prague in the first-leg last week at Emirates Stadium. The Gunners head to the game following a 3-0 win over Sheffield United in the Premier League last Sunday. “It’s a big game (against Slavia in the Europa League quarter-final, second leg), but at the end of the day, you can only play with the hand you are dealt,” Merson told Sky Sports. “There are a lot of players who are there before he [Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang] was there, and I feel for him in a way as they are so up and down. “They should have finished the game against Slavia last week, the chances they missed, and Alexandre Lacazette is an absolute sitter when he hit the bar. It’s ridiculous. “They are tenth in the league, and this is Arsenal, let us not forget. I wouldn’t say get rid of Arteta if they lost this game, though, not a chance. “But I think they win this game [against Slavia], there is a lot of turning around there, but they’ve to start getting a 5-year plan. “This will not happen overnight, these need to start now because at the moment, they’re relying on Bukayo Saka, who is their go-to man, and Emile Smith Rowe when he plays. And no disrespect, that shouldn’t be the case.”
