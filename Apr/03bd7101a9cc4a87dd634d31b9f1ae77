Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State, on Friday, alleged that politicians are sponsoring the activities of bandits. Uzodinma claimed that politicians are funding banditry to run down President Muhammadu Buhari’s government. The governor spoke while addressing journalists after a closed-door meeting with Buhari at the State House in Abuja. He also urged security operatives to publish the names of those sponsoring bandits in the country. Uzodinma said, “What people are doing is to sponsor crisis to the extent that those funding bandits are politicians and I challenge and call on the security agencies to make their names available to the press because what they want to do is to distract a government that is focused. The Northern part of the country recently experienced an upward surge in the activity of banditry. Katsina, Niger, Zamfara and Kaduna States have recorded more casualties. On Friday, the Kaduna State government disclosed that three out of the students abducted from a private university in the state by bandits were discovered dead.
