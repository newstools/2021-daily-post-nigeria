The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, OYC, has condemned the fracas witnessed in Enugu on Thursday involving Hausa-Fulani cattle dealers at the New Artisan Market, Enugu. DAILY POST reported that an attempt to relocate the traders following a court order was stoutly resisted, with some of the dealers shooting AK-47 rifles. They were said to have destroyed vehicles, including the bulldozer deployed for the enforcement, other vehicles and properties after chasing the police away. Reacting to the development after visiting the area on Friday, the OYC in a statement signed by its President-General, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, and the Secretary-General, Comrade Obinna Achuonye, said the incident was unacceptable. “We are irked over the news that some cattle dealers of Northern extraction resisted valid court order to the extent of brandishing AK-47 rifles and chasing security operatives away. “This go a long way to confirm earlier allegations that the New Artisan Market has turned into a breeding ground and hideout for criminals. “We have not forgotten how a policeman on lawful duty was killed within the same location. This latest incident is now a confirmation that Enugu is sitting on a time bomb. “To this end, we call on the Enugu State Government and security agencies to stop at nothing in ridding that area of hoodlums. Nobody no matter the origin who be allowed to take laws into their hands. “We urge the police to not only ensure the execution of that court order but also ensure that all the arms within that market are recovered. All those involved in the mayhem should also be arrested and made to face the law,” the group stated. The Igbo group equally condemned the attack on police formations in Anambra State and Uzo-Uwani in Enugu State, calling for an end to such act. “We have had enough of this carnage, as such we are appealing to the perpetrators to ceasefire, as no society can thrive in an atmosphere of anarchy,” the OYC noted.
