Former Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Anita Natacha Akide, also known as Tacha has taken a swipe at Nigerians who are calling for President Mohammadu Buhari’s resignation. The Reality Tv star, in a video shared via her Twitter handle, said Buhari is not going anywhere until he completes his tenure. She pointed out that the only way Nigerians can fulfil their dreams of having competent leaders in positions of authority is when they get involved in the election processes which includes coming out to cast their votes during an election. Tacha also slammed Nigerians who are always quick to go online to rant while taking a cue from a recently held by-election in Abia State where a small number of registered voters came out to vote. “Nigerians forming woke but na we silly pass. So now it’s Buhari must go that is currently trending. “Everyone in Nigeria knows that Buhari is not going anywhere until he completes his tenure so what is the need really? “There was a by-election in Abia state and out of 500,000 registered voters, only 16,000 came out to vote. That is like 3 people out of 100 people. It is as good as nothing. “How do we keep complaining about bad governance and we do not want to get involved in governance. “How do you get involved in governance? By seeing it as an obligation to use your voter cards to vote. The voter card is not going to vote by itself. You need to use it. “That mindset of ours need to change. We want good governance, we need to vote in good governance.” She said.
