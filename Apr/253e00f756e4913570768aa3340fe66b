There was a major battle between Nigerian troops and terrorists in Damasak, Borno, at the weekend. Ground troops and the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) eliminated scores of insurgents who stormed the area in five gun trucks. The terrorists looted humanitarian offices and killed two unidentified men. They stole an ambulance, a Jeep, burnt the residences of the Police DPO and a traditional ruler. Two soldiers were killed when they attempted to apprehend a man suspected to be a spy. An intelligence officer told PRNigeria that the civilian-led the sect members to warehouses looted. “Suspecting that the man was on a mission, rather than shooting him, the soldiers ran after him. The terrorists, in an ambush with gun trucks, opened fire on the two soldiers and the informant. “The ground troops with air support by NAF aircraft arrived timely enough to engage the gunmen, killing scores of the fighters and destroyed their five gun trucks. “Some other terrorists were hit close to the perimeter fencing, while others were neutralised while hiding in the blue roof compound.”. Terrorists attacked Damasak after gaining access by manoeuvring their way at checkpoints manned by Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) operatives at the west point. Intelligence sources believe they camped at Kareto, Jilli, and Bamma Bukar Lawanti in Magumeri LGA, before the assault.
