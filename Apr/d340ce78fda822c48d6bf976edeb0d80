Chelsea has offered West Ham United, three players, in a bid to sign their defensive midfielder, Declan Rice, this summerâ€™s transfer window. The players include Tammy Abraham, Christensen and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, according to the UK Express. Rice has been a long term transfer target for Chelsea. The England international began his career at Chelsea. The 22-year-old later joined West Ham after he was let go by the Blues as a teenager. Meanwhile, former Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, recently admitted that he truly wanted to sign Rice for the club during his time at Stamford Bridge. Lampard was dismissed by Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich in January after only 18 months in charge at the club and was replaced by Thomas Tuchel.
