Some Chelsea players have been left “confused” by manager Thomas Tuchel’s treatment of striker, Tammy Abraham. Abraham was a key player during former Chelsea manager Frank Lampard’s regime. The England international scored 18 goals in all competitions last season under Lampard. Abraham has fallen out of favour since Tuchel replaced Lampard last January. The 23-year-old has been left out of a number of matchday squads, most recently on Saturday for Chelsea’s 5-2 shock defeat to West Brom. Explaining Abraham’s absence in Chelsea’s defeat to West Brom, Tuchel said: “He was not in the squad. I have to nominate 18 players. “So we have to leave three players out, and Tammy [Abraham] was one of the three players. It’s nothing personal or nothing big.” However, according to the Daily Telegraph, Despite Tuchel attempting to downplay the significance of Abraham’s absence, his treatment of the forward has left a number of Chelsea players puzzled. This is coming ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League last-8 first-leg tie against FC Porto on Wednesday night. Abraham has also drawn interest from Leicester City and Aston Villa in the past.
