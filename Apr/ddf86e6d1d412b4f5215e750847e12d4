A 50-year-old Prophet in charge of one Cherubim & Seraphim Church, Oke-igbala in Ifo area of Ogun State, Tayo Shobowale, is presently cooling his heels at the police cell for allegedly defiling a 17-year-old girl. The Ogun State Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed to DAILY POST that Shobowale was arrested following a report lodged at the Family Support Unit of Ota Area Command by the victim. The teenage girl who was accompanied to the police station by her mother, had reported that, sometime in March 2021, the prophet invited her to the church for a prayer session. While the two were alone in the church, the girl alleged that, “the prophet took advantage of being alone with him in the church to forcefully had unlawful carnal knowledge of her,” Oyeyemi said. “The victim further stated that, after the illicit affair, the prophet ordered her to take a spiritual bath in the church with an already spiritually prepared candle, which he rubbed all over her body. Since then, the victim complained that she has been having spiritual attacks which always make her to fall down and remain unconscious for hours,” the victim was quoted as saying. Consequent upon her allegations, the Ota Area Commander, ACP Muhideen Obe, was said to have detailed his Family Support Unit to the scene where the “randy prophet” was arrested. While being interrogated, “the suspect initially denied the allegations, but when he was confronted by the victim, it was very difficult for him to absolve himself of the allegations,” the PPRO disclosed. DAILY POST learnt that the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, has ordered a thorough investigation of the case, with a directive that the suspect be charged to court as soon as the investigation is concluded.
