Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said the club does not need to spend £100 million on a single player to compete with the best teams in Europe. City’s record transfer remains the £63.6m they paid Atletico Madrid for Rodri in 2019. Guardiola was speaking ahead of City’s Champions League clash on Tuesday with Borussia Dortmund, who have £100m-rated striker Erling Haaland in their ranks. “Football is a team game, everyone makes his contribution. “The guys who doesn’t play makes his contribution, the backroom staff and everyone, so it’s not just one player, it’s for absolutely everyone. “So far the club has decided not to spend not close to £100m for a player, or more than £100m on a player, maybe in the future it is going to happen if they decide it is necessary to improve the team for the next five, 10 years, for many reasons,” Guardiola said.
