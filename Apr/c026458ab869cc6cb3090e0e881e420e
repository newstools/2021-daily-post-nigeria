Nigerian striker, Odion Ighalo, has claimed he rejected offers from West Ham and West Brom, to keep him in the Premier League. The 31-year-old also revealed he snubbed Tottenham Hotspur before signing for Manchester United. Ighalo completed a dream switch to United, a club he supported as a boy when a loan agreement with Shanghai Shenhua was reached in January 2020. That short-term deal was extended to January 2021, before he left for Saudi Arabian side Al-Shabab. “Yeah, there was the possibility of West Ham and West Brom to stay in the Premier League, which I thought about. “But after being at Manchester United, the biggest club in England if not the world, what else could I possibly do in the Premier League? “I had good offers to stay in England, but I just didn’t think I could stay after achieving my dream of playing for the club I had supported since I was young. “I came all the way from China because it was Manchester United when I had already rejected other offers because United has always been my dream,” Ighalo told Sky Sports.
