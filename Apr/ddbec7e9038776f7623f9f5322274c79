President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the attempted coup in Niger Republic. Buhari urged African heads to remain united against coups and warned plotters to learn a lesson from history on the consequences. His reaction was issued Wednesday night by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu. The Nigerian leader said any illegal effort to depose a democratically elected government was despicable and unacceptable. Buhari had a telephone conversation with Mahamadou Issoufou, the outgoing Niger President, on the situation. He warned that the international community is hostile to the change of government by violent and unconstitutional means. Buhari told military political adventurers to respect the will of the people and respect constitutional order. The President said he was particularly concerned about the negative impact of coups on African stability, peace and progress. He stressed that the involvement of the military in violent change is doing more harm than good to the continent. Several arrests have been made in connection with a coup attempt. President-elect Mohamed Bazoum is due to be sworn in on Friday.
