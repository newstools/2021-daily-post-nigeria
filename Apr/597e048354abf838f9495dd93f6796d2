Former Chelsea left-back, Wayne Bridge, has opened up on what he went through playing under Jose Mourinho. The former England International recounted how the Portuguese hauled him out of the pitch at half-time on several occasions without telling him why. Bridge said it could be very difficult playing under Mourinho because of his sometimes “harsh” treatment of players. He suggested that Mourinho may no longer be contacted by top clubs in the Premier League because of his harsh treatment of players. Mourinho was recently sacked as Tottenham manager and there are speculations regarding which club or indeed country he will end up at next. “When things have gone wrong maybe he hasn’t handled it the best,” Bridge told Bettingexpert. “For me, personally, it could be quite hard with him. I felt sometimes I didn’t get a lot from him and I didn’t know what I had to do. “There was one game in particular when I was dragged off at half time against Charlton. Not a word was said to me and I thought it was harsh. He dragged me off and I’ve seen him do it with other players before – he’s done it after 20 minutes. “When it becomes week after week and you don’t get anything from him, it does get difficult. Top Premier League clubs might not want to touch him.”
