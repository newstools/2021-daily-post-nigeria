Dutch legend Marco van Basten has told Hakim Ziyech to leave Chelsea, insisting that Thomas Tuchel is the ‘wrong’ manager for the Moroccan. Ziyech was brought to Stamford Bridge from Dutch giants, Ajax last summer and much was expected of him. But the Morocco international suffered injury and a lack of form which have seen him feature in just over half of Chelsea’s league matches. His goal against Manchester City last weekend put the Blues in the FA Cup final but the winger found himself back on the bench again on Saturday for the 1-0 win over West Ham. And Van Basten believes the 28-year-old should seek to leave Stamford Bridge this summer as he did not join the club to sit on the bench. “Ziyech again on the bench,” said Van Basten, according to Metro UK. “When he gets in, that’s like a striker. He can do that too, because he is just a good player. I am sad to see rotation… He’s just not in the right place. “That Werner plays really badly, but doesn’t he come in much more often? The system this trainer plays is just not good for Ziyech. “Then as Ziyech you have to say: ‘You know what? I have to plead [to leave]. It is now about Ziyech because I have nothing to do with that man. “This is not getting along like that. I’m not saying it’s bad for Ziyech or bad for that trainer, but it doesn’t work like that.”
