A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olumide Aderinokun has reacted to the incessant cases of kidnapping in Ogun State, blaming the Governor, Dapo Abiodun. The Ogun-born real estate mogul said he was holding “Gov Abiodun responsible for the high rate of kidnapping and insecurity in the state.” In a statement made available to DAILY POST in Abeokuta on Saturday by his media aide, Taiye Taiwo, Aderinokun expressed worry that due to the increasing cases of kidnapping in Ogun, doctors and nurses had embarked on strike, “leaving people in dire need of urgent health check-ups with no option.” According to him, the recently launched Amotekun Corps has not been doing enough in protecting Ogun indigenes from kidnappers. “Ogun state government can do better. Where is the recently launched Amotekun corps? Are they not funded with the state resources? So, why are they nowhere to be found,” Aderinokun asked. He maintained that Ogun indigenes and residents should be able to sleep with their two eyes closed after enduring their daily struggles without basic amenities, saying “Ogun people deserve better than this.” He recalled how two female students of the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ayetoro campus were abducted in March. “Last week Wednesday, a medical doctor and a nurse were kidnapped along Abeokuta-Imeko road. The kidnapping reports did not stop as a dental therapist working at the General Hospital in Ijebu-Igbo was abducted on Monday. “The APC-led federal government has shown incompetence in securing lives and properties across Nigeria but it should not be so in the Gateway State,” he stated. Aderinokun called on the Abiodun government to “stop playing politics with Ogun residents’ safety.” The head of Olumide and Stephanie Aderinokun Foundation, advised the government to train strong anti-kidnapping agents and create more jobs for the teeming youths.
