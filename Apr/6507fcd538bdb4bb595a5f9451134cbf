Justice Peter Kekemeke of the Federal Capital Territory High Court, Nyanya in Abuja, has convicted internet fraudster, Farouk Olamilekan. The Economic and Financial Crimes (EFCC) arrested Olamilekan on January 29, 2021, in the Mpape area of Abuja. Operatives stormed the location after intelligence on his academy where young boys were trained on internet fraud. EFCC counsel, Adeola Olanrewaju urged the court to convict and sentence the fraudster after he pleaded guilty. The defence counsel said his client was a first-time offender and prayed the court to temper justice with mercy. Justice Kekemeke sentenced Olailekan to three-month imprisonment with an option of N200,000 fine. The judge also ordered the convict to forfeit his Infinix Hot 7 mobile phone and the sum of N200,000 to the Federal Government of Nigeria.
