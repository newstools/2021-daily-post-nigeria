Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said Christian Pulisic can be a “huge weapon”, as the season enters its business end. The Blues were shocked 5-2 by West Brom in their Premier League game and gave up the fourth place as a result. However, Tuchel’s men bounced back with a 2-0 victory against FC Porto in the Champions League in midweek. Pulisic looked lively when he came off the bench against the Portuguese side, while he also scored in the defeat to the Baggies and appears to have finally overcome the injury niggles that have plagued his season. The American winger has only scored two goals in 20 league appearances, but Tuchel is hopeful he can reproduce that level of performance when they face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday. When asked if Pulisic can replicate his form from last season’s run-in, and how important his fitness is, Tuchel replied: “I think for Christian fitness is always important. “Especially for him, because he has this huge physical impact for us in the number of sprints and the amount of intensity that he can give to the team on the highest level. “This is one of his biggest strengths. And the other thing is that he needs to feel confident and he needs to feel calm mentally and then he can be a huge weapon for us.”
