Lack of adequate Gas Supply, coupled with Electricity Cables and Energy theft has caused poor power supply to the entire Kano State. Already, the Kano Kano Electricity Distribution Company, KEDCO, has appealed to its numerous customers to show understanding. According to the Company’s Spokesperson, Ibrahim Shawai, the thermal stations supplying the Grid which feeds KEDCO, had not been generating power due to paucity of gas to fire the power plants, hence the epileptic power supply. He said, “KEDCO doesn’t generate but distributes whatever has been generated for it and it is in that light that we are informing our customers the situation of things. “As we hope and await improvement in generation, we are herewith appealing to our numerous customers for their understanding, assuring that as supply improves, we will improve distribution too to guarantee satisfaction across our franchise.”
