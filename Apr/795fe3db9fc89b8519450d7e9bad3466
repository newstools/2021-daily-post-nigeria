Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation has condemned the reported suspension of Channels Television by the Nigerian Government. The National Broadcasting Commission, NBC on Monday in a letter to the Managing Director of Channels TV signed by the Acting Director General of the Commission, Prof. Armstrong Idachaba said Channels TV erred by allowing a leader of the Indigenous people of Biafra, IPOB to make secessionist and inciting declarations on air without caution. The government also announced a fine N5 million for breach of the broadcast code. Reacting, Fani-Kayode condemning the action said the censorship of the media is wrong and unacceptable in a democratic government. On his Twitter page, the former minister wrote: “It is wrong for NBC to sanction @channelstv simply because they allowed the spokesman of IPOB, Mr. Emma Powerful, to answer some pertinent and vital questions about the attack on the home of the Governor of Imo state. “Censorship of the media is unacceptable in a democracy.”
