Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has confirmed the latest update on his team ahead of the Gunners’ Premier League tie with Liverpool on Saturday night at Emirates. Arteta said Bukayo Saka has not trained with Arsenal’s squad ahead of the Liverpool clash, while Emile Smith Rowe has some discomfort in his hip. Arsenal head to the game following a 3-3 draw with West Ham United in their last Premier League encounter on March 21. “Bukayo has not trained with the team yet,” Arteta said at his pre-match press conference on Thursday. “He has been doing some individual work. “We had to pull him out of the England squad, unfortunately. He is feeling better, but he has not trained with the team yet. “Emile has some discomfort in his hip, and that is why they decided to keep him out. “We’ll see today how he comes here, we’ll speak with the doctors and the physios and see if he’s available for training tomorrow.” The kick-off time for Arsenal vs Liverpool is 8 pm.
