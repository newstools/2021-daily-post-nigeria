The South East Revival Group (SERG) has described ‘Ebube Agu’, the security outfit announced by South-East Governors as “another jamboree”. The organisation said the decision of the governors was meant to please the federal authorities. SERG President, Willy Ezugwu, in a statement, reiterated that the federal government failed in tackling the security challenges in the country. He noted that if anti-crime and counter-terrorism policies were working, there would be no need for calls for a special security arrangement in the South-East. “The SERG sees the latest move as yet another jamboree and a convenient political outing aimed at pleasing the federal establishment rather than the people of the region. “We practically pleaded with them since the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown to set off a central security outfit but it didn’t go well with them until the first Ebonyi herdsmen attack their host communities. “It was laughable that the governors ordered security agencies to implement a ban on opening grazing. Is there any law establishing Ebube Agu that has a clause banning open grazing?” SERG urged the people to prevail on the governors to enact laws banning open grazing and establish the security outfit in their respective states like Amotekun.
