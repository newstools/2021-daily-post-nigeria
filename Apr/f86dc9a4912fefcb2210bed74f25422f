Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has claimed he would “lose the team” if he does not start Zack Steffen in goal for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea. Steffen is now set to start at Wembley ahead of usual No.1 Ederson. The American stopper has played every round of this season’s FA Cup and Guardiola says his players would turn against him if he is dropped. “He will start, always I’ve done it like this. “Maybe we are going to win or we are going to lose, but if Zack doesn’t play I’m going to lose the team and it is better to lose a game than lose the team. “He played really well in the FA Cup, he’s a keeper from the national team USA, and when he plays, he plays at a good level. He is a lovely guy, training good and he deserves it. I’m more than delighted to give him the chance,” Guardiola told a news conference. Steffen has made 10 appearances for the Premier League leaders, after returning from a year-long loan at Fortuna Dusseldorf last summer. He has deputised for Ederson against Chelsea already this season in a 3-1 win at Stamford Bridge in January.
