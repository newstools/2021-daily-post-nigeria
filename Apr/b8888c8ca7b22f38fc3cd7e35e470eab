Shehu Sani, a former federal lawmaker, has reacted to the N5million fine placed on Channels Television for interviewing members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Sani, who represented Kaduna central senatorial district in the 8th assembly, believes that there was nothing sensitive in the interview, adding that NBC’s action will only lure more viewers and listeners to the TV station. DAILY POST reported earlier on Monday that the National Broadcasting Commission, NBC on Monday fined Channels TV N5million for allowing a leader of the IPOB to make secessionist and inciting declarations on air without caution. NBC had told the Managing Director of the TV station that it was allowing a leader of the secessionist group to make inciting declarations without caution. The regulator accused the news channel of allowing the guest speaker to make derogatory, false and misleading statements about the Nigerian army, despite being proscribed by a court of law. “There is nothing so sensitive, provocative or inciting about that @channelstv interview. The NBC’s action only now makes people want to listen or watch it,” Shehu Sani tweeted.
