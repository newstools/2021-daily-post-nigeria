Gunmen who invaded the residence of David Aigbefor, the Vice Chairman, Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Gwagwalada Branch in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), have been arrested. The suspected kidnappers were nabbed by the special anti-kidnap squad of the FCT Police Command. They will be arraigned at the end of investigation. Aigbefor fought the attackers in his apartment at Tungan Maje, in Zuba axis of Abuja. The gang gained access after shattering the entrance door of the living room with bullets. But they hurried out after a police team responded to a distress call and stormed the area. In a footage obtained by PRNigeria, Igbefo said he engaged the gunmen for 30 minutes, before men of the community vigilante group and the police arrived. “God delivered me. I was able to fight back even though they were wielding dangerous weapons. Using only a machete, I was able to strike, injured one of the kidnappers. “As you can see, these are bloodstains on the floor and walls of my living room,” he said in recording.
