Senator Ayo Akinyelure (PDP – Ondo Central) says the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Eyitayo Jegede will get a favourable judgement at the Court of Appeal. Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) won the October 10, 2020 election. The petition tribunal declared him winner this week. Akinyelure, in a statement by his spokesman, Charles Akinwon, predicted that the verdict will be overturned. The lawmaker advised PDP members in Ondo not to be discouraged by tribunal judgment. “Members of our party should be hopeful because I have the assurances that Eyitayo Jegede (SAN) will still carry the day at the Appeal Court”, Akinyelure said. The Senate Committee Chairman on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions, described Jegede as ‘God-sent’ to rescue Ondo. Akinyelure added that the PDP flagbearer would increase the fortunes of the state and the party.
