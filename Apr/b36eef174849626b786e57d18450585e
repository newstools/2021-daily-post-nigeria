Nollywood actress, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, has said no lady who is financially unstable should consider marriage. The actress said this in a recent interview with BBC Yoruba revealing that she got married at 18 because she was a millionaire. According to her, any woman who is considering marriage without being financially stable is automatically preparing herself to be imprisoned in the union. The actress said: “One should not marry a man when one is not financially stable. If one does that, one would be going into slavery or better still, prison. “One must apply wisdom or common sense in everything one does. People cannot say that because I married at 18, therefore they can also do the same. The question is, ‘are you ready for marriage’? When I was 18, I was ready. “I had been working since I was 15-year-old and I became a millionaire at the age of 18. That is a fact that a lot of people do not know. “I had my own money. I was not dependent on any man. Moreover, I lost my father at an early age, so I was already responsible for my younger siblings. I was like their mother at that time, so I was very mature and financially prepared.”
