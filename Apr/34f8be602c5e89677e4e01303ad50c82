Former Liverpool manager, Graeme Souness has named the current Manchester City squad as the best in the history of the English Premier League. Souness hailed Pep Guardiola, City manager, for having assembled and parading an ‘incredible’ array of players. City were defeated 2-1 by Leeds United at the Etihad on Saturday but still maintain 14 points lead on the Premier League table. Apart from the Premier League title, City are still in the race to clinch the Champions League, League Cup and FA Cup trophies this season. And Souness, who noted that Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea have the second best squad in the league at the moment, insisted that City are simply operating on another level. “They’re in a great position,” Souness told Sky Sports of Chelsea. When you look at the team that started for Chelsea today and the subs. “I would put Chelsea in having the 2nd best squad in the Premier League behind Manchester City. “City have got an incredible squad, I would go as far to say it’s the best squad I’ve ever seen in English football.” While Manchester City lost 2-1 to Leeds, Chelsea beat Crystal Palace 4-1 away from Stamford Bridge. Both clubs will now focus on their Champions League quarter-final second leg ties against CF Porto and Borussia Dortmund respectively.
