There is tension at the Bayelsa State-owned higher institution, the Niger Delta University (NDU), following the shooting of a 300 level student, James Okunmakpeye, during lectures by suspected cultists. The deceased, James Okunmakpeye, a student of marketing at the Faculty of Management Science of the Institution, was shot in the head at close range and the bullet tore through the right eye at about 11am while standing by the door of a class during lectures. DAILY POST, learned that many of his classmates and lecturer, scampered out of the lecture room for safety, while the body of the deceased was left in the pool of his blood. Some students who witnessed the killing were seen crying and lamenting the violent loss of life. An eye witness while narrating the incident said ”we were in the lecture and at a point everywhere was quiet, the next noise was a gunshot, we all had to scamper for safety first before we came back to see who was shot. When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of the Institution, Ingezi Idoni, who confirmed the development assured DAILY POST that authorities of the institution were investigating the incident and have contacted security personnel on the development. Idoni said the deceased was shot dead during lecture hours, “there was a lecturer in the class during the incident. He was shot by the door of the lecture room. He was late to the class and was being asked to come into the lecture hall, and while he was offering reasons for his lateness, someone came from behind and shot him.” “The culprit after carrying out the dastardly act ran towards the Ogunbiri side of the institution where the perimeter fencing has failed and escaped. We are using this opportunity to call on the State Government to assist the Institution in the completion of the perimeter fencing of the institution to assist in proper security of lives and property of the institution.”
