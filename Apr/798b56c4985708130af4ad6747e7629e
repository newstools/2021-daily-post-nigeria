Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has claimed he knows why his team failed to close out its games, but he may never reveal them. Spurs have dropped 18 points from winning positions this season. Only Brighton (20) have a worse record. The latest came last weekend, after they took a 1-0 lead against Manchester United at home, but ended up losing 3-1. Although Mourinho insists he understands the root of the issue, he declined to explain. “I know why it happened. I know also you can look at it from a different perspective,” Mourinho said on Thursday. When asked to explain the reasons, Mourinho added: “That’s what I’m not ready to discuss with you. I think it has to do with some of our qualities as a team but I’m not ready to discuss with you.”
