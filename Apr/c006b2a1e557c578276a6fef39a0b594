Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, has vowed to ensure that popular actor, Olarenwaju James, also known as Baba Ijesha, rots in jail for allegedly defiling a 14-year-old girl. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, had disclosed that the actor started sexually assaulting the teenager when she was seven-years-old. The actor confessed to the crime after he was captured by a CCTV camera in the house of the complainant. Speaking on his arrest, Tonto in a post on her Instagram page, vowed to ensure that Baba Ijesha is not granted bail if found guilty of rape. Her post read, “If the allegations are true, I hope he rots in jail and they do the same thing to him when his soap drops. If it is true, I will personally make sure he never sees the light of day.” Dikeh also urged women to show solidarity over the matter, stressing that Baba Ijesha must not be released on bail. “We will come together as women, stand up and use our voices to make awareness of what this man has done. Anyone with information on this, please contact me. “This evil man must not be released nor granted bail. They may tweak the law to his favour as a celebrity, what we should all do is repost this and tag foreign and local authorities,” she said. According to her, the actor must not be spared because of his celebrity status. “He raped us all when he raped her. Mothers, come out, they have stabbed us. This is the face of a celebrity rapist. This is the face of evil that pleasures himself with a seven-year-old for seven years. “He is a Nollywood/Yoruba actor (I do not know him, never heard of him either). He may be your favourite star. Have you heard what he did to the life of a seven-year-old girl? He raped a seven-year-old girl for seven years,” the mother of one wrote. Meanwhile, the case has been transferred to the Gender Unit of the State CID, Panti, Yaba Lagos for proper investigation.
