The Noble Youths Mass Support Association (NYMSA) has endorsed former presidential aide, Doyin Okupe, for the 2023 presidency. The Coordinator, Godwin Onmonya, told NAN that the group believes in hope in the ex-National Publicity Secretary of the National Republican Convention (NRC). Okupe worked with former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan. Onmonya described Okupe as a reliable and credible choice for the office of the president. NYMSA said Okupe will create an enabling environment for businesses, restore respect for the rule of law and provide job opportunities. “He is a thoroughbred grassroots politician, who understands Nigeria, Nigerians’ challenges and can provide acceptable solutions to them all”, Onmonya added. In the Second Republic, Okupe was a House of Representatives candidate of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) for the 1983 parliamentary election. Onmonya urged the people to get their Permanent Voter’s Card (PVCs) ahead of the polls.
