Saâ€™ad Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto, has sighted the moon signalling the beginning of Ramadan. The Sultan in a live broadcast on Monday announced that the Ramadan fast will begin on Tuesday. He advised Muslims to ensure strict adherence to the COVID-19 protocol during the Ramadan period. The beginning and end of Islamic months are determined by the sighting of the new moon. Muslims during Ramadan abstain from eating, drinking, smoking and sex from dawn to sunset. Muslims usually have evening prayers by large social and religious gatherings, but due to COVID-19, restrictions would limit some practices for the second year.
