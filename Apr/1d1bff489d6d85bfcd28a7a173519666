The lawmaker representing Lagos Central District at the Senate, Remi Tinubu, on Tuesday, knocked Senator Smart Adeyemi (Kogi West) for speaking out on the spate of insecurity across the country. Senator Adeyemi had aired his opinion on Nigeria’s security challenges while contributing to a debate at the floor of the Senate. The Kogi West lawmaker called on the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government to seek foreign help without further delays. Recall that Niger State Governor, Sani Bello, on Monday, lamented that the Boko Haram are two-hours from Abuja, the nation’s capital and had hoisted its flag in the Shiroro Local Government Area of the State. Adeyemi, who replaced Senator Dino Melaye as Kogi West representative at the red chamber, had said, “This is the worst instability we are facing. In fact, this is worse than the civil war.” However, Mrs. Tinubu, the wife of the national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, attacked her party member, asking: “Are you in PDP? Are you a wolf in sheep’s clothing?” However, the Kogi lawmaker and APC chieftain overlooked the Lagos lawmaker’s comments and continued his passionate speech. DAILY POST reported that Adeyemi went ahead to say that the government cannot pretend that they are capable of handling the situation at hand, adding that America, as powerful as they are, when the pandemic came, it came to a point China came to their rescue. “We shouldn’t pretend that we need foreign support now. Billions of naira have been voted for security services and nothing is coming out of it. “I’m a party man and I’m supporting APC but it has gotten to a point that as supporters we cannot keep quiet,” he had said.
