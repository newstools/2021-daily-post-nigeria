An unspecified number of corpses were found in a small valley in mile five, Calabar Municipal local government area in Cross River State. The corpses, some beheaded were discovered on Tuesday morning by farmers who went to their farm in the morning “The dead bodies comprising males and females were dumped in the steep valley along the double carriageway under construction by Governor Ben Ayade” an eyewitness alleged Though the identity of the bodies or those who dumped them, is still unknown, it was learned that some of the bodies have started decomposing. When DAILY POST visited the scene, some security personnel were seen directing traffic and controlling the crowd. An eyewitness who preferred anonymity said “Some persons may have brought these corpses and dumped them here in a vehicle last night” he alleged A taxi driver said that the people may have been killed by unknown people and brought to this lonely area. “I wonder why police and security agents who mount roadblocks along this road could not intercept them because the odour that emanates from such bodies can be very strong* When contacted via phone on Monday, the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo said it was not true “there is nothing like that” she claimed.
