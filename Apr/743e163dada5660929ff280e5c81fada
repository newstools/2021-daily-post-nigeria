A pregnant woman, other women and minors have allegedly been kidnapped by suspected gunmen who invaded a low-cost housing estate in Zaria Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Sources told DAILY POST that the gunmen stormed the community around 9:30pm on Sunday and began shooting sporadically. The source alleged that the gunmen operated for about four hours before security operatives arrived to rescue the people. It was alleged that the gunmen entered from one house to the other in search of people to abduct. The source explained that most of the men were either out for prayers or had not come back from work when the bandits decided to abduct women and young children. The gunmen, according to the source, numbered about 70, came on motorcycles and Keke (tricycles) and encircled the entire community. The source explained, “They shot four persons. The victims are now receiving medical attention at Gambo Sawaba General Hospital.”
The source confirmed that three of the gunmen have been arrested. The State Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, ASP Mohammed Jalige, confirmed the attack, assuring that only four persons were abducted. The PPRO assured that the police are on the trail of the gunmen, vowing to rescue all the victims safe and alive. The suspected kidnappers, who dressed in women’s outfits, were said to have left behind braziers and hijab in a house as they fled.
