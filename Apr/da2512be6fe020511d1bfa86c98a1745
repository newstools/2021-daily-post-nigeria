Some of the matches include the clash between league leaders, Manchester City against third-placed Leicester City, defending champions, Liverpool vs Arsenal, Newcastle vs Tottenham, Chelsea vs West Brom and Aston Villa against Fulham.

Berbatov said the Leicester v Man City game will end in 2-1 in favour of the Foxes over Pep Guardiola’s side. For the game between Arsenal v Liverpool at the Emirates, Berbatov said “This is going to be another good game to watch,” he told Metro UK and predicted a 2-2 draw. Others are:
