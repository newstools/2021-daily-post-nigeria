President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with Queen Elizabeth II over the death of her husband Prince Philip. The Duke of Edinburgh died on Friday at Windsor Castle in England at the age of 99. The Nigerian leader, in his message, said Philips passing was the end of an era. He noted that the Duke was one of the greatest international figures whose contributions to the Commonwealth will be remembered for generations to come. “Prince Philip was a great man in his own right who made enormous contributions to philanthropic activities and charities especially for wildlife conservation and youth development programmes in more than 130 countries.” Buhari said the late Duke’s long marriage to the Queen was “an impressive record for any marriage at any level.” The President extended his condolences to the Government of the United Kingdom and the members of the Commonwealth.
