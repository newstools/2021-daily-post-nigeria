The governor also anchored his defection reports to his recent visit to APC’s National Secretariat with those who made the party a stronghold in the state. A statement by Onwuemeodo reads: “Governor Hope Uzodinma can not and will not blackmail Senator Rochas Okorocha out of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Governor Uzodinma was behind the fake story of Senator Rochas Okorocha leaving the APC for the PDP, last Monday. “He had come up with the fake story of Okorocha leaving APC because the National Secretariat of the Party had set up a reconciliation committee. “And also because of Okorocha’s visit to the National Office of the Party, with men and women who had sacrificed all they had, to make APC the Party to beat in Imo. And with National Assembly members who have the mandate of the people.” The senator recalled that Uzodinma was never an APC member but joined the party after Supreme Court’s ruling in the party’s governorship candidate in 2019.
