Chelsea star, Jorginho has spoken of the moment he scored the winning penalty against Spain to help Italy progress to the final of the Euro 2020 championship. After playing out a 1-1 draw, both heavyweights settled for a penalty shootout after 120 minutes of enthralling action. Italy goalkeeper, Gianlugi Donnarumma saved Alvaro Morata’s kick with Jorginho stepping up to seal his country’s place in the final. And the Brazilian-born Chelsea midfielder found the back of the net in the most nonchalant fashion. “When you take the kick, you feel this weight fall off your shoulders! I tried to forget everything around me, focus on what I’d trained to do, took a deep breath and got on with it,” Jorginho told Sky Sport Italia. “It was a struggle against a great team that made us run so hard, we knew we’d have to suffer, but we believed to the end and in my view deserved to win.”
