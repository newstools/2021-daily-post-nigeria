The Rivers State Police Command is investigating a case of alleged rape of a 22-year-old girl by a General Overseer of one of the new generation churches in Port Harcourt. The case was reported to the police by a civil rights group, Centre for Basic Rights Protection and Accountability after it got wind of the incident. The spokesman of the Rivers State Police Command, Nnamdi Omoni has confirmed receipt of the petition and has also summoned the suspect to the command. Narrating her ordeal in the hands of the pastor on Wednesday, the victim said the pastor conspired with a female choir member in the church to rape her. She said she honored the invitation from the pastor through the female choir member in the guise of resolving an issue which she had with the pastor’s wife. According to her, “the pastor told Joy Favor to tell me to come for the resolution of the issues in the compound because I had a quarrel with the pastor’s wife. Joy Favour even told me that the pastor’s wife and other members of the church will be around for the meeting. “When I got to the venue, I was told that there was no issue to be resolved, that I must agree with whatever they tell me to do. “After that the women held me very tight while the pastor locked the door, increased the volume on the television and switched off the light. The Favour and one other woman held me while the pastor raped me. “After everything, they now told me that I’m not going out, they brought out a black substance and gave to me that I should swear that whatever happened in the place that day that I should not reveal it to anybody or else I will die and the lives of my sisters will be at risk.” Meanwhile, the civil rights group who read the petition on behalf of the victim has called for a “thorough investigation” into the matter.
