The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, has said that vehicles with factory-fitted tinted glasses are exempted from getting police permits. Baba made this clarification during a virtual interaction with select journalists on Monday. The IGP also reiterated that the police were concerned about tinted glasses that are not factory-fitted because operatives cannot see through such vehicles. Baba said: “Factory-fitted tinted glasses are not affected. “They are not the ones we are quarrelling about because you can see through most of the factory-fitted glasses. “If you want them to open, you can then ask them to open. We are talking about the ones you cannot even identify, whether there’s someone inside or not.” DAILY POST reports that IGP Baba had last month suspended the issuance of tinted glass permits and spy number plates to individuals in Nigeria. He affirmed that all existing vehicle tinted glass permits, duly issued by the Nigeria Police Force, remain valid. Insecurity: Niger State Police stops issuance of tinted glass, spy number plates
