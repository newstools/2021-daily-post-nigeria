Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has given his verdict on the penalty awarded to England in their Euro 2020 semi-final 2-1 victory over Denmark on Wednesday night. Wenger said the penalty awarded to England against Denmark by referee, Danny Makkelie, was not a penalty, adding that the referee should have had a look at the screen. DAILY POST reports that the referee pointed to the spot, judging Joakim Maehle to have clipped Raheem Sterling.

Harry Kane’s penalty was saved by Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, but he converted the rebound to seal a 2-1 victory for England and end their semi-final hoodoo. “No penalty,” Wenger said on beIN SPORTS. “I don’t understand why they don’t ask the referee to have a look at it. “In a moment like that, it’s important that the referee is absolutely convinced that it was a penalty. It was not clear enough to say: ‘yes it is,’ and at least he should have had a look on the screen. “I don’t know why the VAR didn’t ask him to go. For me, it was no penalty, no. I think that VAR has let the referee down, not Denmark. Denmark is a bit unfortunate. “I understand that it’s difficult for the referee, but he must have a look at it.”
