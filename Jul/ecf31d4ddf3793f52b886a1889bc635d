The Adamawa State Police Command has nabbed an 18-year-old housewife for allegedly pressing a hot iron around the private part of her five-year-old step-daughter. The police said the housewife did this because the stepdaughter urinated in her bed. The police said the suspect, Aisha Muhammed, a resident of Wuro Patuji village in Mubi South Local Government Area, committed the crime on Thursday. The child has reportedly been under the care of the suspect after the baby’s mother was divorced by her father. “Investigation revealed that the suspect, who is the second wife to the victim’s father, committed the offence by using a hot iron on the girls’ privates, tortured and inflicted injury on the baby,” the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Ngutoje, said in a statement. He added, “The wicked stepmother was arrested by the Police in Mubi South local government area following a report received from Aisha Abdullahi, the mother of the victim and Barrister Khadija Nasir, a female lawyer.” He said the Commissioner of Police, CP Aliyu Adamu, commended FIDA and the officers for the role they played in bringing the matter to the public. He added that the police commissioner has directed discreet investigations and subsequent prosecution as the victim continues receiving medical attention.
