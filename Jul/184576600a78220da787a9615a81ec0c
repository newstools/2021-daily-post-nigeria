Rev. Dr. Samson Olasupo Adeniyi Ayokunle, the President, Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has said that the emergence of Hope Uzodinma as Imo State Governor could only be possible by God’s making. Ayokunle described Uzodinma as a miracle governor, adding that any step taken against him will be subdued. The CAN President stated this while delivering his homily at the Imo prayer summit for peace, held at Heroes Square in Owerri on Friday. Ayokunle said it was for these reasons among others that any plot against the Uzodinma’s administration would be subdued. He said: “Storm came and storm will go. The part way to lasting peace, when a situation like this arises, always prepare to step up to the high ground under the guidance of God. “Let me tell you this, before you take any step or action hear the voice of God, and you don’t reject the voice of God. I say this because you are a miracle governor. You’re coming as governor, as a result of God’s decision. So, you are a miracle governor. That is why any step taken against you will be subdued because your coming as governor can only be possible by God. “For you to continue to stand you have to stand strong. Calling on God always is a part way to victory. Everybody must eschew violence. Everybody in Imo State should join hands together to say no to violence.” Responding, Uzodinma said: “My heart is full of joy for making the day’s event possible. The events of the last few months have characterised Imo State to violence almost making the state become a theater of war, we cried to Almighty God and he answered us. “So when CAN approached me for this I bought it into it whole and tight I have come to be governor of Imo State because I asked God to make me governor and I pledged to God that if he makes me governor I will move Imo state to the next level and God has made me Governor and it is left for me to do my part.”
