The bandits who abducted the students of Bethel Baptist High School, Kaduna, on Monday, July 5, 2021, have called to inform the school management that the students are all doing well and fine. The President, Kaduna Baptist Conference and proprietor of Bethel Baptist High school, Kaduna, Rev. Yahaya Adamu Jangado, in a statement said, “Today, by the grace of God, we had a call from the bandits and they assured us that our children are well and doing okay. In fact, we had the privilege of speaking with a few of them.” He added, “They (students) counted themselves in the jungle and they gave us information that they are 121 and when we put the number together with what we have recovered, we discovered that the number is exactly the same with the number of students we have in the hostel.” Bethel Baptist School: El-rufai condoles families of fallen heroes Rev. Yahaya Jangado explained that the total number of students we recovered in the school on Monday is 28 students that were not abducted. He commended the security officials for acting promptly to the school after receiving a distress call that bandits invaded the school but regretted that in the exchange of fire between the soldiers and the bandits, in the process they lost two of the men. He thanked the parents for their patience, understanding and calmness and solicited their support in this trying moment, assuring them that the management will do anything possible to bring back their children.

For now, we do not know what the bandits will say. They may call for ransom and we may have to negotiate and we have also agreed with the parents to work together in prayers and look up to God in this matter.”
