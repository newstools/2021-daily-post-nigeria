A Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State, Mr Ike Oligbo has called on the leadership of the party to condemn the non-inclusion of electronic transmission of votes in the recent electoral reform bill. Oligbo said failure to include electronic transmission of results during elections in the bill will give the All Progressives Congress (APC) the opportunity to continue to rule the country until it is turned into a one-party state. Speaking at a press conference in Awka, Oligbo said it is in the interest of the party to speak up now, adding it was the plan of the APC dominated National Assembly to exclude the electronic transmission of votes in the just concluded electoral reform bill. He said: “It is scandalous that the opposition parties are not doing more to stop this criminal disenfranchisement of millions of Nigerians by the national assembly refusing to adopt electronic transmission of results which could have stopped any form of rigging, manipulating and changing the election result figures during vote counting and collation, as election rigging has been one of the biggest problems of democracy in Nigeria. “This is a great opportunity to move Nigeria forward from selfish politics to people-oriented politics. If election manipulation and rigging is allowed to continue then Nigeria as a country is doomed as it slides down into a dangerous one party failed state “I hope PDP and other opposition parties will step up and speak out against this attempt by the Government to continue imposing themselves against the will of suffering Nigerians through election manipulation.” Oligbo, a former governorship aspirant said he would not fail to seek legal remedy but obtain a court injunction to stop the Senate from passing the bill. He said voting and election results must be credible and protected to give Nigerians hope and a sense of belonging in choosing their leaders.
