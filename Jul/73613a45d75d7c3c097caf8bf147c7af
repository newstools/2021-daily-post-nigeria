BBNaija star, Tolanibaj, and Instagram comedian, Nasty Blaq, have sparked a relationship rumor following an Insta Story post he shared. The comedian, during a question and answer session with his followers, was asked if he was in a relationship with anyone. In his response, Nasty Black took to his Insta Story to disclose that he “cares about someone” and also attached a video of him opening a car door for the reality show star who was wearing a face mask. He went on to unveil Tolanibaj’s face when a curious fan asked him to. Recall that during the reunion show, Tolanibaj during a confrontation with Vee repeatedly said she is in a “healthy relationship” after her romance with co-reality show star, Prince Enwerem went sour.
