The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has accused the Department of State Services, DSS, of plotting to inject its leader, Nnamdi Kanu with a poisonous vaccine. IPOB’s Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, alleged that the poisonous vaccine was meant to kill Kanu slowly. In a statement he signed, Powerful warned that such an attempt should be jettisoned because the consequences would be severe. IPOB also said the Ohanaeze Ndigbo must ensure that nothing happens to its leader while in DSS custody. According to Powerful: “We pity them and Nigeria if anything happens to our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. The Nigeria Government and security agencies must understand the product we are made of and how prepared we are. “South East Governors and Ohaneze including politicians in the region must ensure that nothing bad happens to Nnamdi Kanu because Miyetti Allah and sympathisers of terrorists are going free in the country but the ordinary person and innocent citizens are molestinged every day because they are Biafrans. We won’t accept that. “We also want to tell the DSS to jettison any plans to inject our leader with a poisonous vaccine that will make him die slowly. Any such attempt will come with unimaginable consequences! Nnamdi Kanu must not die in custody! ”
