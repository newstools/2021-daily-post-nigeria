Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has denied speculations that he will decamp from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to All Progressives Congress (APC). The Governor says he remains a PDP man and has no plan to leave for any other party. Fintiri reacted Thursday through his Director of Media and Communications, Mr Solomon Kumangar, to a speculation which arose from social media remarks by APC loyalists insinuating that Fintiri would soon be decamping to the APC. Solomon Kumangar stressed in a statement that the Governor is not contemplating leaving the PDP, but that he is comfortably leading the party in Adamawa State to achieve development milestones for the people. Primate Ayodele exposes three PDP govs allegedly planning to decamp to APC “He remains focused on the mandate of providing good governance to all parts of the state,” the statement said. It was insinuated that Governor Ahmadu Fintiri had gone to Abuja to lobby for membership of the APC, but the statement from Government House in Yola which said it was not in the government’s culture to join issues with the opposition “social media warriors”, added nevertheless that it found it necessary to set the record straight. Discounting seeming emphasis on political affiliation, the statement said, “What is most important at this point is for Nigerians of all walks of life to join hands and surmount the challenges confronting the nation.”
