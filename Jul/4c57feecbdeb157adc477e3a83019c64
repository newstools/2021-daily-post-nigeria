Loyalists and supporters of Sunday Adeyemo also known as Sunday Igboho on Wednesday issued a 7-day ultimatum to the federal government to release those arrested at the residence of the Yoruba activist. DAILY POST recalls that family members of Igboho’s arrested loyalists on Wednesday thronged major streets in Ibadan in demand for their release. The DSS had confirmed the arrest of thirteen persons during a press conference on Thursday last week. The family members of loyalists and supporters of Igboho have now issued a 7-day ultimatum to the federal government and the DSS to immediately release the arrested persons. They made this disclosure when they took the protest to the palace of the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji. The protesters who were dressed in black called for the unconditional release of the affected individuals within seven days. The protesters while addressing the monarch also demanded the sum of five hundred million naira as compensation for Igboho’s ordeal from the federal government and the DSS. But the monarch while addressing the protesters advised them to stop spreading rumours on social media accusing traditional rulers of collecting money from the FG. Oba Adetunji who spoke through his Media Aide, Adeola Oloko, noted that the demands of the protesters have been noted. He added that the monarch will forward their demands to the FG.
