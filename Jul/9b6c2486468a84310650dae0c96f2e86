Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, former Minister of Finance, has said that she has been vindicated by a Federal High Court in Abuja. Adeosun also said that the judgement of Justice Taiwo Taiwo wasn’t only a personal win for her but for every Nigerian in the Diaspora. DAILY POST had earlier reported on Wednesday that the Federal High Court in Abuja said that Adeosun did not need the National Youth Service Scheme (NYSC) discharge certificate to take up any ministerial appointment or before standing for any elective office in the country. Reacting to the judgment, Adeosun, in a statement in Abuja, said that she had a traumatic spell on the NYSC certificate forgery allegation against her. The statement reads in part: “My lawyers have informed me of the judgment by the Federal High Court, Abuja, in the case of Folakemi Adeosun v The Attorney General of the Federation (FHC/ABJ/CS/303/2021), in which the court, presided over by Honourable Justice Taiwo Taiwo, ruled that the Constitution does not require me to present my first-degree certificate or any other certificate, including the NYSC certificate, to be appointed a Minister. “The ruling vindicates me after a very traumatic spell. It’s, however, not only a personal victory; it is also a victory for many Nigerians in the Diaspora under similar conditions which are desirous of serving their country. Adeosun’s certificate forgery worse than Pantami’s comments on terrorists – Garba Shehu “I wish to thank God, my family, friends, my counsel, Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN) and numerous well-wishers for their love, care and concern throughout this difficult period, which has lasted three whole years.”
