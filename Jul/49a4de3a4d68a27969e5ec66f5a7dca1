The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt Gen Faruk Yahaya has commiserated with troops involved in a road accident on Thursday at Garin Kuturu, along Maiduguri-Damaturu road. DAILY POST had reported that a detachment of Nigerian soldiers fighting Boko Haram was on Thursday involved in an accident on their way to rescue travelers attacked by Boko Haram. A statement issued by the Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General, Onyema Nwachukwu on Friday confirmed that one of the gun trucks conveying the troops skidded off the road and rammed into a road shoulder. The incident caused the vehicle to somersault. Nwachukwu further stated that nine personnel who sustained varying degrees of injuries are currently receiving treatment in a military medical facility and no fatality was recorded. He, therefore, commended the troops for their swift response and urged them to be more circumspect during emergency operational responses. Nigerian Army will win all battles, we’re loyal to Buhari – Gen Yahaya
