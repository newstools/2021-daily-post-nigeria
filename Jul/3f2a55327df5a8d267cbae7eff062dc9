The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) says certain interests, including legislators, are plotting a rejection of electronic transmission of results. The matter will be debated in both chambers of the National Assembly. A statement by PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, appealed to the representatives to shun partisanship. The party advised them to vote in national interest on section 50 (2) of the Electoral Act amendment bill. The PDP said it behooves on every Nigerian, particularly the lawmakers, to work on the improvement of our electoral processes. Ologbondiyan said now is the time to engender free, fair, transparent and credible elections. The party insists there is no part of Nigeria or local government where the communication network does not function. PDP said the excuse being put forward by those against e-transfer of results must be discarded. “It is imperative to add that with the technology proposed by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), even where the network is slow, it does not stop the transmission process”, he added.
