The Federal Government has warned against misleading theories crafted by anti-vaccination elements to discourage Nigerians from seeking protection against COVID-19. It also emphasised the presence of the newly discovered Delta variant of the virus in Nigeria, warning residents to protect themselves. Advising Nigerians to remain alert over the increasing cases of the infection, the Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr Faisal Shuaib said it was expedient for Nigerians to continue observing non-pharmaceutical public health measures against COVID. “With the detection of the Delta Variant of COVID-19 in Nigeria, it is important that Nigerians continue to observe non-pharmaceutical or public health measures such as wearing of facemask, social distancing and hand hygiene in order to curb the transmission of the disease,” Shuaib said. ‘‘Although it is increasingly evident from independent voices that the conspiracy theories are fake and misleading, we need to remain on alert and continue to provide Nigerians with factual information to enable them see the need to get vaccinated against COVID-19’’.
