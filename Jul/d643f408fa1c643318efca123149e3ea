A Kano State High Court on Wednesday sentenced a security guard, Ibrahim Sale to six years imprisonment. Sale was found guilty of assaulting an 8-year-old girl. The resident of Darmanawa Quarters, Kano, was arraigned on a three-count charge of criminal conspiracy, rape and act of gross indecency. Justice Usman Na’abba, however, held that the prosecution did not prove their case of rape beyond reasonable doubt. “There was no evidence of penetration tendered before the court,” he said. Na’abba sentenced Sale to six years imprisonment starting from the first day of arrest. Prosecution counsel, Hafsat Kabir-Sanusi, had told the court that the convict committed the offence on July 24, 2017. The lawyer said on the same date at about 4:00 p.m, Sale conspired with Sa’adu Ibrahim, a driver, who had sexual intercourse with the minor many times. Ibrahim, the first defendant and driver of the victim, raped the girl on different occasions whenever he brought her back from school. The prosecutor recalled that Ibrahim was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, Hepatitis, and died in prison in December 2019 while awaiting trial. 25-year-old final student of Unilorin bags three year jail for N35m internet fraud
