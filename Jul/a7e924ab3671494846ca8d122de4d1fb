Two buildings, one under construction and another abandoned in Amikwo village, Awka, the state capital, and in Oko, Aguata Local Government Area of the state have collapsed. Sources said both collapsed buildings were 2-storey structures. Four persons were said to have been trapped inside the debris in the Oko building but were rescued with injuries, while about 20 persons reportedly escaped death in that of Amikwo. One of the witnesses whose name was not revealed said the Amikwo building collapsed at about 2am on Wednesday, falling on a part of an occupied two-storey building nearby, however, no lives were lost. When contacted on the Oko incident, the Executive Chairman of Anambra Physical Planning Board, Barrister Chike Maduekwe, blamed the incident on compromised structural integrity. He said the structure had since been sealed, while developers had been invited for questioning. When our correspondent visited the scene of the Awka incident, the building had also been sealed by officials of the Awka Capital Territory Development Authority (ACTDA). The Managing Director, ACTDA, Ven Amaechi Okwuosa said the building has been under construction for the past ten years and was marked for demolition in 2018. “Although the developer had commenced demolition of the building, the right equipment was not used, hence the collapse,” he said.
