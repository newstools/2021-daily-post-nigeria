Femi Falana, a human rights lawyer, has insisted that Nigeria will be in trouble if the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, is barred from transmitting election results electronically ahead of the 2023 general election. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria spoke during an interview on Channels Television’s Politics Today. Recall that the National Assembly leadership had two weeks ago blocked the electronic transmission of election results in Nigeria. Falana said, “By virtue of Section 52 of the Electoral Act amended in 2015, INEC is given unchallenged powers to devise any process to guarantee that everybody is able to vote and so INEC is empowered to transmit results electronically. “When you now put it in the law that INEC shall not transmit election results electronically, we are in trouble. “I am sure that Nigerians are going to continue to demand that proper things be done in order to ensure that the process we are putting in place will guarantee fair and free elections.” Falana’s statement is coming less than a week after former INEC Chairman, Prof Attahiru Jega, faulted the exclusion of electronic transfer of results. “You can’t permit INEC on one hand to use electronic voting and not use electronic transmission of results because usually, they go as a package,” Jega had said.
