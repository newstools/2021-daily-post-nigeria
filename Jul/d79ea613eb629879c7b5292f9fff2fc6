The Arewa Youth Forum (AYF), has advised the Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, to tread the part of diplomacy by building bridges across the country instead of sticking to political entitlement as it concerns the 2023 presidency. Comrade Gambo Ibrahim Gujungu, National President of AYF, while briefing newsmen in Kaduna, Monday, explained that democracy and the political system did not recognize self entitlement, but consultation, campaign and the spirit of give and take. Reacting to the statement credited to the Ohanaeze Ndigbo that the Kogi State Governor Alhaji Yahaya Bello was still in school when the issue of zoning and rotational presidency was discussed and agreed upon, Gujungu observed that it is better if the South East go for negotiation instead of feeling that they are entitled to the Presidency just like that. 2023: Restore peace before talking about presidency – Northern groups to Southern governors According to Gujungu, democracy is a game of number, where the minority have their say and the majority have their way, adding that it concerns the 2023 Presidency as Nigerians all the zones are entitled to lead the country but will not be done by threat or casting aspersions at another person that is showing interest in leading the country. According to him, “I don’t think that this approach by the Igbo socio-cultural group will succeed if they really want the Presidency. Also Nigerians have not been told whether Ohanaeze Ndigbo is working for the Peoples Democratic Party that had rotation in its constitution or the All Progressives Congress that did not have that in their constitution or any other party.” The National President tasked Ohanaeze Ndigbo to first put its house in order by discussing with the people of the south East if they want secession or the Presidency, saying that Nigerians are confused and still wondering what the South East really want. The leader of Northern youths with members from the 19 Northern states and Abuja advised Igbo leaders to first put their house in order, stop the uprising and discordant tune in the region, and approach Nigerians with a common front if actually they are serious about the Presidency in 2023. He also urged Nigerians not to sacrifice competence, energy to serve the country and knowledge of contemporary international politics in the twenty-first century on the altar of zoning.
