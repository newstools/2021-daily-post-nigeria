Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, has been summoned by the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Minister, according to multiple reports, was summoned over a parallel state secretariat he opened in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital. The Information Minister is expected to explain why disciplinary measures should not be taken against him for the action. While the party’s headquarters is located in the Tanke area of Ilorin, Lai Mohammed’s faction unveiled its secretariat at GRA. The summon, according to PM News, came after Samari Abubakar, the State’s Caretaker Committee Chairman, threatened to invoke party rules against him. Abubakar had on Tuesday told journalists in Abuja that Lai Mohammed may be sanctioned in line with the party’s constitution. Insecurity: APC passes vote of confidence on Buhari
