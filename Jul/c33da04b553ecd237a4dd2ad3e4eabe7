Napoli forward, Hirving Lozano, was taken to hospital to have further scans on his head and neck following a horror injury in Mexico’s Gold Cup 0-0 draw against Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday. Lozano needed to be stretchered off after just 11 minutes of the encounter, falling into the knee of Trinidad goalkeeper Marvin Philips. The collision left the 25-year-old motionless, and a neck brace was fitted to his neck before he was stretchered off the pitch.  From the stadium, the Mexican international was transferred directly to hospital in Dallas, with the team later releasing a statement saying: “Hirving Lozano is stable, conscious and he will be medically examined.” Lozano has been in spectacular form for Mexico and Napoli this season. He scored eleven goals in 32 appearances for Napoli.
