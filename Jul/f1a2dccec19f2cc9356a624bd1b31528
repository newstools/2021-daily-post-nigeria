The shutdown of the University of Lagos due to the outbreak of suspected cases of COVID-19 is creating more confusion for students and parents. The school had issued a circular that all students should vacate the halls of residence latest by 12.00 noon on Thursday 15 July. The statement was issued by Principal Assistant Registrar, Corporate Affairs, Mrs Nonye Oguama. However, information circulating on some of the students’ WhatsApp forums is creating confusion. The message cited by DAILY POST purportedly emanated from the office of the Dean, Students Affairs. The message claimed that the students are to resume on Monday, noting that the school will be fumigated during the weekend. Although the message did not contain any signature or have any semblance of an official communication, it is spreading on some of the Whatsapp platforms in the school. A student of the school, who preferred not to be mentioned, said “some people have already gotten to Ibadan. And the management is not doing anything to issue a circular to debunk the latest information in circulation.” The Dean of Students’ Affairs, Prof Ademola Adeleke, did not pick his calls to speak on the confusion ongoing in his school. It would be recalled that the school recently discovered cases of COVID-19, when a student who had complained of malaria was discovered to have had COVID-19. Subsequently, contact tracing confirmed that her roommates also have the virus. The Senate had met on Wednesday and resolved to shut down the halls and set July 26 for resumption of lectures online. As it stands, the information in circulation is creating confusion among the students.
