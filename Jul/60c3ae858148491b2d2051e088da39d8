The 20-year-old is heavily linked with a move to Chelsea. Zorc has remained adamant that Haaland is not for sale, but on Monday, when Sky Sports Germany asked where the Norway striker was, Zorc smiled and joked: “He’s already in England!” Haaland has scored 57 goals in 59 games since joining Dortmund and is understood to be valued at over close to £150m The striker has three years left on his contract but he has a £66million release clause which becomes active in 2022.
