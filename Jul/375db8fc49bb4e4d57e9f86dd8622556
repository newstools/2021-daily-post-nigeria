Microsoft Founder, Bill Gates has blamed himself for “messing up” as he opens up about his messy divorce. DAILY POST reported that Bill and Melinda announced on Monday that they will be getting a divorce in a joint statement after 27 years of marriage. The Microsoft founder said after a great deal of thought and a lot of work, “we have made the decision to end our marriage”. He noted that they raised three incredible children and built a foundation that works all over the world to enable all people to lead healthy, productive lives. “We continue to share a belief in that mission and will continue to work together at the foundation, but we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives,” he said. However,during an interview with CNBC host, Becky Quick, at a summer camp for billionaires, Gates said he messed up, adding that the divorce was his fault. ”It hasn’t been an easy one but the decision was in our best interest. At some point I think I messed up and I feel we are here because of me,” he said. The “summer camp for billionaires” was attended by some of the most powerful people in sports, technology, and media.
