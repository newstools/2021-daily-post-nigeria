Former BBNaija season four housemate, Alex Asogwa, aka, Alex Unusual has revealed that no amount of peer pressure will make her want to date a married man. The reality Tv star made this known during a question and answer section with her followers via her Instagram account on Friday. Alex was asked to state something that no amount of peer pressure would make her do. In her response, she said that she would never date a married man no matter what the circumstances may be. She also revealed that no amount of peer pressure would make her go for a butt or breast enhancement which seems to be the trend for most Nigerian girls. “No amount of peer pressure will make me want to go for surgery, do drugs, smoke, or even date a married man,” she wrote.
