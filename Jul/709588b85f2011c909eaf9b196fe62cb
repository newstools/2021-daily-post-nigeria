Jose Mourinho has insisted his time as manager of Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur was a “disaster”. The 58-year-old stated this as he was presented as Roma’s new manager on Thursday. Mourinho was fired by United in December 2018, before taking up the job at Spurs in November 2019, where he was sacked in April 2021. The Portuguese was announced as Roma’s new manager in May. While at United, Mourinho won the Community Shield, EFL Cup and Europa League. He led Spurs to the EFL Cup final, but he was axed before the game, with Tottenham going on to lose 1-0 to Manchester City. “I won three trophies at Manchester United and that was seen as a disaster,” Mourinho said. “I reached a cup final which I was not allowed to play at Tottenham, and that was seen as a disaster. “What’s a disaster for me is considered a great success for others.”
