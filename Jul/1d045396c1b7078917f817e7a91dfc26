Juventus CEO, Federico Cherubini, has said the club has been given “no signal from Cristiano Ronaldo” that he wants to leave. Ronaldo is entering the last year of his current deal with the Serie A giants and will be 37 by the time it ends. He has been linked with Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and teams in MLS. “There has been no signal from Ronaldo. “Especially the rumours that there should be a transfer and there’s no sign from Juventus in this regard. “Last season he scored 36 goals in 44 games, the numbers don’t always say everything but hide many truths, we are happy that Ronaldo will join the team as soon as he has finished his holidays,” Cherubini told reporters when quizzed on the speculation surrounding Ronaldo, who is now the quickest to 100 goals for Juventus. When pressed on whether he expects the five-time Ballon d’or winner to return for 2021/2022, Cherubini added: “I don’t have the crystal ball, but right now there are no signals regarding a possible transfer.” EPL: Tuchel reveals ‘huge weapon’ available to Chelsea for Crystal Palace clash
