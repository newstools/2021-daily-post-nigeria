Roma manager, Jose Mourinho, has told England boss Gareth Southgate to start Jack Grealish in their Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark on Wednesday night. The Aston Villa midfielder is a huge favourite among English fans this summer. This had led to widespread calls for Grealish to be given more playing time by Southgate. The 25-year-old has mostly been named as a substitute at the tournament. Grealish didn’t come off the bench in the 4-0 victory over Ukraine in the quarter-finals and looks likely to start on the bench again against the Danes. “Everybody knows I am very, very Grealish. I like the guy because he never hides, he creates unbalanced situations for defenders, he’s brave. “When a team is so solid like England, especially with Rice and Phillips in front of the back-four, I believe a team always needs a player like Grealish. “It doesn’t look like he’s an option to start with Gareth, and Gareth is right, especially if England win the Euros – Gareth is right and we are wrong. I would play Grealish but it doesn’t look like he will start,” Mourinho told talkSPORT Breakfast. EPL: Guardiola ready to complete deals for Harry Kane, Grealish
