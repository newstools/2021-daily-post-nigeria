England legend Wayne Rooney has warned the Three Lions to avoid allowing Italy to dictate the tempo of Sunday’s Euro 2020 final. According to Rooney, England must do this if they are to emerge victorious and end 55 years of hurt at Wembley. Italy boss, Roberto Mancini, will rely on the experience of Leonardo Bonucci and Giorginio Chiellini in defence in a bid to nullify the likes of Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling. Italy also have a midfield laden with technical ability and boundless energy controlled by Chelsea star, Jorginho. “I think we’re favourites,” ex-skipper Rooney told The Times. “Quality wise, England have enough and mentally you can see the players are in a good place. “My one warning would be that we can’t get caught up in how Italy play, the way they’ll try and slow the game down. “If I were Gareth I’d be telling England’s players to get the ball down and play quick, keep the tempo high, keep the Italians working, and tire them out. “Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini are great players — but not the quickest. I’m sure Gareth and Steve Holland will be looking at Alvaro Morata’s goal for Spain in Italy’s semi-final. “If England can get Raheem making his inside runs, and Harry and other quick players moving down their sides, Chiellini and Bonucci won’t enjoy it one bit.”
