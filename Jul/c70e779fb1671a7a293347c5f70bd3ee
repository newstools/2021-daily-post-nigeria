Armed bandits in a raid last night (Saturday) abducted the Emir of Kajuru and 13 members of his family. A cabinet member of the Emir confirmed the incident to DAILY POST. Recall that bandits have in the recent time, in Kaduna and its environs, intensified their illicit activities by killing and kidnapping innocent people for ransom in the State. The 2nd class Emir, about 85 years old was kidnapped with three women, two of his grand children, three of his aides and five others to an unknown destination. According to the source, “Just a day before the incident, the Emir summoned a security meeting about a potential ploy to kidnap him but, unfortunately, the security agents didn’t act on it.” The Kajuru Emirate is about 40 minutes drive to Kaduna town.
