It’s only Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu they know how to flex their muscles on.” @Mceentia “It is still in the north and no one is saying anything about it.If it is another state now they’ll deploy air force and army.” @DedonEndSars “ DSS, Police and Army this is your job and not on innocent protesters.” @Rizamanathan “ May God help us. They won’t rescue these set of victims and display for praises, It’s Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday own they sabi.Naija na cruise.” @Collins65 “ It is a welcome development.
