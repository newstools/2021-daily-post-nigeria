Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has accused the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government of double-standard in the case of Yoruba freedom fighter, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Igboho. Omokri wondered why the government made an attempt to arrest Igboho for obeying a self-defense directive by the Minister of Defence, Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi (rtd). Magashi had in February said Nigerians should not be cowards but should defend themselves against bandits and killer herdsmen. The minister had noted that bandits sometimes carried out their operations with a few rounds of ammunition to cause fear, hence Nigerians should jettison fear and defend themselves. Magashi had said: “It is the responsibility of everybody to keep alert and to find safety when necessary. But we shouldn’t be cowards. “I don’t know why people are running from minor things like that. They should stand and let these people know that even the villagers have the competency and capabilities to defend themselves.” Omokri, in a tweet wrote: “What I do not understand about this Sunday Igboho case is this: Buhari’s Defence Minister, told us to defend ourselves from bandits and killer herdsmen. “Sunday Igboho has done exactly that. Now they want to arrest Igboho for obeying their own directive to Nigerians?” Operatives of the Department of State Services, DSS, had invaded Igboho’s residence in Ibadan a few days ago. Though the Yoruba freedom fighter was not arrested, some of his allies were killed and apprehended. DSS also alleged to have recovered weapons and charms from Igboho’s residence during the raid. Igboho, however, denied ownership of the weapons paraded by DSS, stressing that he protects himself with traditional powers.
