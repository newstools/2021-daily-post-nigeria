Scammers are again using the name of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar to fleece unsuspecting Nigerians. The Wazirin Adamawa’s spokesman, Paul Ibe, raised the alarm on Monday. He said a fake online portal, the Atiku Foundation Youth Empowerment Fund has been set up by unscrupulous elements. Ibe noted that the objective of the criminals is to defraud members of the public by advertising the identity of the ex-VP as being associated with them. “The portal is fake and certainly does not enjoy the authorisation of Atiku. Indeed, this scam was first introduced in 2019 by criminal elements.” Ibe appealed to the Atiku’s supporters of Adamawa not to patronise any scheme in his name. The statement urged law enforcement agencies to track and arrest and prosecute the individuals behind the identity forgery.
