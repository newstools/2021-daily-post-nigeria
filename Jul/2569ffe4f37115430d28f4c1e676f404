The Peoples Democratic Party has named Senator Ibrahim Dambaba (Sokoto South) as the new Senate Minority Whip. Recall that Danbaba left the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 8th Senate alongside Gov. Aminu Tambuwal, to join the PDP, where he contested for the senatorial seat. He was later sworn-in as Senator representing Sokoto South Senatorial district. He replaces Senator Sahabi Yau from Zamfara State, who defected to the APC recently. Details later..
