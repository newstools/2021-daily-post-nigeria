President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to the death of the Emir of Lafiagi, Alhaji Sa’adu Kawu Haliru. The 86-year-old First-class monarch died on Thursday and Buhari, in a condolence message signed by Garba Shehu, his Spokesman, commiserated with the Government and people of Kwara State. The President also sympathized with the Council of Traditional Rulers, who will sorely miss the wisdom and guidance of the royal father. He also condoled with the late monarch’s family members. Haliru was the Emir of Lafiagi for 46 years, and Buhari noted that while on the throne, he initiated and sustained peaceful co-existence in the domain, especially in accommodating other ethnic groups and nationalities. Buhari, according to the statement, believes the monarch’s legacy of hospitality, harmonious living, and encouraging civic responsibility should be sustained. He prayed that the Almighty God will accept the soul of the departed and comfort his family. Saadu Haliru: Emir of Lafiagi passes on, Gov Abdulrazaq mourns
