Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has advised England manager, Gareth Southgate, to start Bukayo Saka against Denmark in their Euro 2020 semi-final on Wednesday night. Saka missed out on the 4-0 win over Ukraine in the last round, after picking up a knock in training. However, the Arsenal youngster is available for selection again.

But between Saka, Grealish, Foden, Sancho, Rashford, I honestly think you could flip a coin between them all and it could land on any of them and you wouldn’t be disappointed. We have such strength in those positions. “We are so blessed, that actually I pick one – Bukayo Saka to come back in for Sancho – but it’s not because I favour one over the other. I just thought Saka brought such energy to the game against Germany at Wembley and such energy to the game against Czech Republic that I feel he comes back in. “The Danish team won’t enjoy playing against him – that’s not to say they’d enjoy playing against Sancho or any other – I just think Saka had such an incredible influence on that crowd at Wembley.

“But it may not even be a four-man defence system – Gareth may match Denmark up. He did that against the German team, and I do think that because of the experience against Scotland, where England struggled against the wing-backs, that he may match them again,” Neville told Sky Sports.
