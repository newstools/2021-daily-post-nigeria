Local Government Chairmen of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State have said former governor Ayo Fayose is not bothered by petty blackmail. The party made the comment in reaction to the alleged threat by Fayose to join the All Progressives Congress (APC) if his preferred candidate is not picked as the governorship flagbearer. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) fixed June 18, 2022 for the gubernatorial election. In May, Fayose publicly declared support for the ambition of Bisi Kolawole, PDP chairman in Ekiti. Kolawole is a native of Efon Alaaye in Ekiti Central. He was formerly House of Assembly member (2007 to 2011) and Commissioner for Environment under Fayose (2014 to 2018) Michael Abiodun, Chairman of PDP LG Chairmen in a statement said it is PDP or nothing for Fayose and his political family. The party chieftain declared that the former governor cannot “abandon” his house for “tenants”. “For supporting Bisi Kolawole as PDP governorship candidate, he has no apologies. This is more so that opponents of Bisi Kolawole also know that he is the aspirant to beat. “For Fayose, PDP remains the bigger picture that must be protected. Our leader is used to these armchair politics of image smearing, he has never been bothered”, he said.
