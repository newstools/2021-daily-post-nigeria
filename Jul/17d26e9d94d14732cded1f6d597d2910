An Egba Chief, Toyin Amuzu has lamented the sudden rise in untimely deaths among Nigerians, especially youths in their prime. Amuzu expressed worry that Nigeria is fast losing brilliant and promising citizens of all ages to the cold hand of death. The Leragun of Igbein Abeokuta said most of the deaths were avoidable if Nigerians had made it a habit to regularly examine themselves medically. According to him, most diseases killing Nigerians could have been treated or managed if detected early before complications. Toyin Amuzu encouraged the people to always ensure regular medical check-up to confirm their health status to reduce the incidence of sudden death in the country. He, however, blamed poverty for people’s failure to check their health status, saying many are still struggling to put food on their tables. DAILY POST reports that Amuzu spoke on Saturday during a free Community medical service, organised by the Toyin Amuzu Support Group, as part of its activities to enhance healthy living, for residents of Abeokuta South Local Government Area of Ogun State. The free medical service held at Ijaye, had professionals who conducted checks on beneficiaries to assess their sugar level, blood pressure, and other ailments. Some of those attended to were given needed medications, while those with major complications were referred to the hospital. “The level of death arising from failure to conduct medical check-up has risen due to lack of finances, thus the need to support the people. “The normal thing is to regularly check-up one’s body to know the health status of our body, but these days, many are struggling to eat three square meals and do not have money to take proper care of their health. So, it has become necessary to be our brother’s keeper. “We all have to rise to create a better society for ourselves and nip in the bud the many deaths and violence arising from lack of care and love for our fellow humans,” he said.
