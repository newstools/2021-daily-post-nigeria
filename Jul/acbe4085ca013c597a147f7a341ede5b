Denmark manager, Kasper Hjulmand, has criticized the penalty decision that saw his team eliminated by England from Euro 2020. The Three Lions won 2-1 in extra time, after the game ended 1-1 after 90 minutes. Mikkel Damsgaard opened scoring with a terrific free-kick, before England equalized thanks to an own goal from Simon Kjaer. The decisive moment of the game came in extra time, after Gareth Southgate’s men were awarded a penalty. Harry Kane’s spot-kick was saved by Kasper Schmeichel, but the Tottenham striker scored from the rebound. “We’re very, very disappointed, and it’s hard for me to talk about. “Maybe it will [be] easier for me to say how I feel in a few days,” Hjulmand said after Wednesday’s loss at Wembley. Raheem Sterling won the penalty, when he fell under the challenge of Mathias Jensen. The contact looked minimal, and a VAR review was needed, after which the decision stood. “We’re disappointed it was decided that way. … It was a penalty that shouldn’t have been a penalty, and that annoys me right now. We’re disappointed, we’re very disappointed. “It’s one thing to lose a game, that happens, but losing this way is just a disappointment, because these guys have fought a lot,” Hjulmand added.
