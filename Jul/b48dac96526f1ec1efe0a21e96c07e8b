Nigerian human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, has described President Muhammadu Buhari as a tyrant that must be defeated. Sowore made the remark while throwing his weight behind tomorrow’s planned Oduduwa rally in Lagos State. He urged the organisers of Oduduwa rally to defy the threats by the Nigeria Police Force and go ahead. In a tweet, the activist maintained that protest was not a crime. “I totally and unequivocally support the Oduduwa rally scheduled for Lagos tomorrow, I urge organisers and participants to ignore the Nigeria Police Force and massively come out! Protest is NOT a crime. Tyrant @MBuhari must be defeated. #BuhariMustGo#Revolutionnow.” Tension is high in some parts of the state over the attack on the Ibadan home of Igboho by Nigerian forces as well as the planned Yoruba Nation rally on Saturday. Secessionist organizations have vowed to go ahead with the gathering despite the ban announced by the Police.
