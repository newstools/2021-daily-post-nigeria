Shehu Sani, a former federal lawmaker, has told President Muhammadu Buhari’s aide, Lauretta Onochie to perish the hope of becoming a commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. Sani also described her denial of being a member of the All Progressives Congress, APC, as baseless, adding that her presence in INEC will make Nigerians doubt its credibility. The Delta-born politician appeared before the Senator Kabir Gaya-led Committee on INEC on Thursday for screening after being nominated by President Buhari. Onochie, who has a plethora of petitions against her nomination, told the panel that she had experience from her former place of work in the United Kingdom where she learnt to be liberal and non-partisan. Stop the denial, you are a member of APC – PDP tells Onochie The panel raised concerns and wondered how she would dust herself of being partisan given that she is actively involved in partisan politics. However, Onochie told the panel that she was invited from the UK in 2014 to join the APC and work for Buhari, adding that since the second election in 2019, she had resigned membership of the ruling party and had also quit active politics. But Sani, who represented Kaduna central senatorial district in the 8th Assembly, described this as baseless, saying, “Lauretta is outrightly undeserving of being a commissioner in @inecnigeria. “Her presence in the electoral body will undoubtedly question its credibility and independence.” “Her denial before the screening committee is baseless. She is a partisan agent of the ruling party. Period,” he tweeted. Senate told not to confirm Lauretta Onochie as INEC commissioner
