Chelsea are ready to offer Borussia Dortmund up to Â£150 million for Erling Haaland, according to 90min. New Blues boss, Thomas Tuchel, is looking to bolster his attack ahead of his first full season in charge. Tuchel had to endure the patchy form of Timo Werner in his first six months, having froze Tammy Abraham out of his team. Haaland has scored 57 goals in 59 games since arriving at Dortmund 18 months ago. However, the Bundesliga side will be very hesitant to part with the Norway striker, especially since Jadon Sancho just left to join Manchester United. But Chelsea feel a high fee will tempt Dortmund into a sale.
