Sergio Ramos appeared to take a dig at his former club, Real Madrid, after his transfer to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) was made official on Thursday. The 35-year-old left Los Blancos after 16 years, following the expiration of his contract. Ramos was linked with top clubs around Europe, but decided on PSG, where he has signed a two-year deal. After the move was confirmed, the Spanish centre back took to social media to share a picture of himself holding a PSG shirt. And he sent a pointed message towards his former employers as he tweeted: “The best place to keep on dreaming, the best club to keep on winning. We’re going to fight with everything we have for everything. Allez PSG.” Ramos left Madrid under controversial circumstances, and he insisted at the time that he did not want to depart but was driven out by president Florentino Perez.
