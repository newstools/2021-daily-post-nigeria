Following the alleged plan by the Ondo State Government to prioritize the payment of 100 percent salary to medical officers in the state, the Nigerian Labour Congress, NLC, has threatened showdown over the move. The state chapter of the NLC made the resolve at its congress where the issue of the workers salary was extensively discussed. According to the union, its members will not hesitate to embark on industrial action if the state proceeded to pay the medical workers 100 percent salary with other civil servants left out in the payment of full salaries. The state government had been paying modulated salaries to civil servants in the state with medical doctors embarking of indefinite strike few months ago over the development. While noting that medical doctors provide essentials services, the union maintained that that should not be the yardstick for superimposing them above other civil servants. “We are not averse to the payment of 100% salary to Medical Officers as long as it will also cut across every civil servant in the State.
“We REJECT in its entirety the idea of preferring Medical Officers only for 100% salary payment and leaving out other Medical and Health workers who are in the same sector including the Security, Drivers, Sanitary Labour and Gardeners.” The union added that its position on the new regime of salary payment was due to the effect of COVID-19 on the global economy.
