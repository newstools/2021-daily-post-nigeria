A former member of the House of Representatives, Karimi Sunday, has claimed it will still be the turn of the North to produce Nigeria’s President in 2023. He stated this on Friday, according to Vanguard. From 2011 to 2019, Karimi represented Yagba Federal Constituency in the National Assembly. “Since 1999, the rotation started from the South and ended in the North. It should start from where it ended, as it is the normal practice for a rotational agreement. “Also between 1999 and 2023, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo from the South-West ruled for eight years and handed over to Alhaji Shehu Musa Yar’adua, who ruled for two years and died. “President Goodluck Jonathan ruled for six years and handed over to President Muhammadu Buhari, who will complete his eight years in 2023.” Karimi added that “Since the South has had a combined 14 years while the North will complete 10 years in 2023, for the sake of equity, the next President should come from another geo-political zone in the North, preferably the North Central.” Recall that on Monday, the 17 governors under the aegis of Southern Governors’ Forum, met in Lagos. They insisted that Nigeria’s next president must come from the South. A communiqué read by the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, afterward, said the forum is committed to politics of fairness and equity. 2023 Presidency: Zoning can’t stop Tinubu – Ex-Minster
