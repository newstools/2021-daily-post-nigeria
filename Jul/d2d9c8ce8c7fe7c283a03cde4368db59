The Police in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have apprehended a man who allegedly planned his “abduction”. Operatives picked the 35-year-old from a location in Abuja he used as hideout. The sting operation was carried out by a Police crack team. A preliminary investigation revealed the suspect conspired with the wife in the scheme. The plan was to portray him as a kidnap victim and get his company to pay a ransom to the purported captors. The man and others nabbed in recent operations by the FCT command will soon be paraded by the Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma.
