Governor Babagana Zulum has reacted to reports that Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP), has appointed a new governor identified as Abba Gana aka Ba-Lawan in the state. Ba-Lawan was reappointed ISWAP leader, barely six months after his removal by the Shura council for loss of confidence. Reacting, Zulum, who spoke to newsmen after a meeting with Buhari on Monday, said that he is fully in charge of the state and ISWAP is not controlling part of the state. The governor said the report was not authentic and he will not investigate it. “We are yet to validate the authenticity of this report that ISWAP appointed a governor in Borno State. So, as the governor of the state, I think it’s not right for me to speak on something that I don’t have full knowledge of.” “As far as I’m concerned, I’m the governor of Borno State and I don’t have any information that we have another government. Yes. And I’m very much in charge.”
