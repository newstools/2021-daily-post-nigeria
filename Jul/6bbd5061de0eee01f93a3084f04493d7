Some members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Obokun, Ola-Oluwa and Iwo local governments have taken their grievances to the premises of the Osun State House of Assembly. Storming the House of Assembly in their hundreds on Monday, the protesters said they came to confront the legislators to register their displeasure over the lists of caretaker committee nominees for their local councils. The protesters accused their leaders of betrayal and switching names of their preferred candidates before the list was approved by the legislators last week. They demanded the Assembly to step down the lists of nominees as presented to them by the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola. While demanding the legislators to revisit the harmonised list submitted by the party leaders in the local governments. The protesters alleged that the list of nominees they prepared in conjunction with party leaders at the local government level had been replaced. In his response the Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly, Timothy Owoeye assured the protesters that the Assembly would look into their demands. He also appealed to the protesters to maintain the peace, be calm and patient as the House was on top of the situation and will look critically into the matter.
