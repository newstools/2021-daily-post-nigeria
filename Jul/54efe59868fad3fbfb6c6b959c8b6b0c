Borussia Dortmund CEO, Hans-Joachim Watzke, has admitted they are “not happy” with Manchester United’s deal to sign Jadon Sancho. The German club on Thursday confirmed an agreement with United for an €85 million (£73.1m) fee. Last summer, the Red Devils failed to sign Sancho as Dortmund stood firm over their €120m (£108m) asking price. This month, United have seen two bids worth €72m (£61.9m) and €78m (£67.1m) rejected by the Bundesliga outfit. But with Sancho making it clear that he is keen on a return to England, Dortmund accepted United’s third offer. “We’re not happy about the money. We’re sad that he’s gone. “At the end of the day, it was Jadon’s exemplary wish to leave, we would have preferred to keep him here. “But he behaved fantastic and gave everything for four years. He made us move forward significantly in the second half of the season,” Watzke admitted during a press conference on Thursday.
