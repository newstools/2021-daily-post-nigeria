Sergio Ramos is in advanced negotiations with Paris Saint-Germain, ESPN reports. The Ligue 1 club wants to sign Ramos on a free transfer after the defender’s contract with Real Madrid expired on Wednesday. Ramos announced in June that he would leave Madrid, ending his 16-year stay with the LaLiga giants. Sources close to the deal that will take him to PSG, claim things have advanced throughout the week and a final decision is expected in the coming days. Ramos wants a two-year deal, but PSG are only offering one with a second year as an option to be triggered by mutual content. His wages should also be lower than what he was earning in Spain and what he would have earned had he stayed at the Bernabeu. The Spain international, who turned 35 in March, didn’t strike an agreement with Madrid due to discrepancies over the length of the deal. Both Manchester City and Bayern Munich are also monitoring Ramos’ situation, but it is believed he favours a move to France.
