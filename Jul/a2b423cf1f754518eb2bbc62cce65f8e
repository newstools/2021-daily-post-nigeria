Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has urged members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to dump the opposition party. Tinubu said PDP members should realize that they cannot achieve anything good for Nigeria under the party. He made the call while welcoming Governor Bello Matawalle into the APC. In a statement by his media aide, Tunde Rahman, the former Lagos State governor said the recent defections of PDP governors to APC shows the ruling party can accommodate people with ideas that would lift Nigeria. Defection: Why our Governors are joining APC – PDP Tinubu said: “May other well-meaning people in the PDP also come to the realisation that the PDP is not the place to achieve what is good and constructive for Nigeria and may they also change station accordingly. “The nation has entered a historic moment. Now is not the time to waste your time and effort. Come and join the APC so that we all can work in better unison to build a better nation. “Matawalle understood that the PDP was not the way, and wisely decided to part company with those who would pull the nation backward. “The APC’s doors are open to those who want democracy to flourish. The entry of Governors Matawalle, Umahi and Ayade into the party demonstrates that the APC umbrella is sufficiently broad to accommodate all those with valuable ideas and contributions to the party and our country.” Defection: Ayade says more Govs will dump PDP soon, lists those to join him in APC
