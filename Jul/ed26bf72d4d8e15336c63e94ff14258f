The Governor noted that Nigerians need relief from banditry, kidnapping and terrorism. According to Wike: “The heightening degree of insecurity in Nigeria and the obvious inability of the APC-led federal government to tackle remains Nigeria’s greatest problem. “We are in desperate need of relief from daily incidents of kidnapping and mindless killings insurgents, herdsmen, bandits and terrorists. “The APC-led government must step up and be alive to its constitutional responsibility to protect lives and property in all parts of the country or admits its lack of capacity and resign before this country collapses.” Insecurity: Nigeria 50 years backward, El-Rufai reaping from evil plotted against Rivers – Wike
