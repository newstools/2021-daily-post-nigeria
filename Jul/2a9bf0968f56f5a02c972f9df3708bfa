The Delta State Police Command has arrested two suspected cultists in connection with the alleged assassination of one German Believe, who was shot dead at Imoniyame Street in Ughelli Community in Ughelli North Local Government Area of the state. The suspects were arrested at Otor-Edo Community in Ughelli South Local Government Area. Also arrested is the girlfriend of one of the suspects, Elohor Maureen Idolor. The third suspect was arrested for allegedly acting as a spy to the assassins who murdered the deceased German Believe a.k.a, Ajuwe. Upon interrogation, the mother of one confessed to have committed the offence. She said one of the suspects simply identified as Junior is her boyfriend. According to Elohor Maureen Idolor, an indigene of Olomoro Community in Isoko South Local Government Area, her boyfriend and others told her that they had issues with the victim who was a regular customer at a popular hotel in Imoniyame street, Ughelli. Idolor, who was a former staff of the hotel, said the ugly incident occurred after she left the hotel. When asked why she acted as a spy on the deceased whom she claimed dated her own friend, she said, it was the devil’s hand work. When contacted for comments, the Delta State Police Command led by CP Ari Muhammed Ali debunked the report. In a WhatsApp message sent to our correspondent in Warri by the Acting Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe said, “It’s not confirmed that they were the ones that killed the victim, but yes two cultists were arrested and suspected to be the killers.” The deceased, German Believe was shot dead last week in a hotel at Imoniyame Street in Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State.
