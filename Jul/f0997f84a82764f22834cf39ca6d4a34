Arsenal are ready to let Alexandre Lacazette, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Reiss Nelson leave this summer, according to Sky Sports. Joe Willock’s future with the Gunners is also in the balance, with the club yet to decide on whether they see a role for him. Lacazette’s contract is due to expire in one year and no talks underway or planned over a new deal. The 30-year-old will be allowed to leave as a free agent in 2022, if no suitable offers come in for him during this transfer window. EPL: Play me or let me go – Arsenal star tells Arteta Lacazette cost Arsenal around £47m four years ago and they would obviously not get anything close to that money now. With his wages reportedly around £180,000-a-week, the club are very keen to get him off the books and free up space on the wage bill for new players. Both Maitland-Niles and Nelson are deemed surplus to requirements and offers will be considered for both players. Willock, who spent last season at Newcastle United on loan, appears to have convinced Mikel Arteta to give him another chance. The 21-year-old scored eight goals in 14 games in the second half of the last campaign, netting in each of the last six league matches for the Magpies
