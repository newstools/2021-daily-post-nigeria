A former senatorial aspirant under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Harry Ugochukwu Nwachukwu, also known as Ugo Sly, has described the party in Imo State as a bad loser. The politician said the party is reputed for its internal politics which, according to him, has necessitated the mass exodus of its members within a period of two years. The political heavyweight, who hails from Ogwa Mbaitoli LGA, joined the All Progressive Congress (APC) after his senatorial outing in 2019 where he lost out during the party primaries. He was said to have decamped to the ruling APC with well over 7000 supporters from the PDP in the nine LGAs in Owerri zone. In an interview with newsmen, the former PDP stalwart said he had come to face realities of politics and to erase the deep cut inflicted on him by his former party. “The party is a bad loser because they are finding it difficult to accept defeat. They should allow the government of Senator Hope Uzodinma to focus and stop heating up the polity by cooking up propaganda. He continued, “I didn’t actually defect, rather, I have come to face the realities of politics. You all know how I was treated in the PDP. I was denied the primary election which I won by a wide margin. “Today, I am no longer in the PDP, that was in the past. I am a full member of the All Progressive Congress. I have already registered in my ward and I am ready to stake everything for the success of the party come next election. “PDP should learn how to maintain a level playing ground for all its aspirants lest, the party won’t move forward,” he added.
