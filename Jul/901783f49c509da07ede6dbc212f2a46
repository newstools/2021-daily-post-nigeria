Three percent (3%) has reportedly been deducted from the salaries of civil servants in Katsina State to help affected victims and rebuild the state’s Central Market gutted by fire in March 2021. The state government reportedly made the deduction from workers salaries for the month of June. Some of the affected workers confirmed the deductions to DAILY POST when contacted. Recall that the Katsina State government announced that all categories of the state civil servants and political office holders will contribute part of their salaries to support the victims of the Katsina Central Market Fire Disaster. Recall that the state Governor, Aminu Bello Masari while fielding questions from journalists in May said they resolved to deduct salaries of civil servants to rebuild the market because they consume over 80% of the state’s allocation. “Civil Servants are the ones eating up over 80% of what is coming to Katsina State. So, if we say contribute 3%, is that too much? The market sells to who? Is it not selling to the people of Katsina State?
So, everybody will contribute. I am contributing 20%. All the political appointees in the state will contribute 20%. “For the civil servant, what is 3% of thirty thousand? Is it up to three hundred naira? Masari said
