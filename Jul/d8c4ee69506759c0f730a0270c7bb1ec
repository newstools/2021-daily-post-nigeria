Four women on Wednesday were arrested in Benin City, the capital of Edo State, for selling donkey meat, popularly known as ‘jaki’ to unsuspecting buyers at the New Benin Market. Permanent Secretary, Edo State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mr. Peter Aikhuomobhogbe accompanied by Assistant Director, Department of Veterinary Public Health and Medical Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Dr. Peter Osagie who led the team to effect the arrest said the team was alerted that some persons were engaged in the sales of the meat despite its prohibition in the state. According to the Permanent Secretary; Is an issue of food safety. In Edo state, donkey meat is not approved as one of the meats that we consume but our people still indulge in it. We will take all necessary steps to ensure that we eradicate its consumption in Edo State. “We will continue to ensure that we pursue those involved in the business so that we will bring them to justice because it is not right for us to provide food that is not healthy for our people.” Speaking, Assistant Director, Department of Veterinary Public Health and Medical Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Dr. Peter Osagie, noted that “Donkey meat is not part of the meat legislated for human consumption in Edo State; they do this business under the cover of darkness and secrecy. “Some of these animals being processed for human consumption have not undergone any form of inspection. Any animal that has not been inspected before being presented for human consumption is considered unsafe.”
