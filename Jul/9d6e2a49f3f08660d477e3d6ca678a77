Actress Iyabo Ojo has apologised to the Theatre Arts and Motion Pictures Practitioners Association of Nigeria (TAMPAN) following the controversy surrounding Baba’s Ijesha rape saga. DAILY POST had reported that TAMPAN, in its notice suspending Iyabo Ojo and Nkechi Blessing, accused the actresses of “reckless accusations, abuses and embarrassment of our sector”. This became necessary following their action on social media in relation to the rape case involving Olanrewaju Omiyinka, popularly called Baba Ijesha. Their decision has since been met with criticisms and knocks from celebrities as well as the parties affected. However, Iyabo Ojo on Thursday took to her Instagram page apologising to the elders for upsetting them. Her post read: “First and foremost I want to appreciate God almighty, all merciful, I love you Lord and I thank you for your constant protection, provision and guidance over me and my family. I’m forever grateful. “I will also want to use this opportunity to say a very BIG thank you to all my darling fans and loved ones for your constant love and support. Honestly I’m so overwhelmed and humbled, I will never take it for granted “To an able and ever humble president of Tampan, thank you very much sir. “Our big daddies @adebayo.salami @princejidekosoko @realyinkaquadri on behalf of @nkechiblessingsunday my darling aburo and my humble self, we apologise to you all. “We are sorry for getting you upset, you’re our elders and leaders, we respect you, we’re humbled before you, we will forever appreciate you and honour you. It’s all Peace and Love.”
