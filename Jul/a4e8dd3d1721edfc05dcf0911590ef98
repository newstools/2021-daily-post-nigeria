Italy defender, Leonardo Bonucci, has mocked Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo and France’s Paul Pogba by consuming Coca-Cola and Heineken drinks following his country’s Euro 2020 final victory against England on Sunday night. Bonucci drank the Euro 2020 sponsored beverages in the media room during his post-match press conference following Italy’s win against England. Earlier in the Euro 2020, Ronaldo made global headlines after moving the Coca-Cola bottles positioned in front of the players speaking to the media due to his preference for the healthier option of water.

However, Bonucci instead opened a bottle of each of the aforementioned drinks in the post-match celebrations. After swigging a Heineken at the presser, Bonucci said: “I deserved this one, didn’t I?” Euro 2020: Pogba removes bottle of Heineken during press conference The centre-back then picked up a Coke bottle and drank from it before stating: “I will drink everything tonight.”
