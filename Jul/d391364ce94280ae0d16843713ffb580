Abuja-based right activist, Deji Adeyanju, has exposed an alleged plot by the All Progressives Congress, APC, to create a faction within the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. In a tweet, the convener of Concerned Nigerians Group wrote: “APC will soon create a faction in PDP if care is not taken. You heard it here first.” This is coming at a time several top chieftains of the PDP defected to APC. PDP, in the last six months lost some governors and lawmakers to the APC. Governor of Ebonyi, Dave Umahi; Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State, and Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State have all dumped the former ruling party. Also, Senators like Sahabi Ya’u from Zamfara North, Lawali Hassan Anka from Zamfara West, and Peter Nwaoboshi from Delta North have defected to APC from PDP. Recently, APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu had urged members of PDP to defect to the ruling party. Tinubu had claimed that PDP members can not achieve anything for Nigeria under the platform of the former ruling party.
