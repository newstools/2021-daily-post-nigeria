Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has predicted that England will defeat Italy in the final of Euro 2020 on Sunday. Rohr believes the Three Lions is a more complete team with a better tactical approach than the Azzurris. England needed extra time to see off Denmark 2-1 in the semi-final, while Italy qualified after a tense penalty shoot-out against Spain. When Rohr was asked which team will come out victorious at Wembley, he told Nation Sport: “Of course, England is favourite at home. “They are a complete team, physically and tactically on the top. “The fans are a big support, but I regretted their attitude to whistle the opponents, even the national anthem.” England are yet to win a major trophy since they lifted the World Cup in 1966.
