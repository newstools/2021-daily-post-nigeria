Brazil forward, Neymar Jr, has said he hopes to face Argentina in the final of this year’s Copa America. Neymar was speaking after they beat Peru 1-0 in Monday’s semi-final. Lucas Paqueta scored the only goal in the 35th minute, as Selecao booked their place in Saturday’s decider at the Maracana stadium. The second semi-final between Argentina and Colombia will be played Tuesday. “I want Argentina, I am cheering them on,” Neymar said with a smile. “I have friends there and in the final Brazil will win.” The last time the two countries met in a Copa America final was in 2007.
