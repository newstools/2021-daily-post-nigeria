Argentina captain, Lionel Messi, mocked Yerry Mina, asking him to “dance now,” as they beat Colombia on penalties in the Copa America semi-final on Tuesday. Mina missed his side’s third penalty during the shoot-out. The game ended 1-1 after 120 minutes. Mina’s usual celebration style is to dance after scoring goals and he pulled out his trademark celebration in the quarterfinal after netting in the shootout win over Uruguay. However, after his kick was saved by Emiliano Martinez on Tuesday, TV footage cut to Messi shouting “dance now” at his former Barcelona team-mate from the halfway line. The footage also picked up Martinez’s efforts to put off Mina in the build-up to the penalty. “Look, the ball’s not on the spot,” he told the referee as the centre-back stepped up to shoot. He then shouted at Mina: “You’re nervous, huh? I can tell you’re nervous. I know where you’re going to shoot. Watch and see how I’m going to eat you up. Remember, I’m going to eat you up.” Luis Diaz’s second-half goal cancelled out Lautaro Martinez’s opener for Argentina and took the game to penalties, with no extra time in the Copa America except for in the final. In the shootout, Martinez also saved from Davinson Sanchez and Edwin Cardona to help the Albiceleste progress to Saturday’s final against Brazil at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro.
