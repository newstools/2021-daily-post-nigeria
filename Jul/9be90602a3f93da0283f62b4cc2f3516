Four persons are reported to have been kidnapped by armed criminals in Egbeda community in Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers State. The incident was said to have taken place in the early hours of Monday. It comes barely two days after passengers of a commercial bus were abducted at the Omudioga axis of Omoku-Elele road in the same local government. The leader of a local vigilante group in the area, Alex Umezurike, who confirmed the attack said the hoodlums invaded the community, broke into the houses of their targets and kidnapped two persons. According to him, the kidnappers later moved to the major road in the area and abducted two others persons. He said “At about 1am in the early morning today, the Egbeda DPO called me as OSPAC commander in Omodioga that there is a kidnap going on in Egbeda road that I should call my boys and let’s see how we can support”. Throughout the night we were along the pipeline tracing the bad boys to Awara in Imo state.” He however noted that the vigilante boys were unable to apprehend the kidnappers.
