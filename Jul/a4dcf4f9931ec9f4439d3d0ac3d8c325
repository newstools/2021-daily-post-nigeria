Former Senator representing Zamfara Central Senatorial District, Kabir Marafa, has said appointing Mai Mala Buni as caretaker chairman of the All Progresive Congress (APC) is against the constitution of the party. Marafa stated this in an interview with Arise Television over Buni’s proclamation that Zamfara State Governor, Alhaji Bello Mohammed Matawalle is the leader of the party in the state following his defection from the People’s Democratic party (PDP). He said Buni as the caretaker chairman of APC does not have the power to make such a pronouncement. Over 1,000 supporters of ex-Gov, Yari, Marafa dump APC, join PDP in Zamfara “It is better for APC to let the sleeping dog lie. “Time will come we are going to challenge even his legality of him been a Chairman of APC “When you look at APC constitution especially section 17, sub 4 it prevented him from becoming APC chairman, so we are going to ask the question when the need arises,” he said. Marafa explained that Matawalle can never continue to be the Governor after his defection. “Based on the ruling of the Supreme Court, APC cannot have a Governor, Members of House of Representatives or state House of Assembly. “The judgment made by the Supreme Court says APC ought not to participate in the 2019 election in Zamfara State, that means there was no APC at all. “So every attempt by anybody to say that he is a Governor of APC between 2019 to 2023 without reason of death or resignation is challenging the ruling of Supreme Court. Zamfara governor’s defection: Senator Marafa reads riot act “So please APC all Zamfara people are saying be fair and just to us,” he said. Marafa said the APC should not interfere because doing that will ignite serious problems that can spell doom for the party.
