Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, the Spiritual Director of the Adoration Ministry Enugu, Nigeria (AMEN), has declared that Nigerian Christianity has been hijacked by corrupt politicians. The controversial Catholic priest while speaking on the state of the nation in a sermon, slammed pastors and priest for keeping mum when Nigerians are dying of hunger and other challenges bedeviling them. The popular gospel preacher and recently one of the critics of President Muhammadu Buhari, accused some men of God of extorting money from jobless church members. He said, “We men of God have gone corrupt, we have eaten the dish of the devil. We have started romancing with dirty politicians. “They have moved money into the church and caged, merchandise prophetic auctions. Time is coming when many children of God will be arrested. And men of God will just pray for their souls when to die. “Our people are jobless but we can not talk, yet we need money from the jobless people. What type of Christianity is that? “Who is fooling who? You are free to hate or love me. That one is your business. I am operating in the love of God and in the Holy Spirit”. ‘1 million Pantamis can’t stop spread of Christianity in North’ – Apostle Johnson Suleman
