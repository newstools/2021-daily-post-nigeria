Wamakko, who was a former Sokoto State Governor, said: “Ensuring security is a collective agreement of all of us, the Government, the citizens, as well as all and sundry.” He also stressed the need for the citizens to provide credible intelligence to the various security agencies as they need support of all and sundry. According to Wamakko,” it is only when all hands have been put on deck that the menace of insecurity in the country can be adequately tackled, otherwise the security agencies would be labouring in vain.”
