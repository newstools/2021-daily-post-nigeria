Coronation Asset Management has released its report on financial institutions titled “Nigerian Banks, Resilience Built In”. The report shows that Nigerian banks’ earnings have been remarkably resilient over the interest rate cycle. It confirms that their profitability is improving over time and their stock values are remarkably cheap compared to Ghanaian and Kenyan bank stocks. The report, written by Ope Ani and Guy Czartoryski of Coronation Research, examined what has happened within the Nigerian Banking industry in the last decade. It conducted a 10-year study of the margins and profitability of six listed banks: Zenith Bank; GT Bank; Access Bank; FBN Holdings; UBA, and Stanbic IBTC. Findings confirmed that the banks adapted successfully to many changes in interest rates from 2010 to 2020 and are well-positioned for the rise in rates in 2021. Guy Czatoryski a Senior Research Analyst at Coronation Research said while underlying growth in assets has been elusive, especially when data are adjusted for inflation, profitability has generally improved. “The return on average equity (RoAE) and return on average assets (RoAA) of the six banks studied have both converged and improved over 10 years. “This trend appears to be under-appreciated by investors, and the report shows the positive investment potential in the sector”, Czatoryski added.
