Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, has condemned in strong terms the unprovoked and unwarranted attack in Dabna and other surrounding villages in Hong Local Government Area of Adamawa State by suspected Boko Haram terrorists in which eighteen persons so far were feared killed in the early hours of yesterday. Mustapha, in a statement on Thursday, by Willie Bassey, Director Information office of the SGF, called on the people of Dabna to remain calm and be vigilant while security operatives are doing their best to provide security in the area. DAILY POST reports that Dabna lies close to Garaha, the village where Mustapha hails from, and not far from Kwapre, the scene of a recent Boko Haram attack in the same Hong LGA. According to Mustapha, Dabna is a peace-loving community made up of peasant farmers and other artisans who eke out their living through farm work and would not warrant any attack by mindless and godless persons. Mustapha vowed that the Federal Government of Nigeria will provide succour to the affected people and urged emergency agencies to come to the aid of those affected by the attack. The SGF commiserated with the Government and people of Adamawa and families of those who lost their loved ones. He, however, prayed to God to give them the fortitude to bear the loss.
