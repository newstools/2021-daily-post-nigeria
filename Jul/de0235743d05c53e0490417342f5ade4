Argentina winger, Angel Di Maria, has revealed what captain Lionel Messi told him after the Albiceleste defeated Brazil 1-0 in the 2021 Copa America final on Sunday morning. According to Di Maria, Messi told him “thank you” after Argentina defeated Brazil at the Rio de Janeiro’s Maracana stadium. The Paris Saint-Germain star said that Messi told him that it was his final, that it was the rematch for the finals that he couldn’t play. Di Maria’s first-half goal gave Argentina their first major title in 28 years as they beat Brazil. The former Manchester United star got the winner midway through the first half when he lobbed Brazil goalkeeper Ederson after full back Renan Lodi failed to cut out a long-through ball. “It is going to be unforgettable as Messi told me thank you I said thanks to him,” Di Maria was quoted by Goal as saying after the game. “He told me that it was my final, that it was the rematch for the finals that I couldn’t play. It had to be today and today it was.” Di Maria added, “I’m happy for my daughters, my wife, my parents, all the people who supported us and for all the crazy people who came here. “A World Cup is coming up soon and this is a huge boost.”
