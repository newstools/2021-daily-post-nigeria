Kwara State Elders Forum of the All Progressives Congress, APC, on Thursday, called for the suspension and removal of the Information Minister, Lai Mohammed from the party for alleged anti-party activities in the state. Addressing newsmen in Ilorin, spokesman for the forum, Sunday Fagbemi said Lai Mohammed’s continuous support for factionalisation of the party was divisive and disruptive. He spoke extensively on the intra-party crisis in the state, accusing Lai Mohammed of being the brain behind the factions in the party in the state. “We call for his removal as a minister from the cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari, for he is no longer fit to represent the interest of people of Kwara state.” ” He shamelessly came in from Abuja to fan the ember of disunity within the party by unveiling an illegal factional secretariat of the party,” he added. Fagbemi alleged that majority of those who attended the unveiling ceremony of Lai Mohammed’s secretariat are members of his erstwhile campaign organisation, LAI MOHAMMED CAMPAIGN ORGANISATION, (LAMCO), to whom he distributed cars and motorcycles belonging to APC in the 2019 elections.” He alleged that the same set of people who claimed they had defected to Third Force and burnt brooms,(APC identity) were the same set of people who gathered at Lai Mohammed’s secretariat. Fagbemi recalled that at the occasion of the opening of the secretariat, Lai Mohammed said Congresses will not hold in Kwara as against the well-advertised position and directives of the National Headquarters of the party which asserted that congresses will hold in the state as well as other states. He asserted that “The estranged relationship between Lai and the governor, who by the party’s constitution, is the leader of the party in the state is most uncalled for.
