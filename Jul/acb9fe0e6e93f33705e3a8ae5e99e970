Nigerian singer, Peruzzi has reacted to a viral post of a lady saying she dreamt he died. A lady, identified as Daffy Blanco, in an Instagram post said she dreamt that Peruzzi died. She warned the singer to stay safe and be careful. Her post is coming hours after the death of Davido’s close aide, Obama DMW. She also recalled how she was good friends with Peruzzi and shared the same pain of losing their mothers before things went sour. Daffy, however, said she has forgiven the singer because life is too short to hold grudges. Her post read: “I want to use this hour, this minute and this second to get this off my chest. “I just realized how we take 24hrs for granted! A few days ago I came across some pictures and videos of me and Peruzzi. I watched them and laughed so much. “Apart from everything that happened we were once cool, we spoke the same language and shared the same pain of losing our mothers. “A day before yesterday I had a bad dream that he was dead. In that very dream I was crying and so emotional I kept saying no no it’s not possible, Not My Huncho! When I woke up I thanked God that it was just a dream.” “Please take care of yourself please be safe! Life is too short for me to hold grudges. Love wins.” Peruzzi responding on his Instagram story rebuked every bad dream about him. He wrote: “No weapon fashioned against me shall prosper and that’s on default.”
