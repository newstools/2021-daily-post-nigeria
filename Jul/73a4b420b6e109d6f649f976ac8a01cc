The former Vice President said this while condemning the abduction of an unspecified number of students from Bethel Baptist High School, Damishi, Chikun local government area of the state, describing it as one too many. He stated that it is time to stop pretending that all is well with Nigeria and time for the government to perform its primary responsibility which is protecting lives. Atiku on his Twitter page wrote: “This is one abduction too many. We cannot continue to pretend that all is well. All is not well. Protection of lives and property is the primary responsibility of the government. And it is time that government begins to live up to its responsibilities.
