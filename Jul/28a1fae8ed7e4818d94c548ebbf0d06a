Germany and Real Madrid midfielder, Toni Kroo on Friday announced his retirement from international football. Kroos said he planned in the next few years to place his full concentration on Real Madrid. The 31-year-old made the announcement in a tweet through his official Twitter page. His retirement comes a few days after Germany was knocked out of the ongoing Euro 2020 by England. “I have played 106 times for Germany. There will not be another time,” Kroos tweeted. He added, “I had already made the decision to retire after this tournament [European championship] for some time. “It had been clear to me for a while that I will not be available for the World Cup 2022 in Qatar. ”Mainly because I want to focus fully on my goals with Real Madrid for the next few years. From now on I will deliberately give myself breaks that I haven’t seen as a national player for eleven years. “I would also like to be there more as husband and father for my wife and children.”
