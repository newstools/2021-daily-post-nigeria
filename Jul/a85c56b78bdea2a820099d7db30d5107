Chief Tony Okocha, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State has kicked against his former principal, Rotimi Amaechi’s insistence in zoning the party’s governorship ticket to the Riverine area. Okocha declared that Amaechi, who is the current Minister of Transportation, cannot decide where the next governor of the State will come from. Okocha, who was Chief of Staff, Government House, Port Harcourt, during Amaechi’s reign as governor, said this at the inauguration of the Obio/Akpor LGA chapter of a political pressure group, the Rivers Voice of Freedom (RVF). Okocha said no individual had the responsibility to zone the party’s governorship’s sole ticket to any zone of the region. “Well, he spoke his mind; he didn’t speak the mind of the party. I don’t think he spoke for the APC. He spoke as an individual,” he said. “Just like the Southern Governors that want the Presidency to come to the South and people from the North are kicking against it, that is the Honourable Minister’s opinion. It has nothing to do with Rivers people,” he added.
