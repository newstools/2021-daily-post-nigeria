Arsenal have made more changes behind the scenes, with assistant first-team coach Andreas Georgson leaving the club while Nicolas Jover arrives from Manchester City. Georgson, who joined the Gunners in August 2020, returns to his native Sweden with Malmo. Head coach, Mikel Arteta, has moved quickly to bolster his backroom team, with a familiar face joining him from Etihad Stadium. Jover, who left City when his contract expired in June, replaces Georgson. He has been acquired as a set-piece specialist, having held a similar post with the Premier League champions. When coaching alongside Pep Guardiola, Jover got the opportunity to work with Arteta. Arsenal will begin their 2021/2022 campaign against Brentford on August 13.
