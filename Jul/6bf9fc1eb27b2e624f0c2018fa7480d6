An angry fan, Cris Pinto, has decided to set up a petition to UEFA with change.org in a bid to get the Euro 2020 semi-final between England and Denmark replayed. The game was settled in the first half of extra time by a controversial penalty incident. Joakim Maehle tried to get the ball and was deemed to have made contact with Raheem Sterling’s leg. Dutch referee Danny Makkelie pointed to the spot and after a VAR review, the decision was upheld. Harry Kane buried his effort at the second time of asking, after Kasper Schmeichel saved his initial kick, making it 2-1. The ‘Rematch England vs Denmark’ petition started by Pinto reads: “We wish to overrule the penalty decision against Denmark. It was a wrong call, there needs to be contact for a penalty and there was absolutely no contact. “If this is not overruled, it would show a failure by UEFA and the beautiful game of football.” At the moment, the petition has not gathered up to 1,000 signatures. Although there is no chance of UEFA replaying the match, its success is probably a good gauge of where people stand on the decision. Euro 2020: UEFA hit with petition to replay France vs Switzerland
