Youths from the 19 Northern states and Abuja, under the auspices of Arewa Youth Forum (AYF) have urged the Southern states Governorsâ€™ Forum to first settle the agitation and impasse in their region before talking about the presidency in 2023. A communique issued by Gambo Ibrahim Gujungu, chairman of the forum at the end of their meeting, lamented that the Southern Governors were not concerned about how Nigeria would come out of the present predicament of insecurity and economic hardship but were only concerned about where the President would come from. The communique advised the governors to employ all available means to settle the problems ravaging their region before considering which region would produce the President come 2023. The participants noted that insecurity and self determination protests ongoing in the South should be resolved and tackled to give way for meaningful resolution of the challenges confronting the country. The communique expressed concern with the destruction of government facilities and killing of Nigerians. According to AYF, the resolution of the Governors is not only unconstitutional but detrimental to the cooperate existence of the country. The meeting noted that anybody that would come out for the presidency in 2023 either from the South or North must have the requisite leadership qualities to unite and ensure the progress of the country. The meeting expressed displeasure on the Southern governors rejection of the proposed 3% share of the oil revenue to the host community as recommended by the House of Representatives. AYF believed that most of the resolutions of the Southern governors are sentimental, stressing that a President could come from any region so long he would be able to deliver the dividends of democracy to Nigerians.
