Roma manager, Jose Mourinho, has warned England to expect a ‘difficult’ Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark when both teams clash on Wednesday. Mourinho believes the Denmark team is solid despite playing without their number 10, Christian Eriksen. Denmark booked their place in the Euro 2020 semi-final on Saturday after beating Czech Republic 2-1, while England thrashed Ukraine 4-0. Mourinho reveals what he did when Christian Eriksen collapsed “Denmark are solid. They also found a way to play different than the way they started,” Mourinho told talkSPORT. “They started, of course, with Christian Eriksen as a no.10 and with a back four. They are now playing with three at the back, a solid team, good players playing in the best leagues with lots of experience. “They are very positive in spite of what happened to Christian and it looks that they are emotionally strong. “I think it is, of course, going to be a difficult match for England despite England playing well and being at home.” Euro 2020: Mourinho warns England ahead of ‘difficult’ semi-final
