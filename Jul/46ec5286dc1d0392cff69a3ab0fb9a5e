The president of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, has told players selected from the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) to play their game when they face Mexico in an international friendly. According to Pinnick, the head coach of the team, Gernot Rohr, is hard to please. The game will be played in the early hours of Sunday morning at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. However, Nigeria will be without foreign-based players. Rohr had initially decided not to take charge of the team, but he has now made a u-turn and will be in the dugout. Given how Rohr has depended heavily on players abroad since he arrived, the NPFL players would have to step up to impress the 68-year-old gaffer. “Rohr is difficult to impress, I want you all to just play to the level of your quality,” Pinnick said in an address to the players.
