The Catholic Bishop of Jalingo Diocese, Most Rev Charles Hammawa, on Saturday charged all Nigerians to match words with actions to end insecurity in the country. The Bishop said that Nigerians need to tell themselves the truth to be able to defeat the forces of evil that are working against the peace and security of Nigeria. Hammawa gave the charge while delivering a homily at the graduation of Catechists at the Catholic Catechetical Training Institute in Jimlari, near Jalingo. “The world has never been without challenges, but the challenges facing Nigeria now are enormous. “The growing insecurity in Nigeria is worrisome and need to be urgently addressed. “In Taraba, the crisis is quite disturbing and the Catholic church is always the worst hit anytime it erupts. “Presently, many parishes in our diocese are closed, many lives have been lost in these crises and valuable property destroyed. “This situation calls for action, we need to tell ourselves the truth to be able to defeat the forces of evil that are working against the peace and security of Nigeria,” he said. The cleric also charged the graduands to be objective and fearless in discharging their duties for the good of the church and the society.
