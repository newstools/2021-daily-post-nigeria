Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has insisted that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has always been weak since President Muhammadu Buhari came into power in 2015. The Governor stated this on Channels Television’s Politics Today. According to him, PDP is doing its best to get leaders of the APC into their party ahead of the 2023 general election. Gov. Sule cautions against reprisal over killing of MACBAN leaders Sule said, “We have been a very strong party, and we are doing the best we can to continue to be stronger and the only way we can be stronger is to get more and more people and the right people to get are the leaders of the opposition. That is what we are trying to do and God is so kind we are doing that.” Asked if the desire of the APC is to plunder the opposition such that come 2023, only the ruling party will be standing, Sule said, “PDP has always been weak since President Muhammadu Buhari came in,” adding that all that is being seen at the moment is that the party is becoming “weaker and weaker.” Governor Sule’s comments come on the heels of the latest defection by Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State. In the last seven months, PDP has lost some governors and lawmakers to the APC. Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State, and Matawalle have all dumped the opposition party. Southerner should succeed Buhari for peace in Nigeria – Gov Sule
Also, Senators like Sahabi Ya’u from Zamfara North, Lawali Hassan Anka from Zamfara West, and Peter Nwaoboshi from Delta North have defected to APC. On Monday, the PDP, through its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, had said Metawale and others could not decamp with the party’s mandate. Ologbondiyan said the mandate was given to the party, not Matawalle.
