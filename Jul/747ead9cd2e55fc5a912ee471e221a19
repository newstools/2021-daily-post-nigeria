Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan has blamed the Department of State Services, DSS, for the abduction of students of Bethel Baptist High School, Kaduna. Recall that some students of Bethel Baptist in Kaduna State were kidnapped by bandits. Two personnel, Private Salisu Rabiu and Ordinary Seaman Bilal Mohammed were killed while engaging the bandits who attacked the school and kidnapped an unspecified number of students in the early hours of Monday, 5th July 2021. Omokri took to his Twitter page, saying that the students would have been saved if DSS were sent to monitor schools in Northern states and not raid homes, like that of Sunday Igboho. Recall that the DSS recovered ammunition and arrested some members of Igboho’s camp after they raided Igboho’s residence in Ibadan. Omokri’s tweet read: “If instead of raiding Sunday Igboho’s residence, the DSS agents were sent to monitor schools in the affected Northern states, the 121 students of Bethel Baptist School would not have been abducted. And who abducted them? The same bandits/herdsmen Igboho is fighting.”
