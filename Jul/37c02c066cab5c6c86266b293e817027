A People Democratic Party (PDP) Chieftain, Hon Hogan Ita, has raised alarm over defection by members of the party and other politicians, describing their attitude as immature. He regretted that some members of his party defected to other parties over slight arguments or misunderstanding as well as provocation. Hon Ita, who spoke to newsmen on Thursday, regretted the action of politicians, describing their attitude as childish and uncompromising. “I want to make a strong appeal to Nigerian politicians and other stakeholders not to continually emphasise on which party is superior. “As far as I am concerned, politicians jump frequently from one party to another without necessarily imbibing the philosophies and doctrines of these parties. “Let us rather dwell more on individual politicians, their programmes and how they are able to execute such programmes. Let us look at marketable materials across party lines who have genuine desire for the people, not political parties,” he stated. He said even though he remains a PDP stalwart he makes genuine friendship with politicians from other parties, assuring that he would reciprocate the gestures from his friends from other parties who honoured him He advised that our politics should be on individuals’ capability and his blueprint for the people, “It is said that the names of the parties do not bring about success and achievements desired by the people.” According to him, politics should be based on individuals’ capability and his blueprint for the people.
