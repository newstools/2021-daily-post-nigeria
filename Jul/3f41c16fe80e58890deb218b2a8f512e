Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand has predicted England to win the Euro 2020 because the Three Lions are the best team in the competition. Ferdinand gave his prediction on Tuesday night as Italy defeated Spain 4-2 on penalties in the semi-final encounter, thanks to Chelsea midfielder Jorginho’s decisive spot-kick. Italy will now play the winner between England and Denmark in the Euro 2020 final on Sunday. “It doesn’t matter who has gone through here because I believe England can beat both these sides,” Ferdinand told BBC Sport post-match. “I just feel no one can compete with us right now. The confidence we have got… People might say I am getting carried away but I don’t care. “From what I have seen, England are the better team, the best team and they beat both of these teams [Italy and Spain].”
