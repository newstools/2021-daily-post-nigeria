Manchester United playmaker, Bruno Fernandes, has said he will have to wait one more year before he gets the no 8 shirt from Juan Mata. Mata has agreed a contract extension with the club. The Red Devils confirmed on Friday that the 33-year-old had agreed to stay at Old Trafford until June 2022. Fernandes previously wore the No 8 shirt at Sporting Lisbon and has worn the No 18 since arriving in Manchester. “I guess I’ll have to wait for the number 8 another year. “Congrats brother!! Well deserved! An example and an inspiration on and off the pitch,” Fernandes tweeted. Mata has made 273 appearances for United, scoring 51 goals in all competitions. However, in recent seasons he has become more of a peripheral figure; featuring in just 18 games last season.
