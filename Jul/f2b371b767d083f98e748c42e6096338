The Federal Government of Nigeria has announced that the country is set to end the transmission of HIV by 2022. Dr Gambo Aliyu, the Director-General of the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA), disclosed this during a courtesy visit of the Namibian High Commissioner to Nigeria to the agency in Abuja. According to him, Nigeria has achieved a critical milestone of getting HIV under control. Aliyu said: “There are things we can learn from Namibia, and what they can learn from our response here. “Strategic area to learn from them is in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Namibia has achieved 100 percent identification and placement of pregnant mothers who live with this. “This is the building block to end AIDS. To end AIDS, we must make sure the incoming generation doesn’t have AIDS. “This is an area we are looking forward to seeing how much we can learn from Namibia and adopt, to reduce the risk of re-inventing the wheel, and also losing efficiency. “This is one area we want to see between this year and next, to double our successes, to see that those taps that are running (as far as HIV/AIDS is concerned) in the country are no longer running. “Nigeria is now set to end AIDS because we have achieved a critical milestone of getting it under control. By next year, God willing, Nigeria should be able to control HIV transmission.” HIV/AIDS killing more than COVID-19 – Health expert warns FG
