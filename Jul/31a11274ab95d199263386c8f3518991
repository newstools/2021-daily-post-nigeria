From the bottom of my heart, I appreciate everyone who went out of their way to make my day. “Thank you to every club we went to. Thank you to everyone in Miami who held us down. ”Thank you to everyone back home and all around the world who celebrated me even in my absence. May you all be celebrated the same way.
