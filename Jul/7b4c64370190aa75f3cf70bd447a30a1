Arsenal hero, Emmanuel Petit, has handed Chelsea the name of a player to sign this summer. According to Petit, Chelsea should sign Borussia Dortmund striker, Erling Haaland. Petit believes Haaland is ‘the answer’ for Thomas Tuchel’s side ahead of next season. Haaland has drawn the interest of Chelsea and Petit wants the Blues to go all out to bring the Norway international to Stamford Bridge. “Chelsea needs a top striker, it is as simple as that,” Petit told Paddy Power. “Chelsea need a new striker and someone who scores lots of goals. Erling Haaland is the answer. He is strong, powerful and young, with a bright future in front of him. “Haaland’s value is already very high, and connections with [Thomas] Tuchel increase his chance of joining Chelsea. “Offensively, he could become the finisher that Chelsea really need. I can imagine his relationship with [Mason] Mount, [Kai] Havertz, [Christian] Pulisic and [Hakim] Ziyech making him score lots of goals at Stamford Bridge.” Man City vs Chelsea: Petit predicts Champions League final
