Paris Saint-Germain medical staff were “blown away” by Sergio Ramos’ physical condition during his tests, according to Mundo Deportivo. Ramos is now officially a PSG player and has signed a two-year contract with the Ligue 1 side. The Spanish defender became a free agent after leaving Real Madrid last month. He will be hoping to help Mauricio Pochettino’s team reclaim the title from Lille. Ramos arrived in Paris on Wednesday morning, accompanied by a 13-person entourage that included his entire family. He underwent his medical at noon, before heading to PSG’s offices with his wife and his children to sign his contract. The player is available for preseason, after being excluded from Luis Enrique’s La Roja squad at Euro 2020 this summer. He will earn about €12m net per season at PSG, the same figure he earned at Madrid.
