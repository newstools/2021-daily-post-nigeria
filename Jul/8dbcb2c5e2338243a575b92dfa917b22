Senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari sent a joint team of security operatives to the house of popular Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho simply because he (Igboho) is against the Fulani. DAILY POST had reported when Igboho and scores of his supporters stormed Igangan town in Oyo State to chase out Sariki Fulani, Salihu Abdulkadar following alleged killings being committed by herdsmen in the area and Pastor Giwa said this put together was the reason Buhari is seeking for the activist’s head. In a statement he made available to DAILY POST on Monday, Giwa said the “Truth is that Buhari and his Fulani men are after Sunday Igboho following his decision to chase Seriki Fulani, Salihu Abdulkadar out of Igangan community. What has the young man done to warrant the security agencies running after him? “They don’t mind cutting the head of anyone who is against the Fulani people. Don’t be a fool to think that they after Sunday Igboho because he is agitating for the independence of Yoruba people. No, absolutely incorrect because there are millions of Yoruba people home and abroad fighting for Yoruba Nation. “Let me warn the Fulani caliphate led by president Buhari that nothing must happen to Igboho. Why did they invade someone’s house at 1:30am? Only a thief does that! “They came to avenge what the young man did to criminal Fulani herdsmen in Igangan. The majority of security officials who invaded Igboho’s house and killed the innocent people were Fulani soldiers. Why didn’t they come in broad daylight? “They must fish out and punish those who killed the innocent citizens at Chief Sunday Adeyemo’s house. How many criminal Fulani herdsmen or bandits are in DSS custody in Abuja or in any prison across the country? “Buhari is rehabilitating Fulani criminals while persecuting those who want a better nation. The Lord will arise and put all of them to shame in Jesus Name.”
