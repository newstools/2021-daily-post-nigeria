Unknown gunmen have kidnapped a traditional ruler, the Adogu of Eganyi in Ajaokuta Local Government Area of Kogi, Alhaji Mohammed Adembe. The police spokesman in the state, DSP William Aya, who confirmed the incident to newsmen said that Adembe was kidnapped at about 5:20 pm on the Okene -Eganyi Road. According to him, the traditional ruler was returning to his community from Okene, also in Kogi, when he was kidnapped. “His car slowed down at one of the potholes on the road; the gunmen emerged from a nearby bush and started shooting sporadically into the air, thereby forcing him to a stop. “Other occupants of the vehicle were spared as the gunmen marched only the traditional ruler into the bush,’’ Aya explained. He added that policemen were already combing the surrounding area and the bush to rescue the victim and reunite him with his community.
