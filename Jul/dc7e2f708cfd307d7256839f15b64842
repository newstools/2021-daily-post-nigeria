Former Nigeria international, Finidi George, has tipped either Spain or Italy to win the ongoing European Championship. The quarter-final of the competition began on Friday evening. Spain eliminated Switzerland via penalties, while Italy beat Belgium 2-1. They will now face off in the last four. George feels the winner of the tournament will be decided in that game. “That’s a tough one but I tip Spain or Italy for the title. “They have won it in the past and the experience is there – which I believe will play a key role in terms of determining the winner. “However, any team can spring up surprises and win. You can never tell because this is football,” George told Goal.
