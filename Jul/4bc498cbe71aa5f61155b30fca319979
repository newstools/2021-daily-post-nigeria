Lionel Messi “suffered a lot” with comparisons to Diego Maradona, according to the son of the Argentine legend, Maradona Jr. Messi finally broke his international trophy duck, after they beat Brazil 1-0 in the Copa America final. The relief at ending that barren run was clear for all to see, with Messi cementing his standing alongside 1986 World Cup winner Maradona, who passed away at the age of 60 in November 2020. That has not been an easy journey, with Messi forever likened to his legendary compatriot, Maradona Jr is pleased to see that debate being brought to a close. He has told TyC Sports: “Diego was Diego and Messi was Messi. “The one who criticises Messi does not understand anything about football. He suffered a lot when they compare him with my father.”
