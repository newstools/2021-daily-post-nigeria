Nigerian Grammy award winner, Burna Boy, has addressed the supposed rift between him and Wizkid. The singer during an interview on his Insta live session was asked if he feels there was a competition between him and the “Ojuelegba” crooner. In his response, Burna Boy revealed that Wizkid is like a brother to him and no bad blood existed between them. He, however, revealed that the only difference between them was that he sings about real life while Wizkid sings about women.
