Rep. Kabiru Amadu (PDP-Zamfara) on Wednesday defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). This was contained in a letter read by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila during Wednesday’s plenary. In the letter, Amadu said being a representative of the people and having consulted with his constituency, he has decided to join the APC. Reacting, Rep. Tobi Okechukwu, Deputy Minority Leader, faulted the speaker’s position on the issue, saying he has failed to abide by the provisions of the Constitution by allowing mass defection of PDP lawmakers to APC. Gbajabiamila, however, objected to the statement, describing it as unparliamentary. Recall that five PDP lawmakers from Zamfara had earlier defected to the APC, making a total of six lawmakers who have left the PDP from the state.
