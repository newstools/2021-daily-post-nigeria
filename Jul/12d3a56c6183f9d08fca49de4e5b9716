Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State has assured the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, of his loyalty, stressing that he will not dump the party. Dir, who declared total commitment to the PDP on Sunday, was reacting to a call by a former Deputy Governor of the state, Peremobowei Ebebi to dump the party. Ebebi had said Diri should take a cue from other PDP governors and dump the party he described as a “sinking ship.” However, the Governor described the call to dump PDP as unfortunate, provoking, and unwelcoming. The Governor, however, said he appreciates the fact that the APC acknowledged that his administration is performing in the state. Diri spoke through his Director-General, New Media, Mr. Kola Oredipe. The Governor said dumping PDP amounts to political suicide. He maintained that he remained a strong, committed member of the party and had no reason to leave for another now or in the near future. He said, “Ebebi must be a joker. We know him for many acts of theatrics and at this time too, it is not different. He has confessed that the Governor is not doing badly, meaning that the PDP is on the right track; why then go to join a party that has taken Nigeria many years back?”
