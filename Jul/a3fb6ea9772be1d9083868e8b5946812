Aspirants of the local government caretaker committee, who did not make the lists of nominees, and their supporters have protested their non-inclusion which was last Thursday approved by the Osun State House of Assembly. The aspirants and their supporters, who were conveyed in 18 seater buses, stormed the Famson Street, Igbona, Osogbo residence of the State All Progressives Congress (APC) Chairman, Adegboyega Famodun. In a four-minute 45 second video monitored by DAILY POST, the protesting aspirants and their supporters. who are mostly from Iwo local government, disclosed that they were against the party leadership in the state and local government because most of them had decamped from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and never voted for their party during the 2018 gubernatorial election in the state. They also disclosed that they were against the decision of APC leaders in their local government for removing their names from the list and including their preferred candidates, adding that the 4+4 campaign slogan of the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, was no longer welcome in Iwo land. Famodun was also advised to steer clear of politics in Iwo because he has been found wanting of bias in his conduct. According to them, Famodun had overstepped his boundary and he had aligned with members who did not have the interest of the APC in mind. DAILY POST recalled that some APC members had on Monday morning stormed the premises of the Osun State House of Assembly demanding that the list be reviewed while in the evening, the country home of the Chairman of the APC Elders Council was stormed by protesters who set up bonfires demanding also that the list of their preferred candidate be re-included in the list of local government caretaker committee nominees. Meanwhile, the House of Assembly had yesterday started the process of screening the local government caretaker nominees after its approval last week Thursday.
