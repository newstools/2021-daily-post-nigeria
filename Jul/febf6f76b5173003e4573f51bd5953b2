Justice Peter Kekemeke of the FCT High Court, Nyanya, on Wednesday, sentenced a pastor to life imprisonment for raping a 17-year-old girl. Stephen Kalu, 29, a pastor of Adoration Ministry, Karshi in Abuja, was arraigned in October 2019 by the police on a two-count charge of rape. The convict had intercourse with a girl on October 28, 2018 at his residence in Karshi, without her consent. The offence was contrary to section 31 (1) of the Child’s Right Act and punishable under 31 (2) of the same Act, NAN reports. Justice Kekemeke determined that the prosecutor, Donatus Abah proved his case beyond reasonable doubt. He said the defendant admitted sleeping with the girl several times, resulting in a pregnancy and the birth of a baby girl. The judge noted that though the defendant promised to marry the victim, the offence had been committed and the law must take its course. Kekemeke ruled that count two was not relevant and convicted the defendant on count one, which contravened section 31 (1) of the Child’s Right Act. He said the society, especially the division of the court, has seen several cases of rape. Kekemeke added that due to the pathetic situation, the system must be expunged of rapists and kids protected. “The law is already there. The same defendant committed a similar offence of rape while on bail. He is a danger to our children, The defendant is hereby sentenced to life imprisonment”, he ruled.
