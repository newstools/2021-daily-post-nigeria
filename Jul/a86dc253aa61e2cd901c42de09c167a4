Katsina United, Sunday evening, at Muhammadu Dikko Stadium Katsina, defeated Ifeanyi Ubah FC 3-0 to extend their winning streak in the bid to avoid relegation from the Nigeria Professional Football League. The match, which commenced at exactly 4pm at the 3000 capacity stadium, was played behind closed doors in compliance with the COVID-19 safety precaution guidelines. The three goals scored in the first half in quick succession was all the home team needed to take the day. It is worth noting that all the goals came in the first half and were all registered within the span of 10 minutes. Samuel Kalu opened the score sheet for the host team 25 minutes into the encounter and without delay, scored the second in another five minutes after scoring the first goal. Before the visiting team, Ifeanyi Ubah FC, could settle down into the match, ‘in-form’ Joseph Atule added his name to the score sheet after 35 minutes into the play, making it three nil against the visiting team. However, in the second half, the visiting team seemed to have put their act together as they blocked all the leakages in the first half and denied the home team from scoring more goals throughout the second half of the encounter. However, the visiting team could not register any goal throughout the 90 minutes of play though they came close to scoring on a few occasions. With the recent form of the home team, and their extended winning streak, Katsina United is gradually distancing itself from being relegated from the NPFL. Nigeria vs Mexico: Super Eagles thrashed 4-0
