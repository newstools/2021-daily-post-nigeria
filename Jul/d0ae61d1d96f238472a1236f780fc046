Southerner should succeed Buhari for peace in Nigeria – Gov Sule The statement reads in part: “We understand why Northern Elders Forum and Arewa Consultative Forum, Focus on getting assurances from the South, of what the North stands to gain if they are allowed to succeed Buhari in 2023. “It’s obvious that the government’s incapacity to get lasting remedies for the insurgency and banditry is giving northern leadership sleepless nights but with the Igbo investments worth 22trillion naira and out of school northern children rising to 19 million from 19 Northern states, only a disciplined personality with Igbo entrepreneurial bravery and heroism can restore normalcy in the North”. “Arewa Youths do not seem to have a clearer picture of the dwindling fortunes of the North, with reported news of ” Borno state having two Governors, one led by( APC controlled 25 LGA) and ISWAP controlled 5 LGA). There are fears of ISWAP taking over the entire North, and Arewa youths assertion of North succeeding President Buhari will strengthen insecurity in the North and secessionist movements in the South. “It’s obnoxious that the Arewa youths allowed themselves to be misled by myopic political leaders, that had exhausted the chances of getting Northern Territory out of the insurgency for the last 10 years now, rather than sustaining educational programs of Jonathan for the North, they facilitate the youths into street begging and banditry. “Igbo Presidency in 2023 will undoubtedly restore Nigeria to the path of greatness and economic prosperity as Igbo Men and Women of proven integrity and willpower are in abundance to give Nigerians the much desired good governance anchored in economic advancement,” the group stated.
