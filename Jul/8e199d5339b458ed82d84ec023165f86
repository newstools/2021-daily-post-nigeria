The Senate Committee on Basic Education has said it would work towards amending the law establishing the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB to stop the board from admitting candidates below the age of 18 years. This was disclosed on Monday by the Vice Chairman of the committee, Senator Akon Eyakenyi, during the committee’s oversight visit to JAMB. According to the committee, age has a lot to do with learning ability, particularly in higher institutions. Senator Akon Eyakenyi noted that education is very important in the development of the country stressing that the sector deserves to be given much attention. The Senator described the JAMB as a bridge between the secondary and the university, stressing that the agency was a necessary vehicle for the delivery of quality and standard education in Nigeria. “If the products from the secondary schools are not properly catered for to be assessed before turning them into the university definitely you will have a problem,” she said.
