The Kwara State House of Assembly, on Tuesday, suspended the only Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, member in the House, Jimoh Raheem Abgoola for alleged contempt and abuse of privilege. DAILY POST reports that the House has 23 APC members of the 24 members of the legislature with Agboola as the only PDP member. The suspension followed a motion without privilege moved by the leader of the House, Abubakar Magaji Olawoyin during Tuesdayâ€™s plenary. Olawoyin, leading the debate on the motion, argued that the assembly is an institution and not an individual which must be respected. He accused Agboola of making a despicable comment about the House calling on the masses to stage a protest against the government and the House of Assembly on a radio programme aired on Tuesday morning. Olawoyin, who described the act at this period of insecurity as unsafe and could lead to chaos, said the suspended Agboola disrespected the honorable House, urging the speaker to investigate the matter which was already trending on the social media. Another lawmaker, representing Isin constituency, Olumide Awolola Ayokunle, said the derogatory language against the House should not be condoned, especially when such language was found to be false. Speaker of the House, Engr. Yakubu Salihu Danladi, assured the House of adequate investigation and directed the House Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Judiciary to conduct an nvestigation into the matter and report its findings to the House as soon as possible. The speaker, also directed the suspended PDP member to cease from attending plenary pending the conclusion of investigation into the matter. Reacting, the suspended PDP member, said the suspension will not stand the test of time. He alleged that the management of the House of Assembly, denied him some of his financial entitlements since he was sworn-in. Agboola, said he will soon make his position known to the public on the next line of action.
