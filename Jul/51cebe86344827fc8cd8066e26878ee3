Mr Gaza is the latest in the gale of defection that continues to rock the opposition party. The letter of defection was read by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila on Wednesday during plenary. The Governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Sule, and two of his predecessors, Sen Tanko Almakura and Sen Abdulahi Adamy were on the floor of the House to observe.
