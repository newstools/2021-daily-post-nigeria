Real Madrid defender, Raphael Varane, has agreed on personal terms with Manchester United, the UK Express reports. However, the stumbling block remains his transfer fee.

Transfer: Raphael Varane’s preferred move revealed Madrid is reluctant to allow Varane to leave in the same window where mercurial captain Sergio Ramos has left on a free transfer. The 28-year-old will be available to sign on a free transfer next summer and he is expected to be available for €60 million (£51.5m).
