Italy will, on Sunday night, face England in the Euro 2020 final at the Wembley Stadium.

Why I rejected Tottenham job – Conte “There are two very physical midfielders like Rice and Phillips, who bring balance, but very few vertical passes, often going for the simple option,” Conte wrote in his column for La Gazzetta dello Sport. “A weak spot for England is that if their defence is pressed when building out from the back, they are not as good as Spain at escaping the press. However, if you are ultra-attacking in your press and they do escape, then watch out for their pace up front. EPL: Conte gives Tottenham conditions to replace Mourinho “Again, this is when Italy must show their experience at reading the various moments of the game.” The kick-off time for Italy vs England is 8 pm.
