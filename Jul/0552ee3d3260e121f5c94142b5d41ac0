The Lagos State Government has denied closing down any school due to COVID-19 outbreak. The state’s Ministry of Education confirmed this on Tuesday night. In a statement its spokesman, Ganiu Lawal, the ministry said it did not order for two private schools in Lekki to be closed. “The reported closure of two private schools in Lekki did not follow a directive from the Government, as speculated in the media,” the statement read in part. It added that it “was a decision of the school proprietors to pre-empt the likelihood of further spread of a reported Covid-19 case by a parent at Standard Bearer Secondary School, Lekki.” Learning at both schools will continue online until further notice. The Commissioner advised school proprietors to continue to adhere strictly to COVID-19 preventive measures. Parents are urged to remain vigilant to ensure that the State Government’s efforts at reducing the negative effect of COVID-19 are not fruitless.
