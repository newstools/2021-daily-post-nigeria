The World Bank has hailed Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, for refunding US$4.63million surplus funds under the Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management project (NEWMAP). The letter of appreciation was signed by Regional Director, Shubham Chaudhuri. The institution said the action has made it possible to extend similar projects to other States facing deficit funds. Chaudhuri said the timeliness helped the bank’s decision to extend the closing date of the project from June 30, 2021 to June 30, 2022. The returned surplus, he noted, will ensure that other States finish their civil works, while Kogi focuses on completing its approved ongoing works. The World Bank urged the state government to bring the project to an orderly closure, while achieving its intended objective of transforming lives and alleviating poverty. “We also take this opportunity to request that you kindly also expedite the issuance of a required Letter of Comfort”, Chaudhuri added.
