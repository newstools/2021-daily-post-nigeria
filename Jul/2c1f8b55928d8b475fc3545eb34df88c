The management of the University of Lagos on Wednesday shut down the students’ hostels over reported cases of coronavirus on the campus. A member of the school’s senate confirmed this to reporters in the school. “After getting the report, which I don’t like to discuss with you, we decided that the hostels should be shut down.” He was, however, mute on whether the COVID-19 Delta variant was discovered on the university campus.
