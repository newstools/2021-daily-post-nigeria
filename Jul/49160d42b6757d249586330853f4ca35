Five persons, who were accused of kidnapping an eight-year-old boy, Sadiq Abass, in Ogun State, have been arrested by the police on Friday. The suspects, Abdul Raman Umar, Falalu Abubakar, Danjuma Bako, Idris Lawal and Fauziya Falalu were arrested following a complaint lodged at the Ogere Police Station by one Riliwan Mohammed. Mohammed had told the police that “he left his wife and three children at home at about 12 noon, only for him to receive a phone call from a strange number that his 8-year-old son had been abducted.” Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, quoted the complainant as saying that “the caller demanded for the sum of N3.5 million as ransom if he wanted to see the boy alive.” Upon the report, Oyeyemi told DAILY POST on Sunday that the DPO of Ogere division, CSP Abiodun Ayinde, quickly ”mobilized his crack detectives to go after the hoodlums.” He stated that the detectives embarked on a technical and intelligence-based investigation, leading them to the hideout of the suspects, where they were arrested and the victim rescued unhurt. DAILY POST reports that the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, has directed that the case be instantly transferred to the anti-kidnapping unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation.
