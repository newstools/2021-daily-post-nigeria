Barcelona captain Lionel Messi’s plans to leave his country Argentina were put on hold after a bomb scare at Rosario airport, which delayed his private jet leaving as reported by Mirror UK on Wednesday. Messi was set to return to Spain for his summer holidays on Tuesday after leading Argentina to the Copa America victory following a 1-0 win over Brazil last weekend at the Maracana Stadium. But a few hours before the 34-year-old was due to leave Argentina, a man claimed to have a bomb in his suitcase. Argentine security swiftly enforced their emergency protocols, evacuating the airport and halting all flights as well as Messi’s jet from leaving. “At 11:50 am, the airport security police (PSA) activated the preventive emergency plan due to a situation of suspicion. The building was evacuated as a precaution,” an airport statement read. Messi was looking to spend a few weeks abroad with his family before beginning his pre-season. He is however expected to sign a new deal with Barcelona later this month. Europa League: Why I’m scared of checking my phone – Arsenal’s Willian
