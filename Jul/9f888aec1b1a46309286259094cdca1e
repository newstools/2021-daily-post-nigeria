A 25-year-old Adetoro Kazeem of Paara Street, Alakia area of Ibadan has been arrested by the Ogun State Police operatives for alleged blackmail and extortion. Kazeem was arrested following a report by one Gloria Ogunnupebi, who reported at the Obalende divisional headquarters, Ijebu-Ode that, in May 2021, that she received a WhatsApp voice note from a foreign number, telling her to send the sum of N200,000 or have her nude pictures uploaded on the social media. The victim told the police that, to prevent the caller from exposing her to moral and public ridicule, she had sent the said amount to him; believing everything is over. “But surprisingly, the person continued demanding for money from her every two weeks, and that he has extorted her up to the tune of N7,363,900,” Ogun police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi told DAILY POST on Thursday. Oyeyemi quoted the woman as saying she got tired of the continuous extortion and started contemplating suicide. “Upon the report, the DPO of Obalende Division, SP Salami Murphy, mobilized his crack detectives to go after the suspect. The detectives embarked on intelligence and technical-based investigation, and they successfully tracked the suspect to his hideout in Ibadan Oyo State, where he was apprehended,” it was stated. On interrogation, the suspect was said to have confessed to the commission of the crime. He reportedly admitted to the investigators that “he has many OPAY accounts with different names through which he receives money from his victims.” Meanwhile, the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, had ordered an in-depth investigation into the past activities of the suspect with a view to charging him to court.
