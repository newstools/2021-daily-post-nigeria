A former Premier League referee Peter Walton has explained why VAR did not overturn England’s controversial penalty against Denmark during their semi-final clash on Wednesday night. Referee Danny Makkelie decided to penalise Jannik Vestergaard for making contact with England forward Raheem Sterling during the extratime of the absorbing contest. Denmark took the lead through Mikkel Damsgaard’s stunning free-kick but an own goal from Simon Kjaer helped the Three Lions back into the contest. England were unable to find a way through until they were awarded a spot kick in very unclear circumstances. Peter Walton explained on ITV, “It has to be a clear and obvious error, there’s also an upper body check by the Danish defender. I think this is a penalty and VAR is checking it. “Keep in mind it has to be a clear and obvious error for an on field decision to be changed.” Denmark goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel saved the Harry Kane penalty but the ball rolled back into the England striker’s path and he had the simple task of blasting the ball past the stranded goalkeeper.
