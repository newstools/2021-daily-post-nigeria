New Paris Saint-Germain signing, Sergio Ramos, has urged teammates, Kylian Mbappe, to stay at the club amid transfer interest linking him with a move to Real Madrid this summer. Mbappe has been a transfer target for Ramos’s former club, Real Madrid. But Ramos wants to play alongside the France international at PSG. “I would not dare say what someone should do, with my experience, I could give him [Mbappe] some advice in private,” Ramos told Spanish media via video press conference. Mbappe reveals why he snubbed Real Madrid move “I would like him to stay at PSG because I like to play with the best. “When you make the decision to stay or go, it is very personal.” “I don’t know what Kylian [Mbappe]has in mind, but he can make the difference,” Ramos added. “He’s very young, there is a very good team here and it needs great players. “I can bring my winning spirit and if I can pass that on to the team, it will have been a success.”
