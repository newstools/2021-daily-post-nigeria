France forward, Antoine Griezmann, has had his contract with Konami cancelled. This comes after a controversial video all the way from 2019 surfaced on social media this week. The footage, taken before a Barcelona pre-season friendly, shows Griezmann and teammate Ousmane Dembele mocking Japanese hotel staff who were fixing a TV. Both players have since released statements apologising and insisting any comments they made were not racist. However, Griezmann’s contract with the Japanese entertainment company has now been ripped up. “Konami Digital Entertainment believes, as is the philosophy of sports, that discrimination of any kind is unacceptable. “Previously we had announced Antoine Griezmann as our Yu-Gi-Oh! contents ambassador, however in light of recent events we have decided to cancel the contract. “With regard to our eFootball PES franchise, we will be requesting FC Barcelona as a club partner to explain the details of this case and its future actions,” an official statement read.
