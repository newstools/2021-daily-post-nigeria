Arsenal have agreed a deal worth up to £18million with Anderlecht for the transfer of Albert Lokonga. The two clubs have been in negotiation for weeks over the 21-year-old. But an agreement has now been reached, with Lokonga set to be given the green light to undergo his medical. Arsenal have agreed an initial £15million fee, but that amount will increase due to several add-ons that will be included in the final deal. In all, the Premier League side are expected to pay close to £18million for the young midfielder, should those add-ons and bonuses be met. It is understood that the medical will take place in Belgium, to help get the transfer finalised in as quick a time as possible. He will then travel to London, where he will have to go through a period of isolation due to COVID-19 regulations. Sergio Ramos close to joining new club as talks progress
