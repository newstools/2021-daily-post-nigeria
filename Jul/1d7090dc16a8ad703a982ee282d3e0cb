Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho, has suspended the Yoruba Nation rally which was scheduled to hold in Lagos on Saturday. Different rallies had been held in parts of South-West with that of Lagos scheduled for Saturday. However, Igboho in an interview with BBC News Pidgin on Thursday, disclosed that the rally in Lagos has been suspended. Igboho said this hours after his house in Ibadan, Oyo State, was attacked by gunmen who reportedly killed two persons and abducted his wife. He explained that he took the decision to cancel the Lagos rally because of safety and security issues. “I dey my house around 1:30am. I just hear gunshot for front of my house and shout say, we be DSS, we be soja, Sunday Igboho come out “I peep through my window, I see dem, dressed in DSS and Nigerian army uniform. I dey surprised say wetin be di problem, becos I no kill anybody. “Wetin I dey do na to fight for my pipo, my rally dey peaceful. I fight for my family (Yoruba) becos Fulani bandits kill, rape dem. Goment refuse to do di right tin, dat na why I come out,” Igboho said.
