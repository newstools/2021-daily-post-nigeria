New Roma boss, Jose Mourinho, has said Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo has no reason to fear his presence in Italy. Mourinho’s return to the Serie A means he will face his former Real Madrid player next season. The Portuguese coach was asked if Ronaldo should be worried about facing him again. But he joked that the 36-year-old is lucky he will be in the dugout and not lining up in defence. “No, because I’m not playing at centre-back. “Had I played centre-back, I’d have hit him, but unfortunately I’m not good enough and I’m too old to play against him,” Mourinho said.
