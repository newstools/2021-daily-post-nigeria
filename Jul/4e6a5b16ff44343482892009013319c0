The troops of Sector 1 Operation Hadin Kai, deployed at the Forward Operational Base (FOB) along Maiduguri-Damaturu road, have rescued 17 civilians from being kidnapped by Boko Haram terrorists in Borno. The Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. He said the terrorists had attempted to infiltrate Auno village through the Rail Line adjacent to the community but were quickly intercepted by troops in a fierce gun duel. According to him, further exploitation conducted by troops of 7 Division Garrison and 212 battalion, resulted in the successful rescue of the commuting civilians, who were abducted during the attack at Kontori along Maiduguri-Damaturu road. He said that the rescued civilians have been adequately documented and handed over to officials of Rapid Response Squad for further action. “The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.-Gen. Faruk Yahaya, commended the troops’ commitment and decisive operations against the terrorists,” he said. NSCDC gives strict warning to private guards operating in Jigawa
