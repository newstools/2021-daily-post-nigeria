He added: “They track people, they set people up, they went abroad to track Kanu with the help of another African terrorist government, but why can’t they track Boko Haram and ISWAP commanders? “We who are visible are their problem, Biafrans are not terrorists, they know us and how to get us because we are not hiding, if we are not fighting a just cause we would have been faceless like Boko Haram and ISWAP Leaders but because we have a genuine cause, we are visible and we are not afraid”. BNL said that the Federal Government are inviting trouble that they may not handle, insisting that more problems would soon befall the nation.
