The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has warned Nigerians seeking admissions into its College of Nursing to be wary of fraudsters. This became necessary after the service’s attention was drawn to a fake and fraudulent admission notification currently circulating on various social media platforms. The Director of Public Relations and Information, NAF Headquarters, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said this in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja. According to Gabkwet, the originator of the purported admission nomination into ND/HND programmes at the NAF College of Nursing (NAFCON) directs unsuspecting applicants to pay a non-refundable fee of N15,500 at the Office of the Registrar. He mentioned that the fraudster provided phone numbers, email address and a website as follows: 08123366242, 08084683594; forceeducationunit@yahoo.com; aabadmus.com.ng to deceive the public. He, however, expressed dismay that in spite of repeated warnings by the NAF, some members of the public still fall prey to the unwholesome and nefarious activities of fraudsters who swindle them of their hard-earned money for admissions that do not exist. The director assured that the service was making efforts to track and identify those fraudsters and others to bring them to justice. “The service states that currently, NAFCON has not commenced or advertised for any admission into ND or HND Nursing at the College. “Nigerians should also be informed that so far, the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), approved only the ND programme in General Nursing for the College, which is yet to be publicized,” he said. NAF urged those seeking information about admission into ND General Nursing programme at NAFCON that any update will be communicated to the general public through NAF website, www.airforce.mil.ng and other verified NAF official social media platforms. He urged members of the public to disregard any advert placement circulating on social media about admission into NAFCON.
