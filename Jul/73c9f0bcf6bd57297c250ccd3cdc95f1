New Paris Saint-Germain signing, Sergio Ramos, has vowed to help the club win many silverwares. Ramos also promised to improve the French Ligue 1 giants during his time at the club. The 35-year-old officially joined PSG on Thursday after he left Real Madrid last month. The Spanish defender signed a two-year contract with PSG that will see him remain at the club until 2023. “I am very happy to join Paris Saint-Germain,” Ramos told the club’s official website. “This’s a big change in my life, a new challenge and it is a day I will never forget. “I’m very proud to be a part of this ambitious project, to be a part of this squad with so many great players. “Paris Saint-Germain is a club that has already proven itself at the highest level. I want to continue to grow and improve in Paris and help the team to win as many trophies as possible.” Real Madrid confirm Sergio Ramos’ exit
