Argentina captain, Lionel Messi, has dedicated their Copa America win over Brazil to his family and the late Diego Maradona. Messi finally won an international trophy, after they beat the Selecao 1-0 in Sunday’s final. Angel Di Maria netted the winning goal in the 22nd minute of play. “I want to dedicate this success to my family, who have always given me the strength to continue, to my friends whom I love so much, to all the people who support us and above all to 45 million Argentinians who have suffered so much with this dreadful virus,” Messi wrote on Instagram. Argentina had refused to co-host the tournament with Colombia due to the surge in COVID-19 cases. CONMEBOL eventually transferred hosting rights to Brazil at the last minute. Messi also paid tribute to the memory of Maradona. The Argentine legend died last November at 60. “Diego was surely urging us on wherever he is,” the 34-year-old said.
