The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has busted three major interstate drug cartels supplying illicit substances to some states in the North. Operatives recovered skunk and cocaine weighing over 843 kilograms and arrested seven drug kingpins in separate operations in Benue, Kogi and Nasarawa. A statement by Femi Babafemi, NDLEA media director said in a bid to evade officers in Kogi, a cartel led by Augustine Emmanuel, 45, opted to move its consignments through the waterways between Edo and Kogi. They were intercepted on Monday, July 12 at a Jetty in Idah, Kogi. A Toyota Avalon car with reg number: Lagos SMK 345 CG, loaded with 487kg of cannabis was ferried across the waterways from Agenebode in Edo to the jetty in Idah. Babafemi said the car was seized and the ring leader apprehended. In Nasarawa, the NDLEA raided one of the most hostile drug joints in Keffi, the capital. About 356kg of cannabis and various psychotropic substances were recovered. Four dealers were arrested including the most notorious drug kingpin in Nasarawa, “Boogie” real name Muhammed Umar. Babafem disclosed that his drug distribution tentacles cut across Kano, Plateau, Benue and parts of Abuja. Also, quantities of cocaine were intercepted in Benue on 8th, 9th and 13th July.
