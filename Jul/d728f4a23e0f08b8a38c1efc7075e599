The chairman of the Southeast Governors Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, Chief David Umahi on Thursday said that Southern Nigeria can’t pretend any longer on allowing the zone to produce the President of the country come 2023 general election. The Governor made this known while addressing the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Ebonyi State chapter led by the Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Dr. Joseph Chukwu during a courtesy visit that took place at the old government house, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State. Umahi, represented by his Deputy, Barr. Eric Kelechi Igwe lamented that southern Nigeria has been marginalized, stressing the importance of allowing the zone to take over power come 2023 elections. According to him: “This country, we don’t need to pretend again. Whether you like it or not, it seems there is polarization; this one South, this one North. “The north would have done eight years by 2023 as the president, is that not correct? And some of them are saying that it will be criminal for the North to continue to be president of Nigeria after 2023. “And it is the turn of the South. And we said as Governors of the South, that Nigeria, remember that by 2023 we have it. “The North has the population by this registration that recorded us low and they said it is unconstitutional and that nobody should talk about it,” he stated.
