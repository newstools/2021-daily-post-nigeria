Akachukwu Nwankpo, governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Anambra, has selected a Pastor, Lawrence Ughammadu, as his running mate. Harris Chuma-Odili, Director General, Publicity and Strategy of the campaign made the announcement. He said Ughammadu was nominated by the party after careful considerations and deliberations within the hierarchy. Chuma-Odili described the running mate as a distinguished man of God, youth advocate, social critic and philanthropist. The spokesman said Nwankpo had an option to pick whoever he wanted but chose to involve the party in deciding who to run with. “Pastor Lawrence got the nod because he is a Pentecostal Pastor with an unblemished track record,” he noted. Ughammadu, an indigene of Nibo in Awka South Local Government Area, was born in 1973. The Pastor with Dominion City Church is an alumnus of Christ the King College Onitsha. The cleric holds a B.Sc degree in Accounting from Enugu State University, and MBA from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. 2023: ADC condemns INEC’s plan to create more polling units
