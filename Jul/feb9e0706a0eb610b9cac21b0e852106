Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has tackled the Federal Government over its refusal to release the dilapidated Ota-Abeokuta highway to him for renovation. Abiodun expalined that his administration had requested the Federal Government to release the road to him for rehabilitation. He, however, lamented that the Federal Government refused to release the road for the state, saying they wouldn’t listen. “I appealed to them (the FG) to hand over the road to us (Ogun State) for rehabilitation, but they refused and insisted they would do it. You can also see the presence of Julius Berger Construction Company at the old Toll Gate axis of this road. But we told them to come and fix these failed portions to reduce the sufferings, but they wouldn’t listen,” Abiodun stated. The governor said he would bring the Minister of Works, Babatunde Fashola to Ota in order to see things for himself. He stressed that his administration would renovate the road if the government at the centre still refuses to do the needful. DAILY POST reports that Abiodun spoke on Wednesday, when he led members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on a campaign rally to Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area. The rally is in preparation for the July 24 local government election in Ogun State. Abiodun made known his intention to reconstruct the Lagos-Sango-Abeokuta and Sango-Idiroko highways if the FG could release them to him. Hitherto, Ota people and commuters plying the Abeokuta-Ota road have been crying out to government over the worrisome state of the road. DAILY POST recalls that during the 2020 EndSARS protest, the people of Ota, in their own case, requested for a solution to the many bad roads surrounding them.
