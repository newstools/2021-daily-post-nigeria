The multi-billion naira corruption allegation against the Northeast Development Commission, NEDC, and its Managing Director, Mohammed Goni Alkali has been dismissed by some Civil Society Organisation, CSOs. The CSOs described those behind the allegation as demonic forces, making politics with the lives of Northerners. They said the NorthEast Vanguard and its cohorts are trying to distract Alkali with falsehood. A statement jointly signed by Comrade Lawrence Audu and Comrade Bassey Ukpong for the Good Governance and Advocacy Network (GGAN), said the embezzlement allegation against Alkali was based on assumption, without evidence. The CSOs noted that the North-East Vanguard decided to ignore some of the achievements of the NEDC while opting to spread falsehood. The statement reads: “Patriotic Nigerians from across the country and beyond have unceasingly drawn the attention of the leadership of the Good Governance Advocacy Network (GGAN) over the sabotaging activities of some mercantile and self-acclaimed society watch groups. “These sponsored veiled demonic forces are still politicking with the security of lives, and the ensuing peace in the Northeast region, where Boko Haram formerly occupied swathes of territories, especially in Borno state. “It is also manifest in the sustained malicious propaganda on unsubstantiated and spurious allegations of embezzlement of public funds by the Managing Director, North East Development Commission (NEDC), Alhaji Mohammed Goni Alkali.”
