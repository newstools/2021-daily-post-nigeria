Former Germany striker, Jurgen Klinsmann, has named England as the ‘favourites’ country to win Euro 2020. Klinsmann said this ahead of England’s Euro 2020 semi-final tie against Denmark on Wednesday night. According to him, England has a very good defence and scoring power. The Three Lions head to the game after eliminating Ukraine from the European Championship last weekend. Speaking to Goal, Klinsmann said: “For me, England were favourites for the title right from the start. “They have a very good defence and the mix is right, and upfront, they have that scoring power and greed to score goals.”
