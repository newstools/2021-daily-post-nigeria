Bello Mohammed Matawalle and his cabinet members to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Briefing newsmen shortly after the meeting, the Deputy Governor said the meeting became very imperative in order to rob mind with the leaders of the party across the 14 Local Government Areas of the State. DAILY POST reports that the meeting was the first official gathering of the party members since Governor Matawalle and his cabinet members dumped the party for APC. Some of the leaders of the party across the Local Government Areas said that it waz now the battle of the titans, pointing out that PDP is very much ready to take the bull by the horn. “Anybody who believes that Zamfara politics belongs to one particular political party should make a rethink because Zamfara people are now wiser,” one of them said. According to them, the defection of the Governor and his members does not make any difference, stressing that the grassroots have the voting power to decide which party forms government in 2023. They called on all the party supporters to remain committed towards uplifting the party to the next level, stressing that the party was still pursuing the mandate allegey stolen by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State.
