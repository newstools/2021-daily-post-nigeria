The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu has described the new claims made by Chidinma Ojukwu, the suspected killer of the Chief Executive Officer of Super TV, Usifo Ataga, as an “afterthought”. In a video that went viral on Monday, the undergraduate denied killing the Super TV CEO, a claim that is contrary to her initial confession. According to her, the deceased had locked the room before she left but she was surprised when she came back to find out that the room wasn’t locked. She further stated that she fled with a bag containing his credentials because she was confused on what to do as he was already dead. “I went out to get food but when I came back I noticed that someone already broke in because the door wasn’t locked. “The duvet and the pillows were on the floor, the couch was facing the door with the bed stained with blood already. “The room was already disarranged like someone broke in, then I saw him on the floor that I didn’t know what to do that was why I took my stuff and his ATM and left,” she said. Reacting, Odumosu in a statement, insisted that the police have the suspect on tape during her confession. “That is the trait of an active criminal; she was here, we recorded her. The night she was arrested, we recorded her at the state CIID, even the lady that rented the place to her, we recorded her and we have all that. If she now has an afterthought, the investigation will prove that,” he said. He also urged the public to disregard the recent interview, adding that Chidinma remained a prime suspect and whatever was said in the video would not change the facts.
