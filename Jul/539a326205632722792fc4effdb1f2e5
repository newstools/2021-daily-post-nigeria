President Muhammadu Buhari will, on Tuesday night at 8 pm, host the 109 Senators of the 9th Senate to dinner in Aso Villa, Abuja. The scheduled meeting between President Buhari and members of the upper chamber was conveyed in a letter received from the State House and read by Ahmad Lawan, the President of the Senate, during plenary. The Senate had in April reached a resolution for the leadership of the upper chamber to schedule a meeting with Buhari to enable all 109 Senators to meet with him to discuss the issue of insecurity in Nigeria. DAILY POST reports that terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, and general criminalities have been on the increase across the country lately. Residents and students of some Northern States have been the main targets of bandits, while unknown gunmen have been attacking police stations in the South region of Nigeria. The invitation letter reads, “I write to inform the Distinguished President of the Senate, that President Muhammadu Buhari will host a dinner of Senators of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on Tuesday, 13th July, 2021, at 8pm 20:00 hrs. “The venue is at the State House Banquet Hall, Presidential Villa, Abuja.”
