The Awujale of Ijebuland, Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona has approved the cancellation of the 2021 Ojude Oba festival due to COVID-19 resurgence. A statement by the Coordinator of the festival and Baagbimo of Ijebu, Chief Fassy Yusuf, announced the cancellation. Some states have recorded an upsurge in the COVID-19 Delta variant. Yet, the majority of Nigerians are still not keen on taking the vaccine, DAILY POST observed. The festival, which displays the ancient and unique cultural heritage of the Ijebus, attracts people from across the world. The organizers said it is better to avoid preventable health hazards and protect lives. In 2020, Ojude Oba festival, which takes place two days after Eid-el Kabir (Sallah), was scrapped due to the pandemic. The 2021 cancellation is the second in known history of more than a century. The Awujale, however, thanked his subjects for the peace, progress, and tranquillity of Ijebuland. The traditional ruler prayed for the return of peace to all troubled areas in the country and advised everyone to observe COVID-19 safety protocols. Born on May 10, 1934, Oba Adetona was enthroned on April 2, 1960. The member of the Anikinaiya Royal House is one of the longest reigning monarchs in Nigeria.
