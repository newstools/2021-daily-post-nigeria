Roma boss, Jose Mourinho, has advised England manager, Gareth Southgate, on team selection when they face Italy in the Euro 2020 final on Sunday night at Wembley. Mourinho urged Southgate to opt for a 4-3-3 formation in the Euro final in order to counteract Italy’s three-man midfield. The former Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur manager also wants the Three Lions coach to play Kalvin Phillips and Declan Rice in England’s midfield against Italy. Italy vs Spain: Mourinho picks country to reach Euro 2020 final Speaking to talkSPORT, Mourinho said, “I think I didn’t make many mistakes trying to predict what Gareth would do in every match. Changing the system against Germany was pure pragmatism. “They keep the back four against Denmark and looking at the way Italy play, I don’t see that changing. “The power of Italy is in the midfield. That midfield is the engine of that team. It is there that they have all the control of every game. “I don’t see any need in going to a back five. They should keep the great couple of Phillips and Rice.”
