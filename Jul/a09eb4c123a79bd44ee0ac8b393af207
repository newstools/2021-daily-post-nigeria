Novak Djokovic on Sunday, equalled Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal’s record of 20 Grand Slam titles, after he claimed his sixth Wimbledon crown on Sunday. The world number one saw off seventh seed Matteo Berrettini 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 6-4 6-3 on Centre Court. In doing so, Djokovic became the first player since Rod Laver in 1969 to win the first three titles of the year. He is also on track to emulate Laver by claiming a calendar Grand Slam. If he win the gold medal at the Olympic Games in Tokyo, he will become the first man ever to win a Golden Slam. “That was more than a battle. Congratulations to Matteo for a fantastic tournament. It was a tough match today. He’s a true Italian hammer,” said Djokovic. “Winning Wimbledon was always the biggest dream as a kid. I have to remember how special this is and not take it for granted and be aware this is a huge honour and privilege. “From being a seven-year-old constructing a Wimbledon trophy out of raw materials to standing here with a sixth trophy. It’s incredible.”
