Chelsea are set to bring Federico Chiesa from Juventus this summer. The Blues have already approached Juventus in a bid to sign Chiesa ahead of next season. According to BILD’s football chief Christian Falk, Chelsea have asked Juventus for the Italy international and placed £85.1million (€100million) as a basis for negotiation. The report added that the Serie A giants have declined talks altogether, with Chiesa seemingly not for sale. Chelsea are now expected to increase their offer in order to tempt Juventus to sell the 23-year-old forward. Chiesa was impressive for Italy during the Euro 2020 this summer. He scored two goals in Italy’s triumphant Euro 2020 run this summer. Coppa Italia: How Cristiano Ronaldo reacted after winning trophy
