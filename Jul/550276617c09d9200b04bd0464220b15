The House of Representatives has rejected the lifting of Twitter suspension in Nigeria. The rejection came on Thursday while the House was considering the report of its Committee on the issue. DAILY POST recalls that the Federal Government recently suspended the operations of Twitter in the country following allegations that it allows content capable of threatening the corporate existence of Nigeria. Despite the suspension, some Nigerians have continued to access Twitter using the Private Virtual Network, VPN. Reacting to the violation of the order, the federal government had promised to prosecute defaulters. The House of Reps had thereafter, mandated its Committees on Information, ICT, Intelligence, Justice and Orientation to investigate the circumstances of the suspension by the Federal Government. Considering the report on Thursday, Toby Okechukwu, the Deputy Minority Leader of the House, suggested an amendment to one of the recommendations. The recommendation asked that “the Federal Government take into cognizance the negative effect of the Twitter suspension on Nigerians who depend on the platform for their livelihood” and lift the suspension. Formally supported by another member, the motion was rejected by the majority of the House when put to the vote.
