The Coalition of Northern Groups, CNG, has accused the Southern governors of ganging up against the North ahead of 2023. CNG was reacting to the resolution of Southern governors on the presidency shifting from the North in 2023. On Monday, Southern governors had called for the Southern part of the country to produce Nigeria’s next president. However, CNG’s spokesman, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said the call was a gang up to deprive the North of the Presidency in 2023. Suleiman said the Southern governors’ action was undemocratic. A statement by Suleiman reads partly: “The gang up against the North, especially, to force a regional shift of the Presidency in 2023 by whatever means and tactics, including those that are clearly undemocratic. “The governors’ resolutions on 2023 exposed a deliberate attempt to impose a contentious system of rotational Presidency aimed at achieving dubious political goals to weaken the North. “This conspiracy is actively perpetrated with the connivance of some northerners and accommodated by the personal ambition of a few of those that present themselves as northern political leaders.”
