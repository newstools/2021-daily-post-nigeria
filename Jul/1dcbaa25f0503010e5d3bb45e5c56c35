He mentioned Neo, Vee as the housemates who mostly had a problem with his competitive nature and saw him as a threat. He noted that contrary to popular opinion, his reaction to when he failed a task was not a strategy but he just didn’t like to see himself fail. “I felt offended that the housemates during competitions conspired against me sometimes. “I feel they were threatened by me in the house. “I don’t care right now if they still see me as a threat though,” Prince said.
