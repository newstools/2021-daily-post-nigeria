Bill Cosby, an American actor and comedian, has finally issued a statement following his release from prison. Pennsylvania’s highest court on Wednesday ordered his release after it overturned his indecent assault conviction and ordered his release from prison. The court ruled that the prosecutor who brought the case was bound by his predecessor’s agreement not to charge Cosby. The Supreme Court found out that the testimony tainted the trial. The 83-year-old served nearly three years of a three to 10-year sentence after he was found guilty of drugging and violating Temple University sports administrator, Andrea Constand, at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. The former “Cosby Show” star took to his Twitter page appreciating his fans, supporters, and friends, insisting he is innocent of all allegations. “I have never changed my stance nor my story. I’ve always maintained my innocence. Thank you to all my fans, supporters and friends who stood by me through this ordeal. “Special thanks to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for upholding the rule of law,” Bill Cosby tweeted.
