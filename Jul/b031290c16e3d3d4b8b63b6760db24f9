President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the incessant attacks and killings being perpetrated by bandits in Zamfara, Kaduna and others States in the North. The President in a statement signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, urged the military to crush the criminals. Buhari wants the military to respond to the bandits in a language that the bandits understand. The President said the nation’s security agencies are now working on new methods and policies that are yielding good results in many of the troubled parts of the country. He “calls for a crushing response to the killing of innocent citizens in the rural communities,” the statement said. He also avers that the nation, its military and the entire population needs to summon the courage required to defeat the bandits and terrorists. The President berated politicians who, according to him, are merely seeking applause with their comments on security. Buhari advised the politicians to join the ongoing genuine efforts aimed at finding lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country. He expressed sorrow over the loss of lives, urging security agencies to do everything possible to prevent the recurrence of attacks with impunity. Recall that some politicians such as Olusegun Bamgbose had given Buhari seven days to secure the release of the 348 students held hostage by the bandits. Bamgbose said he will do everything humanly possible to ensure the release of the students if the Buhari government fails to do so in the next one week. He vowed that his group will do whatever it takes while informing the traumatized parents that their children will soon regain freedom.
