Villarreal winger, Samuel Chukwueze, is a doubt for their Europa League final against Manchester United. The Spanish club have confirmed that the Nigeria has suffered muscle damage in his left leg. Chukwueze was stretchered off in pain during their 0-0 draw at Arsenal in the semi-final second leg. A 2-1 win from the first-leg saw Villarreal advance to the final and they will play United at the PGE Arena Gdansk on May 26. No date has been set for Chukwueze’s return to action, but a club statement read: “Medical tests carried out on Samu Chukwueze have confirmed muscular damage to the quadriceps in his left leg, which he picked up during the second leg of the Uefa Europa League semi-final against Arsenal FC. It added that “the recovery time depends on the player’s progress.”
