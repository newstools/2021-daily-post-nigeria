Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has claimed Arsenal increased the pressure on his players ahead of Tuesday’s Premier League clash against Leicester City. The Blues lost 1-0 to Mikel Arteta’s men last Thursday, denting their chance to cement a top-four place. Tomorrow they face Leicester, who have already beaten them in the FA Cup final and remain ahead of them in third place on the table. “Arsenal increased the pressure for the game on Tuesday. Today was an isolated game, it has nothing to do with the race for the top 4 or the Champions League final. “Arsenal increased the pressure, unfortunately, for Tuesday not this game. This was a different competition. “If you have a group that arrives in the final, a Champions League final and arrives from ninth placed to be in the race for the top four, there’s no reason to doubt that we are not strong enough to handle the situation,” Tuchel said after the FA Cup final.
