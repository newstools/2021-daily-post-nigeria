Former Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism and Chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Niger State, Jonathan Vatsa, has advised former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar to set the records straight on the reports linking him to the supply of food and weapons to bandits in the state. Vatsa urged Gen. Abubakar not to stop at a mere press statement to exonerate himself from the said report but to address the people of the state and put the records straight. Alleging that linking the former head of state to the helicopter saga without any physical evidence was a mere distraction, Vatsa called for proper investigations to lay the matter to rest. “This rumour is over one year now, they alleged that a helicopter belonging to the former head of state, supplying food and weapons was brought down by the villagers through “black power” but up till now, nobody has shown us the picture or the crash site,” according to him. However, Vatsa, presently the Coordinator on Public Affairs to Governor Sani Bello joined the call by a Northern group, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) to demand a full-scale investigation into the report to solve the riddle on the helicopter saga. “I think the security agents have what it takes to do a thorough investigation into the matter and let Nigerians know the true situation. Linking the former head of state to a helicopter supplying weapons and food to bandits in the state without any physical evidence is a mere distraction from the reality on the ground,.” Vatsa further urged Nigerians to join hands with the relevant authority to address the security situation before it consumes the nation.
