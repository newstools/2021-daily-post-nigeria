Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment, has described the gruesome murder of the All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain and former Political Adviser to President Jonathan, Hon. Ahmed Gulak as ‘wicked, unwarranted and unnecessary.” Ngige in a statement by Mr. Charles Akpan, Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations in the ministry, said, it is not in the character of Ndigbo to shed blood for any reason and for any cause Peace, consultation and accommodation are integral to republicanism as a race. ”Ndigbo cannot afford to be linked to a senseless murder or any other action that can bitterly sour our relationship with our brothers from other parts of Nigeria.” The minister appealed to all political actors and aggrieved youths in Imo and every state in the South East to immediately halt the escalating violence and embrace dialogue. He also advises all aggrieved persons to eschew violence as there is nothing that cannot be resolved through dialogue. He, therefore, condoled the government and good people of Adamawa over this tragic loss, especially his immediate family, relatives and friends. The minister similarly condoled with the Enugu State Government and the people of Mbu in Isiuzo Local Government Area over the murder of retired Justice Stanley Nnaji of the Enugu State High Court. Ngige also prayed that God Almighty grant him eternal rest. Unions’ strike: Details of Chris Ngige’s meeting with Buhari emerge
