Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has congratulated Manchester City on their Premier League title win. City were confirmed champions following United’s 2-1 loss to Leicester City. The result left Solskjaer’s men 10 points behind their cit rivals with three games remaining. The strength in depth available to Pep Guardiola has no doubt helped in their charge to a third domestic title in four years, and Solskjaer conceded it was something United must strive towards if they are to catch their rivals next season. Asked whether having 10 players of quality on the bench is the target, Solskjaer told BT Sport: “You know if you want to take up the challenge with them of course we need to strengthen our squad. “Congratulations to them, they’ve had a fantastic season. “Very pleased with my boys, because they’ve made it into the last 10 days of the season with a Man City team ahead of us that are lauded as the best in Europe, so we’ve done well. “But we want to take the next step and it might be that we need a couple more to have a strong squad [for next season].” EPL: Guardiola reacts as Man Utd lose to Leicester, Man City confirmed champions
