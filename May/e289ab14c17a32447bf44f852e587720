President Muhammadu Buhari has described the death of the former Chief of Defence Staff, Lieutenant General Joshua Dogonyaro as a great loss to the military and Nigeria. In 1985, Dogonyaro was the officer who read the coup speech that ousted Buhari when he was a military ruler. The coup ushered in the Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida regime on August 27, 1985. But Buhari said Dogonyaro made patriotic sacrifices in defence of Nigeria’s unity and territorial integrity. “The death of Dogonyaro comes as a great shock to me because as a soldier, I know what it means to lose such an officer and a gentleman who gave his best in the service of the country,” he noted. “Laying down one’s life for the country is one of the greatest sacrifices any citizen can make to his country. General Dogonyaro’s incalculable contributions will be remembered for years to come.” The Nigerian leader extended condolences to the government and people of Plateau State on the passing of the “legendary General’’. Buhari prayed that God blesses the soul of the departed and grants his family the fortitude to bear the loss. Ayodele discloses vision about ‘coup against Buhari’
