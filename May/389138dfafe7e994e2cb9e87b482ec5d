A professor of Industrial and Marketing Management University of Calabar, Cross River State, Professor Edidiong Ebitu has said state policing is the only solution to the myriads of security challenges bedevilling Nigeria. Prof. Ebitu who made the assertion on Monday in Eket, Akwa Ibom State while speaking on the spate of insecurity and loss of lives in Nigeria argued that “the present arrangement where non-indigenes man information in different states across Nigeria would not get the country out of her security malaise.” He further argued that the personnel of state police outfits should be indigenes of the area who are conversant with every nook and crannies of the state. He said, “The personnel of the state police will be in a position to know who is a criminal in their midst and easily spot the hoodlum out. “The present arrangement where non-indigenes man police formations in different states across Nigeria does not help to track down criminals because the police officers do not know the terrain.” He called on the National Assembly to support the establishment of state police in Nigeria by passing the necessary legislation to remove policing from exclusive to the concurrent list. The Don lamented the recent unfortunate experiences of some governors who could not act swiftly to nip in the bud imminent attacks because they were not in charge of security agencies. “If we had state police, some avoidable attacks in Niger, Kaduna, Katsina, Imo, Benue and Enugu States could have been quelled beforehand. “I commend the National Assembly for their concern about insecurity in Nigeria as shown in the quality of debates and discussions on the floor of the Assembly but I feel they have the power to do more than just debate. “The panacea to this lingering criminality, insecurity and insurgency in Nigeria is the establishment of state police,” Ebitu said.
