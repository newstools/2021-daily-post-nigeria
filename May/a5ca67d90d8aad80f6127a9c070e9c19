Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has claimed N’Golo Kante was taken off as a precaution during their 2-1 win over Leicester City on Tuesday. Kante was replaced by Mateo Kovacic after only 32 minutes of the encounter. It was Kovacic’s first game since April 10 due to a hamstring injury. Tuchel is now hoping Kante is not injured ahead of their last league fixture against Aston Villa and the Champions League final against Manchester City. “I hope that N’Golo is not injured. “He told me he went out before an injury. He felt his hamstrings, he was worried that he’d get injured if he continued to play. “So we put out Kova [Kovacic] . That was a huge risk but it was the moment to take risk as it was a game of highest importance. I am happy it worked out. “Hopefully NG [Kante] will come back, we are a different team with him,” Tuchel said. UCL: Kante reveals Chelsea’s chances of eliminating Real Madrid
