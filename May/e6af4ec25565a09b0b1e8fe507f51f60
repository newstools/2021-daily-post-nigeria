Ayuba Wabba, President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, has said the abuse of power by the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai must not be allowed to go unchecked. Wabba stated this while insisting that workers have the right to embark on industrial action. Featuring on Channels Television’s Politics Today, the NLC President said the state is moving towards anarchy, if El-Rufai’s abuse of power is not checked. According to Wabba: “This is a crude abuse of power and this is an issue that we will follow up to the later because such should not be allowed to go unchecked, if not we are gravitating towards an anarchy. “Workers have a right to go on strike, all Nigerians must condemn all of this El-Rufai’s actions. There must be dignity in labour. “21,000 teachers that were sacked two years ago were not paid; of recent, 7, 000 workers comprising 2,000 local government workers, 1,700 primary healthcare agency workers from SUBEB. All of them were served letters and non of them have been paid. “These are the issue we say are the crude abuse of power. Industrial positions are very clear and it allows workers to withdraw their services and go on strike especially in this kind of situation.” El-Rufai declares NLC President, Ayuba Wabba wanted, promises ‘handsome’ reward
