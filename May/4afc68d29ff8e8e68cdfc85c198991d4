Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola has praised Thomas Tuchel and his Chelsea side for reaching the Champions League final. Guardiola also described Tuchel’s side a ‘joy to watch’. The Blues defeated Real Madrid 2-0 at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday to put a place in the Champions League final where they will meet Guardiola’s Manchester City side. But before the May 29 Champions League clash, the two teams will clash in the Premier League on Saturday. Tuchel took over from Frank Lampard after the Englishman was sacked in January and the German has made an immediate impact with Chelsea now favourites to secure a top-four finish as well as being in with a chance of winning both the Champions League and the FA Cup. Addressing the press ahead of this weekend’s clash, Guardiola hailed Tuchel’s approach since taking charge at Stamford Bridge. “First of all congratulations to Chelsea. “They put in a good performance against the kings of the competition in Real Madrid. “Chelsea has done remarkably in the last period, winning games, they play good, they have always been there every year fighting for titles in Europe, it’s not a surprise. “I have a lot of respect for Thomas. He has been in Mainz, Dortmund, PSG and now here. Every place he’s been he’s always done really well and his teams are always a joy to watch. “But to be more involved more inside, what they do, I can imagine but I have not been working with him so I don’t know [what he does]. “But the more I see, and he knows it, he’s always done really well, I am not surprised. Huge compliments for what they have done so far.”
