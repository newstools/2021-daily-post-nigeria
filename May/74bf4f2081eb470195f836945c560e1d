Manchester United have suffered four injury blows ahead of their Europa League final clash with Villarreal on May 26 in Poland. Scott McTominay and Fred sustained injuries in Man United’s 1-1 draw with Fulham on Tuesday night. McTominay went down the tunnel after he was forced off in 62 minutes against Fulham and Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, revealed Fred, who completed 90 minutes against the visitors, was injured. Solskjaer also admitted captain Harry Maguire’s chance of recovering for the Europa League final ‘doesn’t look great’, while Anthony Martial – supposedly due to featuring against Fulham – failed to make the match-day squad. “This was the end of season team selection,” Solskjaer said at his post-match press conference. “Players need minutes, some players need rest and recovery. We have had a couple of players that have got injuries with Scott and Fred, so I’ll see how they are. “Unfortunately, Scott had to come off, and Fred doesn’t look great while he’s walking now, but we’ve got eight days, so hopefully everyone will be available today. “Harry: we are working on it, but it doesn’t look great. Anthony: We’ve still got a little bit of hope for. We’re hoping.” Leicester City suffers fresh injury blow ahead of Chelsea clash at Stamford Bridge
