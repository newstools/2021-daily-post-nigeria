Arsenal has made Rennes midfielder, Eduardo Camavinga, it’s top ‘priority’ player to sign this summer transfer window. French outlet Le 10 Sport reports that Arsenal is ‘doing everything to be perfectly positioned’ for Camavinga’s signature at the end of the season. The report added that the Premier League club have placed the 18-year-old at the top of their wishlist and ‘a major operation is in the pipeline’ with regards to a high-profile move. Camavinga became the youngest player to ever represent Rennes when he made his first-team debut against Angers in April 2019 at the age of 16 years and four months old. The France youngster has gone on to establish himself as a regular player for the French Ligue 1 club. He has also been linked with a move to PSG, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester United in the past. Camavinga’s current contract with Rennes will expire in 2022. Rennes may be tempted to cash in on Camavinga this summer as they risk losing the player on a free transfer in around 12 months’ time.
