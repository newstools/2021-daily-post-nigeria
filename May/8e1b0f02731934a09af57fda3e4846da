Shuaibu Ibrahim, Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has said that the scheme is “critical to the unity of the country”. Ibrahim made this known while reacting to the bill seeking to scrap the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC. DAILY POST had reported that the bill seeking to repeal the NYSC scheme is set for second reading at the House of Representatives. The bill was sponsored by the lawmaker representing the Andoni-Opobo/Nkoro Federal Constituency of Rivers State, Awaji-Inombek Abiante Also, some concerned Nigerians slammed the National Assembly for allowing the bill to pass through its first reading citing its numerous benefits to Nigerians, particularly the youths. However, the DG during an interview with newsmen on Wednesday in his office in Abuja, said the scheme is not a waste of time. According to him, ” Its relevance in integration and national cohesion must not be underestimated.” He said NYSC has been a useful tool for the socio-economic development of the country through the deployment of corps members to states outside their base. “NYSC is not a waste of time, wherever corps members are posted to, they have been adding value in order to be remembered with good legacies,” Ibrahim said.
