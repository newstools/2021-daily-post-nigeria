The Daura Emirate Council has announced the suspension of Sallah Durbar, horse parade for the forthcoming Eid-el Fitr celebration within its territory. This was disclosed in a circular addressed to district heads, signed by Danejin Daura, Alhaji Abdulmimini Sahihu on behalf of the Daura Emir, Dr Umar Faruk Umar. The Emir further directed his subjects to organize special prayers within their domains to pray for the peace of the nation instead. The Royal Father also gave directives that he would not be entertaining courtesy calls from the district heads during the festive season. “The Emir instructed me to inform you that, due to the insecurity in the country, kidnappings for ransom and other threats to national stability, the usual Sallah Durbar will not hold this Eid-el-Fitr. “You are by this notice to inform all the imams to pray for President Muhammadu Buhari (Bayajida II) and other leaders for protection from all evils of the enemies of progress of this country, its stability and its corporate existence,” Meanwhile, preparations were already in top gear in the Katsina Emirate Council under His Royal Highness, Alhaji Abdulmunini Kabir Usman for the conduct of traditional durbar for the forthcoming Eid el-Fitr as expressed in a letter sent to all district heads within its emirate last month. “I am directed by the Emir of Katsina, His Royal Highness Alhaji Abdulmunini Kabir Usman to inform you that whoever is willing to participate in the upcoming durbar for Eid el Fitr should write and inform the emirate council. “All those concerned should note that they are to convey the above information to the council on or before 20th of Ramadan which is equivalent to 2nd of May, 2021.” Due to the prevalent insecurity situation in the state both Katsina and Daura Emirate have not been observing the traditional durbar celebration since 2019.
