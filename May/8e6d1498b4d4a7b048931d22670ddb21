Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has said the squad is in need of an overhaul. The Catalans finished third in LaLiga behind champions Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid. Captain Lionel Messi is yet to agree a new contract, but Koeman feels the club needs to support their superstar with quality additions. “When we arrived we took the template that was available. “[Sergino] Dest only came on the last day. For me this squad is not made to have the level that it demands and that we want for Barcelona. “There are older players with all due respect. And there are young players who have to gain more experience to be better. The project is not done, in one season you can not do everything,” Koeman said following the 1-0 win at Eibar on the final day.
