The immediate past manager of Chelsea, Frank Lampard, has expressed his gratitude to his successor, Thomas Tuchel, over his remarks praising his work in the first half of the 2020/2021 season. Tuchel replaced Lampard in January and has led the Blues to the finals of the FA Cup and Champions League. The former PSG boss has also all but sealed a top-four finish in the Premier League. But he gave credit to the foundation Lampard laid, as the reason why he is thriving. In reaction, Lampard said today: “I appreciated his (Tuchel’s) words last week. “I was pleased to hear them because I think it’s right. I’m not just giving myself credit. But if I was in his shoes I would certainly speak like that so he’s giving me credit for the first half of the season. “He’s taken it on and I’ll give him credit for that as well because to reach two finals and to be in contention for the top four, I know that battle from last year, we were in it last year and it’s tough battle, especially in the run-in.” NECO releases 2020 SSCE external results, blacklists four supervisors for abetting malpractice
