A former Vice Presidential candidate of the National Action Alliance (NAA), Justice Ughuegbu, says Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma should handle the insecurity in the State with care. The legal practitioner advised Uzodinma to embrace dialogue in tackling the challenge. Ughuegbu spoke to reporters in an interview in Owerri, the state capital. The politician urged stakeholders to come together to proffer solutions to the lingering crisis. According to Ughuegbu, now is not the time to use political affiliations as an excuse. “We have come to a point where the state government must embrace dialogue and consult with notable stakeholders who will proffer viable solutions. “Our leaders must stop being silent, they must now speak up before this situation engulfs us all.” He regretted that Imo, hitherto, a safe place, had been bedeviled by insecurity. Ughuegbu, however, appealed to youths to resist being used to perpetrate crimes. Imo attacks: ‘Banditry is here’ – Ohanaeze heaps blames on Gov. Uzodinma
