Stoke City manager. Michael O’Neill has hailed John Mikel Obi as “a brilliant signing”. O’Neill’s men finished the 2020/2021 EFL Championship season with a 2-0 win at Bournemouth. Mikel Obi made his 39th league appearance in the game and played from the start, as they ended their six-game winless run. The 34-year-old signed for the Potters on a short-term deal last August and O’Neill have now expressed satisfaction with his contributions. When asked about the Nigerian midfielder’s performance, O’Neill told Stoke on TrentLive: “Brilliant. I thought he was brilliant. The [control and the] pass he plays for Rabbi Matondo in the first half too. “I’ve just said to him in the dressing room that I hope we can get that player on loan from Chelsea again next season. Today I thought he looked every bit. “You can see with performances like that why he was at Chelsea for such a length of time in his career. He’s been a top player who has won everything in the game. “He’s been a brilliant signing. When we’re compact as a team we get the best of John. He’s very positive around the club, a lot of help for the young players and I’m delighted to have him.” Before signing with the Potters as a free agent, Mikel terminated his contract with Turkish Super Lig club Trabzonspor during the coronavirus pandemic in March last year.
