Manchester City striker, Sergio Aguero, broke Wayne Rooney’s record for most Premier League goals scored for one club on his last appearance at the Etihad. Pep Guardiola left Aguero on the bench for the visit of Everton, with the Argentine set to leave City after 10 years. He was introduced into the game in the second half and scored twice as the champions won 2-0. Rooney managed 183 goals during his 13 years at Old Trafford and Aguero’s first goal meant he drew level with the England legend. Aguero ensured that he broke the record with a second. In all, he netted 258 times in 388 games for City. Aguero is expected to join Barcelona on a free transfer this summer, with the Catalans set to offer the forward a two-year deal.
