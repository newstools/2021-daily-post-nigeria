Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has said that his forward, Timo Werner works like a dog while praising the German his ‘relentless’ display in the Blues’ 2-1 victory over Manchester City on Saturday. England international, Raheem Sterling gave Man City the lead in the first-half while Sergio Aguero squandered a golden opportunity to make 2-0 from spot kick before half time. Thomas Tuchel’s Blues returned stronger in the second half, equalised through Hakim Ziyech and Werner then provided Chelsea with the winning goal as his low cross was fired in by Marcos Alonso. Asked if the Germany international needs to add patience to his game, Tuchel told Sky Sports, “Yeah, but it’s easier said than done because he was working like a dog. “He was really, really working hard up front. It was so important, he gave them a hard time with all these runs. Once he had chances he had them pretty exhausted, so no complaints “In the last week he’s really adapted well to the situations.” Champions League: Timo Werner sets two records as Chelsea eliminates Real Madrid
