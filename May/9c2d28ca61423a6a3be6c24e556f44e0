The leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has revealed that the grievances of Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State will cause problems in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Primate Ayodele warned that Wike is interested in dominating PDP. The clergyman, in a statement he forwarded to DAILY POST, urged the opposition party to address these grievances before it gets out of hand. According to Ayodele: “Governor Wike is angry, he wants to dominate PDP, and his grievances will cause serious problems in the PDP. There is work to be done for the party; let the leaders address these issues.” The clergyman also cautioned the PDP’s reconciliation team to be wary of what he termed “Judas.” “Saraki reconciliation team is very good if only the party can allow it to flow well, some Judas are still working against that reconciliation, PDP should be watchful against backstabbers,” he said. On the All Progressives Congress (APC) reconciliation members, Primate Ayodele said: “APC reconciliation team are fantastic, they want to do everything for the party to move forward but some people don’t like the chairman of the party and this will draw the efforts backward”.
