A 52-year-old man, Kayode Adeniyi of 12 Abere Ifa street, Ijoko, Ogun State, is currently in police net over alleged defilement. The Ogun police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST that the man had confessed that he had serially defiled his three underaged daughters before he did same to a 10-year-old girl. The suspect’s arrest followed a report lodged at the Agbado divisional headquarters by an aunt of the 10-year-old victim. The aunt told the police that when her niece went to the apartment of the suspect to ask whether his daughter was the person who mistakenly removed the clothes she spread outside, he had forcefully dragged her into the room, covered her mouth with a pillow and had sexual intercourse with her. According to Oyeyemi, the complainant explained further that the suspect threatened to kill her with a knife should she make noise. DAILY POST learnt that Adebiyi was nabbed as the DPO of Agbado division, CSP Kehinde Kuranga, detailed his detectives to the scene. “On interrogation, the suspect confessed having carnal knowledge of the victim forcefully, he also admitted that he threatened the victim with a knife and that is why she can’t make noise until he satisfied his sexual urge. “Further investigation into the past activities of the suspect revealed that he had been sexually abusing his three underaged biological daughters before now, which he also did not deny. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police Edward Ajogun, has ordered the family support unit of Sango Area Command to take over the case for an in-depth investigation and diligent prosecution.”
