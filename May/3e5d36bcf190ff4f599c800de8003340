The Kaduna State Government on Sunday said media reports of an attack on Jaji Military Base are false. This was contained in a statement on Sunday. The statement which was signed by Mr. Samuel Aruwan, Commissioner, Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Kaduna State, said “The Kaduna State Government wishes to debunk a publication circulated by some online media outlets detailing an attack by armed bandits on the Jaji Military Base, Igabi LGA on Saturday 29th May 2021. “According to the report, armed bandits attacked the base and gunned down several soldiers,” the statement read. “The military and security agencies have reported to the Kaduna State Government that there was no such attack and all personnel stationed at the base are safe and accounted for.” The statement further said that, “the Kaduna State Government therefore strongly debunks the false and grossly misleading publication, and urges the public to disregard the fake news.” Gunmen kidnap family of five in Ondo
