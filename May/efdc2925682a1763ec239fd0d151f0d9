Chelsea striker, Timo Werner, on Wednesday night set two records following his side’s Champions League semi-final second-leg 2-0 victory against Real Madrid at Stamford Bridge. Werner’s first-half goal and Mason Mount’s second-half strike ensured Chelsea qualified for the Champions League final ahead of Real Madrid. Chelsea eliminated Real Madrid from the Champions League on a 3-1 aggregate win, having played a 1-1 draw with Zinedine Zidane’s men in the first-leg last week. Thomas Tuchel’s side will now face Premier League rivals Manchester City in the Champions League final on May 29. However, according to OptaJose, Werner’s goal against Real Madrid means the 25-year-old is now the first German player in the Champions League history to score against the Los Blancos for a non-German club. Also, the Chelsea number 11 is now the first German to score a headed goal against Real Madrid in the Champions League since at least 2003/04. Werner will now hope to continue his impressive display for Chelsea when they tackle Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday at Etihad.
