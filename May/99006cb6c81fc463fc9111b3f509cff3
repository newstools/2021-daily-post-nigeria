The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo State has accused Governor Hope Uzodinma-led government of using the military to harass, intimidate and cause fear among the citizens of the State. The party, in a press release signed by its state Publicity Secretary, Ogubundu Nwadike said the presence of armed military men was causing serious tension in the State, describing the situation as unbearable. According to the release, the state records series of unwarranted deaths as a result of sporadic shootings which, it argued may not be far from the military men. It expressed worry that if the military men are left to operate in the State, the people will be made vulnerable to attacks and brutalization which, it stressed, may cause more loss of lives in the State. It called on Traditional Rulers, the clergies, Imo leaders and all men of goodwill in the State, to rise up to the occasion before it is too late. In the same vein, it urged the Governor to ensure that the security agencies operating in the State are professional in their actions and are conversant with the tenets of democracy. The opposition party further urged all Imo residents to remain calm and law-abiding, praying God to protect all in this trying period.
