The Osun State Government have been called upon to see the need to quickly conduct elections or constitute caretaker committees at the local government level as elective positions at the third tier of government cannot continue to remain vacant. This call was made by Adekanola Desmond Abiodun, a member of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State in a chat with DAILY POST. Adekanola stated that since the local government is the closest to the people, the manner the government appointed council managers are managing the affairs of their councils calls for sober reflection. According to him, “It is over three months now that the tenure of the local government chairmen in the state came to an end and the governor is still finding it difficult to constitute a caretaker committee and conduct an election.” He alleged that the way the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration in the state has managed the local government portrays they are not democratic enough which has prevented dividend of democracy from getting to the grassroots. Reacting, the spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun, Kunle Oyatomi declared that the PDP has no experience and expertise in handling elections at the local government levels, adding that their experience was woeful. He maintained that the ruling party owed PDP no explanation as to why elections have not been conducted at the local government level. According to Oyatomi, “We cannot be prompted by the PDP. They are not qualified to tell the APC how to run government. We do what the people want us to do and not what the PDP wants. We listen to the advice of the people. “Everything is a process and the administration at the local government is not disturbed in any way. “No one is saying there is no administration at the local government council areas. At the appropriate time, we will conduct the local government election,” he concluded.
