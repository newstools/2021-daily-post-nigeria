Aston Villa captain, Jack Grealish, has chosen to play for Manchester City. According to the Athletic, the England international wants to Aston Villa in the summer transfer window and Man City is his number one choice. The 25-year-old has a desire to work with Man City manager, Pep Guardiola and would prefer a move to Etihad instead of Manchester United. Grealish has been linked with a move to Man City and Man United this summer. The 25-year-old midfielder was a target for Man United last summer but he ended up signing a new long-term deal at Aston Villa after the Red Devils refused to meet Villa’s £75million asking price. Grealish led Aston Villa to finish in the 11th position on the Premier League table this season. Man City will have to battle Man United for Grealish’s signature.
