More details have emerged about the abduction of a Chief Superintendent of Customs, Mba Ukweni Edu, in Cross River State. A villager, Okon Etim, revealed that Edu was abducted mid-sea close to Ugbem, adding that the kidnappers have demanded a N100m ransom. Etim explained that the victim was snatched from a vessel conveying goods and whisked away in their speedboat. “The suspected kidnappers drove their speedboat close to the ponting, shot sporadically, hijacked the victim and pushed him into their speedboat and sped off,” he said. “He is a Chief Superintendent of Customs. The ferry point is between Etono-Central and Ugbem in Biase LGA. He was kidnapped while they were on the water, close to Ugbem,” he added. He called on security agencies to secure the release of their son as his alleged kidnappers do not know the pains the people and community were passing through.
