Manchester United is keeping players’ movement top secret, to ensure the rearranged fixture with Liverpool goes ahead, ESPN reports. The club is concerned the team bus may be blocked in a bid to stop the players arriving at Old Trafford and forcing the match to be postponed for a second time. Security meetings have been scaled back, to make sure only a few club employees know the whereabouts of the squad ahead of Thursday’s clash. The use of decoy buses outside different hotels has also been discussed. The original fixture on May 2 was cancelled after supporters protesting against the Glazer family broke into the stadium. A smaller group of supporters also surrounded the team hotel, blocking roads and exits to prevent the bus from leaving. United have a longstanding relationship with the Lowry Hotel in Salford, three miles from Old Trafford, to host the players and staff before home games although the squad were not seen arriving before the 2-1 defeat to Leicester City on Tuesday.
