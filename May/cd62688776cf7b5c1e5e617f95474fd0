The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of tactically siding with Palestine, a country at war with Israel. Daramola Joseph, the National Secretary, in a statement Monday night warned Buhari against dragging Nigeria to join the Arab world to fight Israel. The scribe referred to the comment by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey wherein he sought Nigeria’s support for Palestine. In a rejoinder sent to DAILY POST, the Christian leadership declared that Nigeria is a secular state and not a Muslim nation. “We are worried that Nigeria which was wrongly labelled an Islamic State because of her unlawful membership of the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) has been taking side with the Palestinians since the emergence of President Muhammadu Buhari. “On behalf of every Nigerian Christian, we call on the Federal government to reverse itself on the support that has been given to the Palestinians to date. “For the record, millions of Nigerian Christians are in support of Israel against the position of the government. We once again remind the Federal government and the National Assembly that Nigeria is not an Islamic State.” CAN called on the International community to intervene in the ongoing bloody actions in the Middle East without bias if they truly wanted an enduring peace. The body agreed with the United States of America that Israel has the right to defend herself against external aggression. “We see no reason why Nigeria should take side with either of the warring factions”, the statement added.
