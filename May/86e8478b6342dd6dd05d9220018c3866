Former Chelsea defender, Ashley Cole, has claimed that Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea team have fallen back into bad habits after their FA Cup final 1-0 defeat to Leicester City on Saturday. Leicester City defeated Chelsea at Wembley Stadium to win their first FA Cup trophy thanks to Youri Tielemans’s only goal of the match. Speaking on BBC Match of the Day after the game, Cole claimed that Chelsea’s recent displays under Tuchel have “felt the same” as some of their displays under former Blues manager, Frank Lampard. He said, “Chelsea have 3 cup finals now basically if they want to finish in the top 4 and win the Champions League. “They have got to pick themselves up and go again. They cannot feel sorry for themselves. “Is it the same team as Frank Lampard’s? “When Frank was here they controlled and dominated games but couldn’t finish it off. “The last couple of weeks, it has felt the same.”
