Fasting and prayers, according to the leadership of the Adamawa State chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalists NUJ), are the surest ways of ensuring the immediate release of the kidnapped female journalists, Amrah Ahmed Diska. To actualize this sole objective, it said there is need for all members of the profession to embark on fasting and prayers. The said female journalist, whom DAILY POST reports is a nursing mother, was abducted by unknown gunmen last Tuesday at Mbamba in Yola South Local Government Council. The abducted journalist who is also a News Editor with Adamawa Broadcasting Corporation(ABC) Yola, was said to have fell prey on resumption of office from her maternity leave. As at the time of filing this report, her captives, as gathered by Daily Post, have established contacts with the family demanding for ransom, the amount which is yet to be ascertained by our correspondent. In a statement on Thursday made available to media practitioners by the leadership of the council via its Secretary, Fidelis Jonathan, the need for journalists to seek for divine intervention for her safe release can no longer be overemphasized. The gunmen who were said to have stormed her residence came in large numbers, according to DAILY POST findings. They gained access to her bedroom through the sitting room before disappearing with her. The abductors whom our correspondent learnt went for the husband of the journalists but met his absence, decided to kidnap the wife, leaving behind her newly born baby. Some colleagues who also bared their minds on the issue, beckoned on both the state and federal governments to wade in by ensuring that she regains her freedom from the kidnappersâ€™ den unhurt.
