Former Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Erica Nlewedim has likened her stay in the Big Brother house to being in prison. Erica said her stay in the house was very stressful because she was conscious of the cameras. Speaking during a podcast, the reality television star regretted showing somebody a particular side of her in the house. According to her, she protects herself in the outside world but couldn’t do that in the house because it was like a prison. ‘I said What I said’. It is not easy to be constantly conscious of cameras every time. “Obviously, one knows that cameras are there but one can’t be acting or trying to be on one’s best behaviour all the time. It is very stressful. One can do it for the first two weeks but at some point, one would get tired of it. “Some people changed but I was just the same. This is how I am. I show myself the way I am. “Sometimes, I felt I shouldn’t have shown a particular person a particular side of me but I consoled myself with the thought that we would soon be out of there. I protect myself in the real world but in that world (BBN), it was more like a prison.” “Men are intimidated by my success” – Erica reveals why she’s single
