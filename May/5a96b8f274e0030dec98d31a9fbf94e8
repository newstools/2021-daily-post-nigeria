Paris Saint-Germain are set to launch a clearout of their squad following their failure to reach the UEFA Champions League final this season. PSG was eliminated from the Champions League semi-final second-leg tie against Manchester City on Tuesday. The French Ligue 1 champions were knocked out by Man City in a 4-1 aggregate defeat, having lost both legs 2-1 and 2-0. According to French outlet, Le Parisien, Striker Mauro Icardi will be among the players put up for sale by PSG, with midfielder Pablo Sarabia and defender Thilo Kehrer also to be made available. Another player whose futures are uncertain is Mitchel Bakker and Rafinha Alcantara. The report added that PSG wants to reduce their wage bill this summer after the club was hit hard financially by the COVID-19 pandemic and are expected to record losses of €300million this season. The decisions have been accelerated by PSG’s disappointing elimination from the Champions League this week. PSG are currently in the second position on the Ligue 1 table behind leaders Lille.
