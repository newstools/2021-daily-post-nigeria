Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has accused former Governor of Niger State, Babangida Aliyu, of being a mole in the Peoples Democratic Party. The Governor made the accusation on Monday, during a media chat at the Government House, Port Harcourt. According to a statement issued by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri; Governor Wike described as unfortunate, the continued membership of Aliyu of the highest decision making body of the party, despite his “confession” of working against the reelection of former president Goodluck Jonathan in 2015. He said while other governors were working assiduously for the success of the party in the next general election, Aliyu is allegedly working as a spy for the All Progressives Congress, APC. The statement said “Aliyu Babangida is a mole in PDP. These are people who get information and in the night they go to the ruling party (APC) and give them the information.” Governor Wike also dismissed insinuations that he has a frosty relationship with the National Chairman of the opposition party, Uche Secondus , saying a mere disagreement on issues does not translate to a frosty relationship. According to the statement, “The same Aliyu in 2017 was one of those who opposed Secondus to be chairman of the party. He only came on board at the dying minute when he knew Secondus was coasting to victory.” The governor’s outburst was in reaction to comments by the former Niger State governor, that some of the opposition being faced by Secondus is from Rivers State.
