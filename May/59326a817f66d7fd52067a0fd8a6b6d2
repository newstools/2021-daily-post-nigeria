Real Madrid winger, Eden Hazard, is being linked with a move to AS Roma in the forthcoming summer transfer window. According to the Italian news outlet, Leggo, Hazard is being eyed by Jose Mourinho, who is looking to make him his first Roma signing. Mourinho is plotting a reunion with Hazard, having managed him at Stamford Bridge for two years. The Portuguese gaffer is likely to be given funds by the Giallorossi when he takes charge at Roma next season in his first year back in Italy since 2010. A £43million offer could be enough to tempt Real Madrid into accepting the deal, with Hazard failing to live up to his £130million price tag. The Belgium international is one of a number of players that have been put up for sale by Real Madrid this summer following another underwhelming season in the LaLiga. Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez, is ready to sanction winger Hazard’s exit from the club amid interest from Chelsea. Hazard wants to leave Real Madrid this summer and is reportedly eyeing a return to Chelsea. His current contract with Real Madrid will expire in 2024.
