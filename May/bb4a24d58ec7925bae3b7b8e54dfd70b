Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said both N’Golo Kante and Edouard Mendy are on course to be fit for their Champions League final clash with Manchester City this weekend. Kante picked up a hamstring issue against Leicester City, while goalkeeper Mendy came off at half-time against Aston Villa on Sunday with a rib problem. Speaking about Kante in a pre-final press conference on Monday, Tuchel said: “He looks good and I hope he stays like that. “We will just put him in training when the game starts on Saturday and not speak to doctors and physios or changing tactics. Sounds good to me.” Mendy, who was replaced by Kepa Arrizabalaga at Villa Park, is set to be back in training on Wednesday. “The update is we still have hope he joins training on Wednesday and the group. “He made a huge improvement with the management of pain. So we need a further update on Wednesday but we hope to have him back,” Tuchel added. EPL: Tuchel names Chelsea player to skip international break
