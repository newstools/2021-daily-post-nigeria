Real Madrid forward, Eden Hazard, has apologised to the club’s supporters after their Champions League defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. Chelsea defeated Real Madrid 3-1 on aggregate in the semi-finals of the competition, and the Belgian put up a very poor performance. Hazard, who left Stamford Bridge in 2018 was even seen talking and laughing with some Chelsea players after the disappointing night. He was criticised for his action by fans and was even slammed by s number of former Real Madrid players while Spanish television show El Chiringuito opened its programme by criticising the Belgium international. The television claimed the Belgium captain had ‘taken the piss’ out of fans. But , addressing the outrage, Hazard said on Instagram: “I am sorry. I have read lots of opinions about me today and it was not my intention to offend the Real Madrid fans. “It has always been my dream to play for Real Madrid and I came here to win. The season is not over and together we must not battle for La Liga! Hala Madrid!”
