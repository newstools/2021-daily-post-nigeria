Arsenal have been put on red alert, with Manchester City putting up Raheem Sterling and Riyad Mahrez for sale this summer, Daily Mail reports. City manager, Pep Guardiola, is already working on tweaking his squad ahead of next season, after winning a third Premier League title in four years. Sterling and Mahrez have both contributed 14 goals apiece in all competitions in 2020/2021, but are deemed surplus to requirements and could be sold for the right price. Gunners boss, Mikel Arteta, has registered a strong interest in the two players, after working with them during his three-year spell as Guardiola’s assistant. However, Arsenal’s financial situation and failure to qualify for Europe next season, might prove a major stumbling block in their attempts to land either player. It’s claimed Gabriel Jesus and Aymeric Laporte could also be let go, with City willing to pull out all the stops to fund potential moves for the likes of Harry Kane, Erling Haaland and Jack Grealish.
