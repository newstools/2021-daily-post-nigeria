Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said he wants to sign a prolific striker ahead of next season. The Premier League champions are believed to have narrowed their choices to Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane and Erling Haaland of Borussia Dortmund. A striker is top of Guardiola’s wishlist this summer, with Sergio Aguero leaving the club. Guardiola, speaking ahead of their final home game of the season against Everton, admitted he wants a front man who can get him up to 50 goals a season. “I’d love to have a striker who got 50 goals a season, honestly. “At the same time, I don’t like to put all the pressure on one player. “In Barcelona, Lionel Messi, every season since he was born, scored 50 a season. “Thierry Henry scored a lot in the first season and Samuel Eto’o scored a lot – what a striker,” Guardiola said.
