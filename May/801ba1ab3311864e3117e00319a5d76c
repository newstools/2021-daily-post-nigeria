The Biafra Nations League, BNL, has claimed that the Cross Rivers State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade was forced out of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, by his Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike. DAILY POST reported earlier on Thursday that Ayade dumped the PDP for the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ayade’s CPS, Christian Ita confirmed the development to DAILY POST. He said the Governor made his defection known during a meeting with six APC governors who visited him at the Government House. Ayade said he was joining the APC, due to the attributes of President Muhammadu Buhari and the realisation that Cross River, which has been emasculated economically following the ceding of its oil wells, needed to be in sync with the party at the center. And Deputy National Leader of BNL and Head of Operations of BBs TV, Ebuta Akor Takon, in a statement to DAILY POST, said Nigeria politicians have always been known for their cross-carpeting. BNL said that Wike has been parading himself as the boss in the South-South and also in his party, and blamed Ayade’s decision to leave the PDP on Wike’s attitude. “He[Wike] believes everything is politics. He was interfering in Cross River State political affairs. “He has insulted every Governor in the South-South believing everything should be all about Rivers State. “He was a boy yesterday, but brought up by Chibuike Amaechi, but now he has grown wings.” Cross River: 6,000 appointees moving to APC with Ayade as Deputy Speaker dumps PDP
