The Catholic Bishop of Ekiti Diocese, Most Rev. Felix Femi Ajakaye, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari, to address Nigerians on the challenges confronting the nation. Bishop Ajakaye said what is happening in Nigeria now calls for concerns, especially the issues of kidnapping, killings, banditry and should be addressed by the President himself and not his aides. The Bishop called on President Buhari to command the nation very well, asking him “what legacy would he leave behind when his tenure is over”? Bishop Ajakaye, made this remarks during the weekend at St. Patrick’s Catholic Cathedral in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State capital, during the 55th World Communication Day, where many journalists were in attendance at the Mass. The theme of the day: “Come and See”, Communicating by Encountering People Where and as They Are”, the message of His Holiness Pope Francis, for the 2021 World Communications Day. Bishop Ajakaye, urged media people, journalists to go beyond the “complacent attitude that we “already know” certain things. He said: “As journalists, we need to practice journalism, media of integrity and credibility, saying there is no room for Armchair Journalism where a journalist bases his report or presentation on mere speculation without making thorough and necessary investigation. Armchair journalism portends danger. “All of us are responsible for the communication we make, for the information we share, for the control that we can exert over fake news by exposing it. All of us are to be witnesses of the truth: to go, to see and to share.” Govt’s failure to address insecurity affecting Nigeria’s investment opportunities – Atiku Abubakar
