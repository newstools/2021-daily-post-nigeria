British former professional boxer, David Haye has predicted an early knockout when Anthony Joshua takes on Tyson Fury in August. Haye said he is expecting Joshua to secure a knockout early in the fight. The showdown has been fixed for August 14 in Saudi Arabia, when a unified heavyweight champion will be crowned. Nigerian-British boxer will present his WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles to the party, while Fury will come with his WBC and Ring Magazine belts. Fury, the unbeaten Gypsy King, has been tipped by many to claim the day, but Haye feels Joshua will pull off the upset in spectacular style. “I like the dedication of Joshua and I think he has a good chance of winning it early,” Haye told the Press Association. “People think I’m crazy but that’s just the way I see it. I loved his fight against Wladimir Klitschko. “I think it’s a great fight and I really see it being won by stoppage. “Tyson isn’t so much of a one-punch specialist. He puts his punches together and his style is that if you throw big looping shots at him he’ll make you look silly. “But AJ throws hard, compact punches and he puts them together well. I don’t see this fight going smoothly for Fury at all.”
WBC Champion, Fury, had earlier boasted he will knock out AJ inside three rounds. Fury said this after Joshua defeated Bulgarian fighter, Kubrat Pulev. Joshua knocked out Pulev in round nine at the Wembley Arena in London after a dramatic and entertaining affair to set up a possible clash with Fury. Joshua on his part had vowed to break Tyson Fury’s head ahead of the fight. Joshua was reacting to Fury’s earlier social media taunt.
