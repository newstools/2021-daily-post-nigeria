Former Chelsea coach, Antonio Conte is reportedly set for a return to the Premier League. Tottenham Hotspur are said to have offered the Italian a huge salary in a bid to try and convince him to leave Inter Milan this summer, according to La Stampa. Despite leading the Nerazzurri to the Serie A title this season, it is believed the 51-year-old had become disillusioned with the club’s financial situation. With Inter not looking likely to invest in the team before next season, Conte could be forced to depart. Although Spurs finished in seventh position last season, Chairman Daniel Levy has proposed a contract offer worth as much as £17 million-a-year. That would dwarf the £11m-a-year salary Conte is on in Italy. Tottenham are also under no pressure to sell players and have promised significant investment in recruitment, so the Italian coach can shape the squad how he sees fit. Although Spurs will be playing in the Europa Conference League next season, while Inter are in the Champions League, Conte feels Tottenham have put forward a convincing proposal.
