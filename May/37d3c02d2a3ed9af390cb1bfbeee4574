Former Cameroon striker, Samuel Eto’o, has predicted his former club Chelsea to win Saturday’s Champions League final against Manchester City. Eto’o, who featured for the Blues in the 2013/2014 season, is delighted that Thomas Tuchel’s side has qualified for their first Champions League final since 2012. Although City is considered overwhelming favourites for the game, Eto’o feels Chelsea have every chance of leaving the city of Porto as European champions. “I am happy to see my old club Chelsea qualify for the Champions League final once again,” Eto’o told Goal. “For some, Manchester City is the favourites to lift the trophy, but in my opinion when it comes to a final, there is no such thing as favourites. It is just one game, so anything is possible. “Time and time again, we have seen teams arrive to a final unfancied,” he added, “only to leave as champions.” Champions League: Salah equals Eto’o’s goals record
