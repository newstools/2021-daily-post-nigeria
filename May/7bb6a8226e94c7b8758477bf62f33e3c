About 20 military officers have died in three crashes in the last three months. On February 21, a Minna-bound military jet crashed, killing all 7 people on board. On April 2, another NAF jet crashed in Borno. The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) called for an investigation of the mishaps. “No military anywhere in the world should pretend that it is okay to record plane crashes on bi-monthly bases, and no country or people can accept that. “We demand the result of earlier investigations published and a military Committee of Enquiry empanelled to investigate the incessant crashes”, said the President, Solomon Adodo.
