The Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, says there will be no war in Nigeria despite agitations in some quarters. The monarch spoke at the Second Quarterly Meeting of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) in Abuja. The Sultan, regarded as the leader of Muslims in Nigeria, is the Co-chairman of NIREC. “People have been talking about war; there will not be war in Nigeria, who is going to fight who?”, he quipped. He said in families, there are Christians and Muslims, as well as many ethnic nationalities.
Abubakar noted that those making “noises” were only trying to draw attention to what they can get out of Nigeria. “There are excellent people that mean well for the common man and humanity, and that is what God created us to do.” The Sultan appealed to Nigerians to “continue to sit together and dialogue.” “If you know you can bring peace without fighting war, then why do you have to take up arms?”, he further queried. Abubakar stressed that peace is the most important aspect of life and must never be under threat. Unite against terrorism, kidnapping, banditry – Buhari tells religious leaders
