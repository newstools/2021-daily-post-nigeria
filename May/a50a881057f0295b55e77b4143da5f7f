Peter Timothy Igbifa, President of Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) has been kidnapped. Men with covered faces, suspected to be Secret Service operatives, seized Igbifa on Tuesday. Igbifa’s whereabouts remain unknown amid growing fears among the youths and his family. The Department of State Services (DSS) has denied involvement in the alleged abduction. DSS spokesperson, Peter Afunanya distanced the agency from the incident. “The DSS has nothing to do with the alleged arrest or whisking away of IYC President, Comrade Peter Timothy Igbifa by suspected masked men,” he told PRNigeria. The disappearance of the Igbifa has been linked to a protest slated for Abuja, Nigeria’s capital. The IYC had issued a one-week ultimatum to the federal government to reconstitute the board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). Igbifa told all staff of multinational oil companies in the South-South to vacate the region until the board of NDDC is inaugurated.
