The Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Yusuf Tuggar has lauded the German government for its support to Africa towards the restitution of stolen and illegally trafficked cultural properties. Tuggar in a press statement said Germany was re-connecting Africa with its history and addressing some of the most pressing issues of the time. ‘He said: ‘We are said to be living today in the Anthropocene age. Human activity has become the dominant force of change. These items do not stand in isolation. All parties stand to gain from the restitution of Africa’s looted cultural properties. “Restitution would spell the re-uniting of the Mind with the Body, of African Culture with African Nature. And this is the key to addressing the existential problems of the Anthropocene age: the degradation of our environment and diminishing bio-diversity.” The former lawmaker said the understanding of pre-colonial Africa’s relationship with nature, can provide some answers to climate change, conservation and sustainable development. He said it offers a glimpse of an era where consumption was based more on ‘need’ than ‘want’, with minimum waste and maximum efficiency. “Africa’s cultural heritage is a portal to learn about the past, in the present, to save the future. But that portal is best accessed where the heritage was created, Tuggar explained.
