Real Madrid boss, Zinedine Zidane, has advised his players to have the ball, play and enjoy themselves when they face Chelsea in tonight’s Champions League semi-final second-leg tie at Stamford Bridge. Zidane’s men had played a 1-1 draw with Chelsea in the first-leg encounter in Spain last week. Real Madrid head to the game after defeating Osasuna 2-0 in the LaLiga last Saturday. The Los Blancos are currently in the second position on the LaLiga table with two points behind leaders Atletico Madrid. “Very aggressive [on Wednesday night] because they are used to that… very aggressive,” Zidane was caught saying to his players by El Chiringuito’s cameras. “And then remember to have the ball, play… play and enjoy [yourselves] with the ball because that’s what got us here. Real Madrid is and has always been about this.”
