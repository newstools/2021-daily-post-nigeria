The Governor of Borno State, Babagana Zulum, has said the late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, was committed to the fight against Boko Haram. Zulum stated this as he paid tributes to Attahiru and 10 other Military officers, who were buried in Abuja on Saturday. He said Attahiru was determined to significantly contribute to ending the insurgency. “The commitment of the late chief of army staff to the fight against Boko Haram was very obvious. Within the short time he served, he had been to Borno on multiple occasions, meeting operational commanders and troops at battlefronts. “In all his interactions, he regularly motivated troops. The people of Borno thank him and all our gallant fallen heroes for their unquantifiable service to Borno and the rest of Nigeria,” Zulum said in a statement. Attahiru died in a plane crash close to the Kaduna Airport on Friday. 10 other officers were also killed when the Beachcraft 350 aircraft came down due to bad weather.
