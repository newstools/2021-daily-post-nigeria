Olusegun Bamgbose, National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance (CAGG), has described the six years of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration as that of pain and disaster for Nigeria. Yesterday, May 29, 2021 marked the sixth year Buhari has been at the helm of affairs of Nigeria. And Bamgbose said that the current administration has made Nigerians poorer and more insecure, adding that Buhari has scored below average. “There are two basic reasons why Nigerians voted for him in 2015. Nigerians thought that as a former military general, he will be able to tackle the issue of insecurity confronting Nigeria,” Bamgbose told DAILY POST on Sunday. “However, Nigerians missed it because insecurity has become worse in recent times. The insecurity has now engulfed the whole nation as opposed to what we had before he came on board. “The other reason why Nigerians decided to try Buhari was the issue of corruption. It was widely believed that Buhari will summarily put an end to corruption in Nigeria. Nigerians got it wrong in this area also. “The corruption level has risen astronomically under Buhari’s administration. One won’t be far from being wrong to assert that almost 35% of our national budget is looted every year. This is so sad. “Contracts are awarded and money embezzled. Nigeria is surely in pain. Buhari’s reelection is highly regrettable. The unity of Nigeria has never been as weak as we have it presently. “The economy has not equally fared well under Buhari. Democracy has been held hostage. Hardship has become our closest neighbor. “We are in pain. One just has to pray hard to survive another two years of Buhari’s administration.” Insecurity: Civil war may break out in Nigeria – Bamgbose warns Buhari
