The Kano State Fire Service says 12 lives were lost, and property worth N17.6 million were destroyed in fire incidents recorded in the state in April. Saminu Abdullahi, Public Relations Officer of the Service, gave the figures in a statement on Tuesday in Kano. He, however, said that scores of lives and property worth N423 million were saved within the period under review. “The Service responded to 73 rescue calls and 14 false alarms from residents of the state,” he added. Abdullahi attributed most of the fire incidents to road accidents, careless handling of cooking gas and the use of inferior electrical appliances. He advised residents to always drive with caution and handle fire with care to prevent outbreaks.
