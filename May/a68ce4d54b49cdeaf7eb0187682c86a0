Fulham became the third club to be relegated from the Premier League. This follows their 2-0 defeat to Burnley on Monday night. Scott Parker’s men needed to avoid losing to hold on to their faint hopes of staying up. However, Ashley Woodward and Chris Wood scored for Burnley to seal Fulham’s fate. Just on Sunday, West Brom were also relegated, thanks to a 3-1 defeat at Arsenal. Sheffield United’s drop into the Championship was confirmed weeks ago. Norwich City and Watford have also taken up two spots in the Premier League ahead of the 2021/2022 season.
