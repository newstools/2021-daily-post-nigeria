The Lagos State police command has said it’s unaware of the reported bail granted to embattled Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju James Omiyinka, popularly known as Baba Ijesha. Recall that the legal team of the ace comedian had on Monday evening announced that Baba Ijesha had been granted bail on health condition. His lawyer, Adesina Ogunlana, who made this known also noted that they were yet to perfect his bail. However, while reacting to the reports, the spokesperson to the police in Lagos, Muyiwa Adejobi, during an interview with newsmen, said the command did not receive such notice. “We just saw reports that he has been granted bail. Well, I am not aware of the bail and the command has not received any notice based on the issue. “I am not aware and it is not in my knowledge,” he said. No allegation of rape made against Baba Ijesha – Police frown at ‘newspaper trail’
