Nigeria forces have apprehended Awurum Eze, the deputy to Ikonso Don, the late commander of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) controlled Eastern Security Network (ESN). Director of Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima, made the announcement in a statement Wednesday night. Ikonso and six others were eliminated three weeks ago. Other ESN members were nabbed in a joint operation by government operatives. The spokesman said Eze, 48, is a native of Umoneke Nta, Isiala-Mbano Local Government Area of Imo State. On May 4, 2021, he escaped when operatives of Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT) stormed his village house in Isiala Mbano. Eze was eventually apprehended on May 12, in Aba, Abia State, after weeks of unrelenting follow-ups by operatives. “Awurum Eze is one of the main sponsors of the numerous killings in Imo State and has been on the wanted list of security agents for more than 3 months. Many of the arrested IPOB/ESN terrorists had earlier mentioned him as their key sponsor, mastermind and Second in Command to late Ikonso. “According to them, amongst all their leaders in Imo State, only Ikonso and Awurum have direct communication link with Nnamdi Kanu. He can be seen in several photographs posing with the fugitive terrorist leader, Nnamdi Kanu,” the statement read. An investigation to apprehend more ESN members across the South-East is ongoing.
