Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has vowed to resist any attempt by politicians from Abuja to impose anybody as next governor in the state. He spoke at a special thanksgiving church service on Sunday to mark the second anniversary of his administration’s second tenure at St Paul’s Cathedral, Diobu, Port Harcourt, the state capital. In a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, the governor said: “Let me say it again, I have never sat with anybody to say I will make you governor. “But, as a governor, nobody from anywhere, be it in the party, in Abuja, will impose who will be the candidate of PDP in Rivers state. “Nobody can impose a candidate here in this state. So, if you are running to Abuja, you are wasting your time.” Governor Nyesom Wike imposes curfew across Rivers State
