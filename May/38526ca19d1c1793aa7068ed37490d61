The Biafra Nations League, BNL has warned that the shoot at sight order against Biafran groups recently issued by the Acting Inspector General of Police, IGP, Alkali Baba will force its members into full-scale violence. The Acting Inspector-General gave the order when he visited Enugu and the Rivers State, Port Harcourt, recently. The group warned against the order being carried out, in a statement signed by its leader, Princewill Chimezie Richard on Thursday. BNL warned that the Federal Government was trying to provoke the Biafran agitators to embark on violence that will result in a declaration of a state of emergency. “FG wants to destabilize the region by ordering the police to shoot at sight,” the group said, adding that “should the Biafran secessionists start operating like the Boko Haram it would be worst than what the government is experiencing in Sambisa forest. “We will not watch the security agencies clamp down on us, the unknown gunmen are sponsored by politicians for political reasons and have nothing to do with Biafra.” Princewill warned that “there will be a high increase in violence should the Federal Government start extrajudicial killings of Biafran agitators and their supporters in the South East and South.” BNL insisted that the upcoming Biafra memorial day will be observed.
