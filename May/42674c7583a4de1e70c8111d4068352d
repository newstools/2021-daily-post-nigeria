Real Madrid midfielder, Eden Hazard, has said that he was ‘very disappointed’ by manager Zinedine Zidane’s departure from the club. Hazard said he regrets not performing better for Zidane following his exit from the Santiago Bernabeu. Zidane stepped down from his role as Real Madrid manager for the second time in his coaching career a few days ago. The Frenchman failed to win a trophy during the 2020-2021 season. “Zidane’s departure? I am very disappointed,” Hazard said at a Belgium press conference ahead of Euro 2020. “Individually I have not been able to give him what I have in me and that is disappointing, with all those injuries. “That was difficult. But he knows I value him highly both in terms of player and coach. “I had two wonderful years with him and I would like to thank him for that, although I feel frustrated that I have not been able to offer him more, but hopefully that can change in the future.” Sir Alex Ferguson slams idea of Super League, speaks on Man Utd’s involvement
