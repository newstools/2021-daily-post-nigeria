Tottenham Hotspur chairman, Daniel Levy, will demand a world-record fee to sanction Harry Kane’s departure to a Premier League rival this summer, the UK Independent reports. Kane has told the North London side he wants to leave ahead of next season. The 27-year-old has vowed to sit down with Levy to have a frank conversation about his future. Levy is one of the shrewdest negotiators in world football and it had been suggested that it would take around £150m to prise Kane away from Spurs. However, it is understood that Levy has since increased the asking price and will only consider selling the England captain for a world record fee of over £200m. Such a move would eclipse the £199.5m PSG paid Barcelona for Neymar in 2017. It is unlikely that any English club would consider paying such a fee for Kane, given his history of injury problems and he will only have two years to run on his Tottenham deal in 2022.
