The Commissioner of Police, Ebonyi State Command, CP Aliyu Garba, at the weekend denied fresh killings of Ebonyi citizens by suspected herdsmen. DAILY POST gathered that herders in their number allegedly invaded Odike village in Ebonyi LGA of Ebonyi State, killing residents while scores sustained serious machete cuts in their heads and other parts of their bodies. But, the Commissioner of Police in a statement signed and forwarded to DAILY POST by the Police spokesperson, Loveth Odah in Abakaliki, the state capital, said, “The attention of the Ebonyi State Police Command has been drawn to the pictures/news items in circulation on some social media platforms misleading the reading public that a village in Ebonyi local government area of Ebonyi state was under herdsmen attack. “To set the records straight, the information reaching the command has it that the attack happened at Nwori Ndobasi and Odoke village In Ado local government area of Benue and not in Ebonyi State as widely reported on social media platforms and other conventional media outlets, though the area is said to be dominated by Izzi and Ezza language speaking indigenes of Ebonyi State.” CP Garba however charged the general public to disregard the news of an attack and go about their lawful businesses as the Command has placed adequate security measures to ensure the safety of lives and property.
