Manchester United playmaker, Bruno Fernandes, has claimed he would have won the Ballon d’Or prize already, if he had the pace of teammate Marcus Rashford. Fernandes has been one of the Premier League’s top performers this season. This term alone, the Portugal international has scored 18 times and provided 11 assists in the league. He also won back-to-back Premier League player of the month awards in November and December. But one attribute Fernandes would love to have that he is lacking is speed and the midfielder is envious of Rashford’s pace. “I think I’m not the slowest player in the world but if I would have the pace of Rashy, honestly, I would be a Ballon d’Or [winner] already,” he replied to a supporter on the club’s official website. “With the pace he has, oh my God, he’s unbelievable. “It’s incredible the way he is and, when I talk about pace, it’s about running with the ball and without the ball, and, at the same time, the pace in his feet. “The quality he has, the moves he has and the agility he has to come away from difficult situations. It’s unbelievable.” Champions League: Mbappe tipped to win Ballon d’Or award
