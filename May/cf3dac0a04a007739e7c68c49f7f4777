Leicester City has suffered a major injury blow ahead of their Premier League clash against Chelsea on Tuesday night. Leicester manager, Brendan Rodgers, confirmed he would be without Jonny Evans when they tackle Chelsea at Stamford Bridge due to a heel injury. Evans sustained the injury during Leicester City’s FA Cup final victory against Chelsea over the weekend. “He [Evans] won’t play in the game [against Chelsea]. He will struggle for that,” Rodgers told reporters at his pre-match press conference on Monday. “We’ll see what he’s like for the weekend.” He added, “Nothing to report at the moment. It’s only the second day after the game so we’ll see how they are after we get them moving. “They are in the Champions League final for a reason. They have got an excellent squad. “We have to work hard and be equally aggressive and see if we can make our chances count.” Leicester is currently in the third position on the Premier League table with 66 points from 36 games, while Chelsea is fourth with 64 points from the same number of matches.
