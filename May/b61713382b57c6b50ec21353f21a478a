Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has labelled their next Premier League clash with Crystal Palace as a final. The Reds go into the game looking to secure Champions League football on the final day of the season. On Wednesday night, the former champions went above Leicester City into third place with a 3-0 win at Burnley. “It was a semi-final. We had to win the semi-final and we did that. 3-0. Clean sheet,” Klopp told Sky Sports. “Nothing is decided yet, but we improved our position, slightly, and we have the ‘final’. “So that’s what we wanted, that’s what we needed and it’s what the boys deserved today because it was a top, top performance.” Man Utd vs Burnley: Cavani asked me to bench him – Solskjaer
