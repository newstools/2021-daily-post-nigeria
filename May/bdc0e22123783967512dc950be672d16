The Police Command in Imo State says its men killed four hoodlums who allegedly attacked the Izombe Police Division in Oguta Local Government Area of the state on Saturday night. The Commissioner of Police in Imo, CP Abutu Yaro, disclosed this in a statement signed by the command’s Spokesman, SP Bala Elkana on Sunday. Yaro explained that many of the hoodlums fled with bullet wounds. Recall that the attack came less than 24 hours after gunmen razed the Atta police station in Njaba council area. However, just unlike the Atta incident, four of the hoodlums were killed in a gun duel with security agents. Yaro said the latest incident took place between 7 pm and 10 pm on Saturday in Izombe. The CP said, “The hoodlums in their numbers launched an offensive on the Izombe police station but were repelled by the gallant policemen on duty. “Four hoodlums were neutralised during the attack while others escaped with bullet wounds.“ Yaro said that a mop-up operation was ongoing to arrest fleeing members of the gang.
