Former President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, on Saturday said she was disheartened over the suspension of Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) Hadiza Bala Usman. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari on May 7th approved a probe of the management of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA). The probe, recommended by the Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi demanded an Administrative Panel of Inquiry to look into the activities of the NPA. Buhari also ordered Hadiza Bala Usman to step aside while the investigation is on. She is alleged to have looted over N165 billion. But reacting, Sirleaf on her Twitter page said Hadiza is an accomplished leader and dedicated public servant. Sirleaf called for equal treatment and adherence to the rule of law during the probe. ”I am disheartened to hear about the suspension of Nigerian Ports Authority MD @hadizabalausman, who I have known to be an accomplished leader and dedicated public servant. ”I urge adherence to the rule of law and fair and equal treatment as the situation evolves.”  NPA: PDP demands sack of Rotimi Amaechi, prosecution of Hadiza Usman
