The Senate has adjourned plenary until May 18, 2021, to enable members to observe the Sallah celebrations. The Senate President, Mr Ahmad Lawan, announced this after a closed-door session with Service Chiefs, which lasted for about 4 hours on Thursday. Lawan, however, disclosed that before that date, “we expect that our committees will still be working, particularly the Joint Committee working on the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB). “We expect that the joint committee will be presenting its report to the Senate as soon as we resume. “It’s still our desire and determination to pass the PIB before the end of May.” On the Electoral Act amendment Bill, Lawan disclosed that the Senate Committee on INEC would still have to do some little work. “Other committees, particularly again, our committee on Constitution Review headed by Dep. Senate President, has designed zonal interactions with our constituents, Nigerians. “We also expect that they’ll be able to complete their work as soon as possible for the Senate and House of Representatives to vote on the issues and, of course, send our report to the 36 State Houses of Assembly. “I am sure that during our recess, between now and May 18, we’ll still be doing one form of legislative intervention or the other, either as individuals or maybe as groups. “We’ll continue to be available for our constituents.”
