The people of Anambra say they want competent governance and adequate dividends of democracy in the state. Hundreds of women and youths made the call at a meeting with an All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant, Hon. Azuka Okwuosa. They expressed displeasure with the state politics, adding that rancor among prominent individuals was affecting the government. One of their leaders, Mrs Perpetual Anosike, lamented the level of insecurity in Anambra. “Roads are getting worse by the day; working conditions of civil servants have seen no substantial improvement. “The State Government has not made independent efforts to repress the effects of the hardship on Anambra and the masses,” she rued. The gathering declared that the days of allegiance to one party or particular politicians are over. The indigenes announced that they are willing to support any candidate who can administer good leadership. Another leader, Mrs. Ijeoma Nwaemeka, wished Okwuosa well in his ambition and urged him to continue grassroot mobilization.
