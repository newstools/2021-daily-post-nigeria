Arsenal legend, Ian Wright, has said it would be ‘harsh’ for Liverpool to miss out on next season’s Champions League. The former champions beat Burnley 3-0 on Wednesday night to go above Leicester City into third place. The race for the top four will go down to the last day, but Chelsea and Liverpool are now firmly in the driving seats with their destiny in their own hands. Leicester will simply have to win their game and hope for other results to go their way. If the Foxes beat Tottenham and Chelsea fail to beat Aston Villa at Villa Park, there is a chance both Leicester and Liverpool could finish in the top four while the Blues slip to fifth. Wright feels it would be cruel on Liverpool to miss out on top four, given the huge amount of injuries they have had to deal with this campaign. He told Premier League Productions: “I feel sorry for Liverpool with everything that has happened. “With the injuries and everything that has happened to them. “With the way they blasted the league last year after missing out by a point the year before. Then they get to a situation where they are decimated with injuries. Their front three stop firing. Wright continued: “Then they find it at the end to get something. “For them to have a demise, not even get into Champions League for everything they have done the last couple of years then I think it will be very harsh on them.” Man City vs Chelsea: Ian Wright predicts team to win Champions League title
