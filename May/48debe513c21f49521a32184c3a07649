Manager of Chelsea’s women’s team has said they lost the Champions League final against Barcelona Femeni because of inexperience. According to her, the game was “over before it began”. Chelsea were stunned inside a minute when Melanie Leupolz inadvertently sent the ball looping into her own net, before giving away a penalty shortly after. Barcelona eventually won 4-0 to clinch the trophy for the first time. Hayes told BT Sport: “Congratulations to Barcelona, they’re worthy winners, deserving of the title and it’s something we will learn from because this is the next step. We showed some naivety at times. “They were favourites for a reason and you have to stay in the game against this team. The early goal and the manner in which we conceded it. It’s an own goal and a penalty and we’re 2-0. “I felt calm coming into the game but I think some of the inexperience cost us. But they will grow and improve from that. They’re all really proud of the shift they put in. “We have won the double so we’re not trophyless, but I’m gutted we didn’t get the chance to actually make a game of it. I did my best, I tried to coach the players and change a few things, just to give us a little bit of momentum.”
