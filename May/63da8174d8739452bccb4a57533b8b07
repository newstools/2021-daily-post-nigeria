A newborn abandoned by the bush was yesterday rescued in Moferere area of Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital. The baby girl, which still had a placenta attached to her umbilical cord and fresh blood all over her body was believed to have been dumped in the area by the mother. A source said the baby who was without clothes, was tied in polythene back before she was discovered and rescued by a young man passing through the area around 8 am on Tuesday. He said, “The man, who is about 20years old and some residents of the area immediately took the infant to a nearby private hospital for medical attention. “The baby, wrapped in a polythene bag was discovered by a bush beside an uncompleted building by passers-by including the young man who brought it to the hospital”. The management of the hospital contacted the police and the state ministry of women affairs on the matter. One of the staff of the hospital who craved anonymity said the baby is in good condition adding that residents of the area have been donating clothes for her. An official of the state ministry of women affairs and a policewoman later took the infant away from the hospital. Reacting to the development, some residents of the area condemned the action of the supposed mother of the child, describing it as wickedness on her part. Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti State Command, Mr Sunday Abutu said the attention of the police was drawn to the issue of the abandoned baby around 8 am today. Abutu who posited that the baby must have been dumped at the place late on Monday evening, however, said a team of operatives led by the divisional police officer of the area and officers of the ministry of women affair rescued her and took her to the hospital. Abutu said efforts are on to identify the mother of the abandoned infant.
