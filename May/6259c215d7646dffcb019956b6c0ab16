Liverpool ace, Mohamed Salah, has congratulated Tottenham Hotspur striker, Harry Kane, for winning this year’s Premier League Golden Boot. Salah insisted that the England captain deserved the award this season. The former Chelsea star missed out on the Premier League Golden Boot after Kane scored on the Premier League last day of the season against Leicester City. Both Salah and Kane went into the last games of the season on Sunday level on 22 goals. But Kane grabbed his 23rd in the first half of their 4-2 victory against Leicester City. The pair both missed out to Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy last season. “Very well deserved! Congratulations!” the 28-year-old wrote on Twitter in response to Kane’s own celebratory post.
