The International Criminal Court (ICC), has sentenced a former commander of the notorious Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) militia, Dominic Ongwen, to 25 years in prison for atrocities in Uganda. Ongwen had already been found guilty in February of 61 counts for war crimes and crimes against humanity which includes murder, mutilation, sexual violence and the use of child soldiers. However, the presiding judge, Bertram Schmitt from Germany on Thursday said the sentence reflects the gravity of the crimes. Schmitt said the court considered it a mitigating circumstance that Ongwen himself was not only a perpetrator but also a victim of the LRA. “He had been abducted as a nine-year-old on his way to school and used as a child soldier. “He had suffered greatly in the early years but that did not justify the horrific crimes he had knowingly committed as an adult. “He committed some of the crimes in private, sometimes sexual crimes in the complete privacy of his sleeping place. “In view of these circumstances, it is impossible to think that he could have committed his acts under any threats,’ the judge said. NAN reports that Ongwen was also responsible for four attacks on refugee camps from 2002 to 2004. He was one of the deputies of LRA chief, Joseph Kony, who is still a fugitive.
