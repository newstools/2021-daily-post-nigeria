Nigerian Government has declared Wednesday 12th and Thursday 13th May, 2021 as Public Holidays to mark 2021 Eidul-Fitr celebration. The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, disclosed this in Abuja, while congratulating Muslims on this occasion. Aregbesola urged Nigerians, at home and abroad to use this year’s Eidul-Fitr celebration to pray for peace, stability and economic transformation in the nation. Aregbesola admonished all Nigerians to be law-abiding and embrace the spirit of love, self-discipline, kindness and tolerance, as taught by the Holy Prophet Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Him). The minister also called on all security agencies in Nigeria to be more courageous and patriotic to surmount the ongoing battle against resurging insecurity and activities of criminal elements in the nation. He assured that the resolve of President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to end the scourge of crime and criminality and restore peace to every nook and cranny of Nigeria was sacrosanct. “This administration will not be deterred in its efforts, until every Nigerian and resident of the country, is free to move around without fear of any threat to his/her life and property.” He added that the government is employing all necessary measures and strategies to strengthen the country’s stability and ensure economic prosperity of Nigeria.
