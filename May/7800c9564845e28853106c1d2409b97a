The Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions, on Tuesday, gave the Chairman, Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) Mr Danladi Umar, two weeks to defend a petition against him. NAN reports that the Chairman of the Committee, Sen. Ayo Akinyelure, issued the directive when Umar appeared before the committee in Abuja to answer allegations of assault by a security guard, Mr Clement Sagwak. Sagwak a security guard had through his Counsel, Timzing Ramnap, petitioned the Senate, accusing Umar of assault. He told the Senate in his petition that he was assaulted by Umar and a policeman attached to him after he informed him (Umar) that his car was not properly parked. He said the CCT boss slapped him several times and forced him to kneel down in the presence of people while performing his lawful duties. Following the development, Umar, after he appeared before the committee asked to be given one week to study the petition and respond appropriately. In a response, Akinyelure said even though the Senate would proceed on a two-week break on Thursday, the Committee will reconvene during the break to hear the respondent, Umar. Recall that a viral five-minute video had captured Umar and the guard having an altercation at the Banex Plaza, in Abuja. Umar, however, denied the allegations, claiming he was a victim of an assault by people who chanted “secessionist and sectional slogans”.
