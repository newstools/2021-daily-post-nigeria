Barcelona President, Joan Laporta, has decided on the manager to replace the club’s current coach, Ronald Koeman. According to Spanish radio station RAC1, Laporta has spoken to Bayern Munich boss, Hansi Flick, with regard to becoming Barcelona’s next manager. Laporta found Flick ‘receptive’ and liked the ‘methodology and the intensity’ he would bring to the Barcelona squad. He sees Flick as his first choice to replace Koeman at Camp Nou if the Dutchman was sacked. Koeman is currently under intense pressure at Barcelona, having won just one of their last five La Liga games. He also saw his side crash out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage last February following a 5-2 aggregate defeat to Paris Saint-Germain. Barcelona’s draw with Levante and then defeat at home to Celta Vigo ended their hopes of LaLiga title success this season. Barcelona can finish the LaLiga season no higher than the third position and could even drop to fourth place if they lose to Eibar this weekend. Meanwhile, Flick has an agreement to become the next Germany manager after Joachim Low leaves his role as national team coach after this summer’s European Championships.
