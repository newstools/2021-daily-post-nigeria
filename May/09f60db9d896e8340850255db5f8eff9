A final check has confirmed that a total of seven Toyota Hilux vans belonging to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were burnt down in the Sunday night attack on their facility in Anambra State. The commission’s collation centre and store containing over 50 generating sets and other equipment were also burnt down. Anambra State police commissioner, CP Chris Owolabi who led journalists to inspect the affected facility said the police registered over 90 percent success in combating the attackers. DAILY POST had earlier reported that three Hilux vans used by the attackers were abandoned after police operatives matched them with greater firepower. Owolabi addressing journalists said, “The hoodlums first went to “B” division police station and were repelled, then they came to INEC and our men repelled them too. “I can tell you that we recorded about 95 percent success. There were no casualties on the part of the police. I want to appeal to journalists to report carefully because we read where people reported that scores of policemen were killed. “Since last night, we have been moving from hospital to hospital, because we are sure some of the attackers escaped with serious wounds. We are appealing to hospital management to help us track them. “I want to plead with Anambra people to go about their legal activities.” Eight riffles consisting of AK-47 and pump action were recovered from the attackers, including live ammunitions and items of clothing and berets.
