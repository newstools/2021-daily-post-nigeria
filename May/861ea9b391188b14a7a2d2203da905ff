Abdulrasheed Bawa, the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, says the anti-graft agency has recovered $153 million from Diezani Alison-Madueke, ex-Minister of Petroleum Resources. Bawa also said the EFCC recovered the final forfeiture of over 80 properties in Nigeria valued at about $80 million from Alison-Madueke, who has been living in the United Kingdom, UK, since leaving office some years ago. He explained that the EFCC is looking forward to having the former Minister in the country, to face trial, given that she was out of Nigeria’s jurisdiction. This was contained in the April edition of the commission magazine, EFCC Alert. “There are several issues surrounding Diezani’s case. I was part of that investigation, and we have done quite a lot. In one of the cases, we recovered $153 million; we have secured the final forfeiture of over 80 properties in Nigeria valued at about $80 million. We have done quite a bit on that. “The other cases as it relates to the $115 million INEC bribery is also ongoing across the federation. We are looking forward to the time we will, maybe, have her in the country and, of course, review things and see what will happen going forward. The case has certainly not been abandoned,’’ Bawa said. Recall that the Federal High Court in Abuja had fixed May 17 for the EFCC to report on how it complied with the court order in the trial of Alison-Madueke. The EFCC had accused Alison-Madueke of fleeing the country to the UK, to escape justice, among others. EFCC targets corrupt assets in UAE, UK, reminds bankers of June 1 plan
