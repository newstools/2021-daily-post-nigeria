Following the deteriorating security situation in the country, a former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has declared his stance on a call for self-defence, vowing that it’s better to die in the war against the insurgents than to bow as a coward. DAILY POST reports that some concerned Nigerians have recently urged citizens to devise means of defending themselves during attacks. Recall that the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom had several times urged President Muhammadu Buhari to license arm for citizens to defend themselves when they are made vulnerable by the attackers. Similarly, the human rights lawyer has declared that Nigerians will not go down without a fight saying, “We would rather die than bow to their tyranny”. Fani-Kayode made the declaration on Tuesday morning in a series of tweets on his verified Twitter handle. According to Fani-Kayode, no authority can stop Nigerians from protecting and defending themselves, stressing that those with the constitutional responsibility to do so has failed. The tweets read: “We seek peace & not war but hear this. We will NOT go down without a fight. We will NOT vanish into the night. “If those that are charged by the Constitution to defend & protect us refuse to do so, no force on earth or in hell can stop us from protecting & defending ourselves. “We will NOT allow these accursed foreign invaders and barbaric terrorists that have plagued and blighted our land to impose their will and have their way. “We will NOT be anybody’s ritual sacrifice. We will NOT go down quietly like lambs to the slaughter. “We will NOT be meek& mild& allow ourselves to be liquidated, exterminated, subjugated or enslaved. “We will resist the evil that seeks to wipe us off the face of the earth with all the might, strength& power that God has given to us. We would rather die than bow to their tyranny”.
