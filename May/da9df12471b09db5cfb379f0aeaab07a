After spending five days in kidnappersâ€™ den, the abducted Council Chairman of Yagba West Local Government Area in Kogi State, Hon. Pius Kolawole has finally regained his freedom from his abductors. DAILY POST recalls that Kolawole was abducted on Saturday evening while returning from Ilorin, Kwara State. A Pension Commissioner in Kogi State, Solomon Akeweje was not that lucky during the incident as he was shot dead by the unknown gunmen in his vehicle at Eruku some few kilometers to Egbe in Kogi State. DAILY POST gathered that both late Akeweje and the Yagba West council boss were in the same vehicle when the incident occurred. Confirming the release of the council boss, a family source who spoke with our correspondent on Wednesday evening, said Kolawole was welcomed and received by jubilant supporters and family members in his hometown, Egbe. It was, however, not clear if a ransom was paid to secure his release as his abductors had earlier demanded for N100m. According to the family source, the Council Chairman is hale and hearty and has reunited with his family and teaming supporters. Efforts to reach the Kogi State Police Command to confirm his release proved difficult as of the time of filing this report.
