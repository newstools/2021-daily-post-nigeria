Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has insisted that Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City would not have won the Premier League title this season if their three centre-halves were injured. Klopp disclosed this during his pre-match press conference ahead of Liverpool’s Premier League final day fixture against Crystal Palace on Sunday. Liverpool were without defender Virgil van Dijk for the majority of the campaign with a ruptured cruciate ligament, while Joe Gomez was sidelined shortly afterwards with a knee injury before Joel Matip became the third long-term absentee at centre back. “So a football team is like an orchestra where plenty of people work together, and if you lose one piece, you might be able to still do it, but if you lose two, then it becomes difficult,” Klopp told Sky Sports. “It’s how I said before this year, with the number of injuries we’ve had it was not the year to become champions. No chance. For nobody. “As good as they are, if [Manchester] City have their three centre-halves out, no [they don’t win the league]. Three centre-halves of United, no. For the whole season, pretty much too, that is how it is. “We have fought back a bit, accepted the difficulties and made the best of it, and if we win on Sunday, and if we qualify for the Champions League, then we made the best of it. That is it.” Klopp’s side are currently sitting in the fourth position on the Premier League table ahead of their season final tie with Crystal Palace.
