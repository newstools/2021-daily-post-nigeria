Steve Bould has been sacked as Arsenal’s U-23 coach, Goal reports. The 58-year-old’s departure is believed to be the start of a big summer shake-up at the Emirates. Bould has been with the Gunners for 30 years and replaced Freddie Ljunberg in 2019 in the role. He has now been fired following a difficult season for the U23s. Bould has also been followed out of the door by Performance Coach, Bruno Mazziotti. Mazziotti only joined Arsenal last year from Paris Saint-Germain. However, the Brazilian signed a one-year deal, which will not be renewed.
