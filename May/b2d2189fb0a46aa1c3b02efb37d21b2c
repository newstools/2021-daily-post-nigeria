Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa, is yet to make his Nigeria Professional Football League return. Musa was not in Ibrahim Musa’s squad, as they played out a 1-1 draw against Warri Wolves. The winger joined Pillars on April 13 for a second stint at the club. Musa had been a free agent since he left Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr on October 25, 2020. The former Leicester City and CSKA Moscow star returned to Sai Masu Gida after agreeing on a short-term contract with the NPFL side. Many Nigerian fans had expected him to feature against the Seasiders, but to their disappointment, the 28-year-old did not feature for the crunch encounter.
