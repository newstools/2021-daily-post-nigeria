President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has labeled the attacks on security agent, mostly in South-East and South-South States, “a declaration of war”. Lai Mohammed, Information Minister blew in hot in a statement issued to the media on Tuesday. “Whether known or unknown gunmen, those engaged in this dastardly act will pay dearly for their actions”, he stressed. Mohammed said assault against operatives of the military, the police, customs and other security agencies was unacceptable. “Attack on our security men and women is an attack on the state and a declaration of war against the nation”, he warned. The official announced that the actions of enemies of the state will be countered with “overwhelming force.)”. He said when those with responsibility to protect Nigerians are being subjected to mindless attacks, it can only be “to instill fear and evoke a sense of pervasive insecurity”.
