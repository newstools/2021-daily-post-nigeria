United States President Joe Biden on Wednesday told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he expected de-escalation in the face-off with Palestine. Biden and Netanyahu spoke on the phone on the situation in Gaza and Israel’s position. The White House revealed they discussed Israel’s progress in degrading the capabilities of Hamas and other terror organizations. The leaders also deliberated on the ongoing diplomatic efforts by regional governments and America. “The President conveyed to the Prime Minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire,” the presidency disclosed. Biden had informed Netanyahu that the U.S. supported a cease-fire amid a call from 28 Democratic senators for ceasefire. Also on Wednesday, Netanyahu declared that the military offensive in the Gaza Strip will continue. Netanyahu, after his visit to military headquarters, said though he appreciated “the support of the American president,” Israel wants to return “calm and security” to the people. The Prime Minister stressed that he was “determined to continue this operation until its aim is met.” PDP loyalists plan massive defections in Taraba
