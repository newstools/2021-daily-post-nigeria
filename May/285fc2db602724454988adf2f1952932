Reno Omokri, former presidential aide has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of neglecting the Southern part of the country. Omokri berated Buhari for not visiting the Southern part of Nigeria since he assumed power in 2015. In a tweet, the former presidential aide wondered why Buhari has refused to visit the Southern part of the country. He lamented the president’s constant shuttles between Nigeria and London while ignoring the Southern part of the country. “Since he was sworn in for a second term, had General @MBuhari visited Southern Nigeria? “Not to my knowledge. Correct me if I’m wrong. “He shuttles between London and Northern Nigeria. Why is Southern Nigeria a no go area for Buhari? Is this how to govern a nation?,” Omokri tweeted. People of the Southeast had been accusing the Buhari-led government of marginalizing the region. Nnamdi Kanu and his group, the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, had severally accused the current government of turning away from the region. The alleged marginalization had further inflamed the pursuit for the actualization of Biafra.
