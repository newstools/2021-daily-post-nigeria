Atletico Madrid striker, Luis Suarez hit out at former club Barcelona for ‘underestimating’, ‘undervaluing’ him and making his family suffer. The emotional Uruguayan striker spoke to LaLiga TV after leading Diego Simeone’s side to their first La Liga title in seven years. The former Barcelona ace scored the winning goal in Atleti’s 2-1 victory over Real Valladolid to kill Real Madrid’s hopes of claiming the title. Valladolid had taken the lead through Oscar Plano but Atleti turned it around in the second half to maintain their two-point advantage over Zinedine Zidane’s Real.Madrid. Angel Correa and Suarez scored for Atletico as Zidane’s side in the other game came from behind to beat Villarreal 2-1 but failed in their defence of the 2019/20 title. Suarez scored 21 goals and made three assists across a phenomenal debut campaign with Atleti. “What I experienced was difficult. Barcelona didn’t value me, they underestimated me and Atletico opened the doors for me,” the Uruguay forward told La Liga TV. “I will always be grateful to this great club for trusting me. My wife, my children, they all suffered. I have been playing football for so many years and they never suffered so much. “It is an amazing feeling to perform in the final game of the season. ‘My work is to help the team and pay them back by scoring goals. “Atletico is a huge club and we have shown it this season. We have been the most consistent performers and that is why we are champions.” Luis Suarez picks better player, between Haaland, Mbappe
