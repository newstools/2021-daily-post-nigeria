Former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder, Emmanuel Petit, has said his former club, Chelsea could win the Champions League final on Saturday if they get clinical in front of goals. But the Frenchman admits Manchester City might break his heart and lift the trophy. Petit feels Chelsea are not clinical enough and that could cost them. City, by contrast, are more ruthless in front of goal and Petit thinks that will prove to be the difference in Porto. “When it comes to a final, and your whole season hangs on one game, you need to be clinical in both areas in front of goal. “Defensively with Chelsea, that’s guaranteed. But up front, I’m not so sure. “In a final you might get only two or three chances to score, and you need to take them. Chelsea have too many players who need four or five chances to score. “Manchester City have players who need only one chance. I don’t think there are going to be many chances in this game, so City are the better choice for me. That’s why I feel as though City are going to win this final,” Petit told Paddy Power.
