Governor of Cross River State, Prof. Ben Ayade has declared that more Governors elected on the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, platform will join the All Progressives Congress, APC, soon. “More Governors from the PDP are joining the APC. Just watch you’ll see and then realise that I know what I’m saying,” Ayade said on Channels Television Politics Today. DAILY POST reported Ayade’s defection to the APC on Thursday and he had said the purpose of dumping the PDP was due to the attributes of President Muhammadu Buhari and the realisation that Cross River, which has been emasculated economically following the ceding of its oil wells, needed to be in sync with the party at the center. Speaking further during the interview with Channels, the Governors also listed the individuals and groups that will join him in his new Party. According to him, “It is total. All the Councillors, Local Government Chairmen, almost all the House of Assembly members, most of the national assembly members, my entire commissioners and cabinet, that’s the amount of political structure…and all the LGAs I have built industries, industries in all the LGAs …all of that is coming in today.” Ayade added, “I feel so happy to be in APC… PDP stood by me, gave me the opportunity to be a Senator but my choice to join the APC is to help reduce the tension in Nigeria “I have offered myself to the government at the centre and encourage others to join too in helping the country tackle its challenges.” Why I joined APC – Ayade
