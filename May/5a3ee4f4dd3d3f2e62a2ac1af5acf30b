Against the backdrop of insecurity in Imo State, the State House of Assembly has enacted a law that will check the rising breakdown of law and order. The Assembly led by Paul Emeziem had, in an emergency seating on Friday, deliberated on the bill presented by the Deputy Majority Leader and member representing Ehime-mbano state constituency, Emeka Nduka. Presenting the bill, the Deputy Majority leader stressed the need to beef up the security network in the state, adding that the passage of the bill into law will go a long way in bringing the security situation in the state to the barest minimum. Nduka while leading the debate urged members to give their support to the passage of the bill as it is in the interest of Imo people. “Take for instance the level of crisis witnessed in the state in recent times. This bill, as you all know, if passed into law, will confront the prevailing security situation in the state and restore the relative peace and tranquillity which was the hallmark of the state. “You will agree with me that other southeast states have established their state security organizations or outfits. Imo State should not be left out given the rising breakdown of law and order.” ”The bill for a law to establish Imo security organization to assist in maintaining law and order in the state and other purposes thereto’, was given an accelerated hearing by members and eventually passed into law. The speaker, Paul Emeziem, while accenting to the bill on the committee of the whole, said the emergency seating was necessary at a time when the state is faced with security issues. It would be recalled that the Imo State Assembly, like other Houses of Assembly in the country, have been on strike for two months.
