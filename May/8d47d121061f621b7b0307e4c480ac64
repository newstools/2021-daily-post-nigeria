Two suspects, Abiodun Ogundele and Opeyemi Olatunbosun have been nabbed by the police for allegedly snatching a motorcycle at gunpoint in Ogun State. The Ogun State police command said the two, who “specialize in snatching motorcycles in Sango Ota and its environs”, were arrested on May 10. DAILY POST gathered that their arrest followed a distress call received at Sango divisional police headquarters at about 8pm, reporting that a motorcyclist, one Adesoji David, was being attacked at Joju area of Sango by the “armed hoodlums”. “Upon the distress call, the DPO of Sango Ota, CSP Godwin Idehai, quickly mobilized his men and moved to the scene. On sighting the policemen, the suspects, who had already snatched the victim’s Bajaj motorcycle, took to flight but were hotly chased and two amongst them were arrested, while the other one escaped,” police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi confirmed. Oyeyemi said one locally-made pistol, one live cartridge, one expended cartridge and the snatched motorcycle were recovered from the suspects. He disclosed that the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun had ordered the transfer of the suspects to the state CIID, while directing that the fleeing member of the gang be hunted down as soon as possible.
