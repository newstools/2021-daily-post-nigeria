Bashir Adigun, Special Adviser, Political Communication to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara State, has declared that people involved in the pilferage of the state’s assets will not go scot free. Speaking at a media parley at the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) press centre in Ilorin, the state capital, on Friday as part of the 2nd year anniversary of the ruling All Progressives Congress, he said, ” I can assure you that those indicted in the report will have justice served.” Adigun was reacting to the response of former Governor Bukola Saraki, who reacted to the white paper report of Barrister Hussein Buhari’s panel on unlawful sale of state government’s assets from May 29,1999 to May 29,2019. Saraki had reacted following the submission of the report to Governor Abdulrazaq, on Thursday, saying it was designed to distract the people from the key issues of governance. Buhari, while submitting the report lamented that there had been mind boggling pilferage of government’s assets in the last 16 years in the state. He mentioned the rot discovered at Shonga Farms, Kwara Malls, and government structures in Abuja, Lagos and Kaduna sold to people of the previous governments at giveaway prices. Buhari, appealed to the governor to have the courage and political will to implement the recommendations in the report. Kwara Assembly wants death penalty for kidnappers
