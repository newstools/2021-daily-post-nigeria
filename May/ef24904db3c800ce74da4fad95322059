The Police in Imo State have announced the activation of Operation Search and Flush to forestall further attacks. The commencement followed the directive of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba to the command to ensure peace in the state. In recent months, members of a gang popularly known as ‘unknown gunmen’ (UGM) destroyed security facilities in Imo and other states in South-East and South-South. The Police are the worst hit, with dozens of personnel killed or injured. Last month, the Nigerian Correctional Service and the Police headquarters in Owerri were hit. A statement by the Imo command spokesman, Ikeokwu Orlando, said the Commissioner, Abutu Yaro charged personnel to work towards the success of the operation. Yaro told them to be swift in the response to distress calls and neutralize “any bandit seen”. The Police chief informed officers and men that Governor Hope Uzodinma has made adequate arrangements for their welfare and assured that allowance will be promptly paid. He confirmed medical arrangements have been emplaced in case of injuries, as well as the provision of logistics and equipment. The teams will be posted to all the Local Government Areas in Imo for crime prevention /detection patrol and confidence-building patrols. Yaro warned against extortion and other corrupt practices, adding that “the Command will not hesitate to activate the force disciplinary mechanisms on anyone found culpable to any unethical conduct”. Meanwhile, operatives arrested Micheal Osundu, an alleged member of the ‘unknown gunmen’ in Owerri. One pump action rifle, more than twenty live cartridges and Police uniform were found in his possession. Security heightened in Abuja over reported invasion by bandits
