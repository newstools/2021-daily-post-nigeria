Three farmers in Oyan in Odo-Otin Local Government Area of Osun State were on Saturday allegedly attacked by some herdsmen on their farmland. The farmers, who are siblings; Opeyemi Joseph, Nathaniel Joseph and Friday Joseph, were allegedly attacked by herdsmen on their farmland situated at Afoyin, Erin-Ile in Kwara State around 7 pm on Saturday. One of the victims, Opeyemi on Sunday, said the Bororo herdsmen descended of them on the farmland while complaining over the farm destroyed by the cows. He said the herders invaded their maize and cassava farm with cattle and started grazing on it. Opeyemi said the herders attacked him and his brothers with batons in their hands after pleading with them to take their cattle away. “They occupied our farm with their cows. The cows were destroying the farm and I appealed to them to take their cows off the farmland but instead, they attacked us and ran away. “It was around 7 pm, so before we could reach the town, it was around 11 pm but went to the Oloyan’s palace to make a complaint and the king directed us to Erin-Ile,” he said. He added that he has reported the case to the Oloyan Of Oyan, Oba Kelani Adekeye who advised that they should approach a police station and the palace of Elerin of Erin-Ile since the case happened on his land. Meanwhile, Oba Adekeye could not be reached on phone as at the time of filing this report but a source in the palace confirmed the report.
