Edinson Cavani has decided to stay for one more year with Manchester United. Transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano said the Uruguay striker on Monday signed an extension to remain at Old Trafford. Romano tweeted that “the agreement has been completed. Cavani has accepted to stay after the Man Utd board and Solskjaer pushed to keep him. Confirmed and done deal.” He added that an official announcement is expected in the coming next days. Cavani’s future has been uncertain for a while, especially with speculation that he could fulfil his dreams of playing for Boca Juniors. But United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has managed to convince the former Paris Saint-Germain man who arrived last summer as a free agent, to continue in England.
