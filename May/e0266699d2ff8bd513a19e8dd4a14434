Gani Adams, the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, has said people of the Yoruba extraction are ready to die in the push to actualise Oduduwa Republic. Adams said some people of the Southwest are determined to pursue Oduduwa Republic. Speaking in Lagos yesterday, the former Oodua Peoples Congress, OPC, leader said the Southwest reserves the legitimate right to struggle for Oodua Republic. Adams also lamented that the struggle has been hijacked by top politicians in the region. He said: “It is unfortunate that some people are determined to weaken the spirit of the agitators. Unfolding events in the last few weeks have shown that some prominent politicians have hijacked the struggle for the actualisation of the O’odua Republic. “It is an attempt to distract us from the true and original intention of the struggle. “But I want to say it here that the struggle to seek a new nation is the legitimate rights that we are determined to live and die for and we wouldn’t waiver in our beliefs and determination to liberate our race.” Insecurity: God‘ll not forgive Buhari if Nigeria goes to war – Gani Adams
