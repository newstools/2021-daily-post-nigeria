Real Madrid midfielder, Casemiro, has insisted that Chelsea were better than his side following their Champions League exit on Wednesday. Casemiro also urged Real Madrid to now think about the LaLiga following their 2-0 defeat against Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final second leg tie at Stamford Bridge, thanks to goals from Timo Werner and Mason Mount. Chelsea eliminated Real Madrid from the Champions League on a 3-1 aggregate victory, having played a 1-1 draw against the LaLiga champions in the first-leg last week. “The first 25 minutes we played better, we had two chances with Karim,” Casemiro said post-match in comments carried by Diario AS. “Then there’s no explanation, they were better, they had more opportunities, and there’s no excuse. “We have to think about La Liga now, we have a difficult game against Sevilla, there is no use in regret. “We’re sad because it was a big game. They were better than us.”
