Shehu Sani, a former senator representing Kaduna Central in the National Assembly, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to pay a condolence visit to the families of Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, the late Chief of Army Staff, and other officers who died in the plane crash at the Kaduna Airport. Buhari, as well as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, were conspicuously missing at the funeral of the late Army chief, sparking reactions across social media. “The President should visit the bereaved families of the late COAS and other deceased officers, in order to make up for that unconscionable absence at the interment,” Shehu Sani tweeted in reaction to the President’s absence. DAILY POST had reported that Attahiru along with other officers were onboard a Beechcraft 350 aircraft belonging to the Nigerian Air Force that crashed on Friday.
