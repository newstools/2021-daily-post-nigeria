Manchester United striker, Marcus Rashford, was the target of racial attacks following their Europa League final defeat to Villarreal on Wednesday night. Rashford said he received “at least 70 racial slurs” on social media following Man United’s defeat against Villarreal in Gdansk, Poland. The England international played the entire 120 minutes as Man United drew 1-1 with Villarreal and scored his penalty in the shootout, which Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side lost 11-10 against the LaLiga side. But after the game, Rashford wrote on Twitter: “At least 70 racial slurs on my social accounts counted so far. “For those working to make me feel any worse than I already do, good luck trying.” Also reacting to the development, Man United said a number of their players were racially abused online following the final in Poland, although it is currently unclear who, other than Rashford, was targeted. The Red Devils tweeted: “Following the #UEL final, our players were subjected to disgraceful racist abuse. If you see any form of abuse or discrimination, act and report it.” Europa League: Why I’m scared of checking my phone – Arsenal’s Willian
