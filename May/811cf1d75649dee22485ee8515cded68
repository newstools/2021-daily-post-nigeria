New Barcelona signing, Sergio Aguero, has promised to help the club win silverwares. Aguero vowed to replicate the same outstanding display he produced during his time at Manchester City for the Camp Nou club. DAILY POST recalls that Barcelona officially signed Aguero from Manchester City on Monday. The Argentine international will remain at Barcelona until the end of the 2022/23 season. “I want to show here what I have shown at City,” Aguero was quoted by Barcelona’s official website as saying. “It’s an immense joy because since I was a kid, and even more so now with Messi, I have thought that Barça is the best club in the world. “Any player that is offered the chance to play at Barça, will come running. I will try to do my best to help the club to win big things.” EPL: Man City identify player to replace Sergio Aguero this summer
