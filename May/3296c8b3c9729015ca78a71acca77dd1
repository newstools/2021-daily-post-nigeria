West Brom manager, Sam Allardyce, has reacted after he suffered relegation from the Premier League for the first time in his managerial career. The Baggies lost 3-1 to Arsenal on Sunday night, confirming their drop from the Championship. Goals from Emile Smith Rowe, Nicolas Pepe gave the Gunners a two-goal lead, before Mathaus Pereira pulled one back for West Brom. Willian then struck a sublime free-kick late in the game to seal Allardyce’s men’s fate. Allardyce had established himself as a relegation escape artist during his various managerial spells in England’s top flight, but his 17th season in the division ultimately ended in failure, with West Brom relegated from the division for a joint-record fifth time. “It’s not sunk in yet. But I’m sure I’ll wake up tomorrow and realise the situation. I’m bitterly disappointed we’re not still in the fight. “I’m not saying we would have avoided relegation but we should have been closer, we should have taken it down to the last three games, based on how we performed,” Allardyce told BT Sport. When asked if he fancied trying to bring West Brom back to the Premier League next season, Allardyce added: “That’s too early to even consider or talk about that, for me. “It’s about getting over the disappointment and when the time is right to talk about what’s going to happen next season.” Chelsea vs West Brom: Allardyce reacts to ending Tuchel’s unbeaten run with 5-2 win
