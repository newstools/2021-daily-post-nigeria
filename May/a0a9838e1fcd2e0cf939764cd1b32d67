Former England coach, Fabio Capello, has warned Jose Mourinho he would have to build a better squad to achieve his aims and objectives at Roma. Mourinho was announced as Paulo Fonseca at the Serie A club on Tuesday. The 58-year-old who was sacked at Tottenham Hotspur will take charge from the 2021/2022 season. But Capello has said Mourinho’s arrival will not be enough. “It’s not enough to sign a great coach to win,” Capello told La Presse. “You also need the players. “He’s a very prestigious and experienced coach. And above all, he’s a coach who knows Italy well. “So, it’s all a lot easier. Roma is a difficult square, but he exalts himself in difficulty. I hope for Roma fans that he does as well as he did at Inter.”
