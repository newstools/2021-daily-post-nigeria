The Ogun Police Command on Thursday said it had commenced investigation into the four incidents of gas explosions in the state within a week. The state Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, told newsmen in Abeokuta that the command was looking into the cause of the recent gas explosions. Recall that two gas explosions occurred at Igbore and Mercy Road areas of Abeokuta on May 12 and May 13, respectively, involving loss of lives and injuries. Another gas explosion occurred on May 18 at the Conference Hotel on Boulvered Road, Abeokuta, owned by Chief Gbenga Daniel, a former governor of the state. Ajogun said that the state government had expressed concern over the development. He said that a technical team comprising; the Police, Department of State Security (DSS), the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON), the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and the Federal Fire Service (FFS) have been assembled. “We want to really find out the cause of the explosions. “We will know if it is as a result of human error, adulteration, expired cylinders or other technical issues,” he said. The CP, however, dismissed the insinuation of bomb explosions. “It is unfortunate that rumour mongers will be peddling rumours that the incidents are bomb explosions, but they are not, they are gas explosions. ”There is nothing to be scared of,” Ajogun said.
