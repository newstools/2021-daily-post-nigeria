Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has asked the club’s board to make a transfer move for Paris Saint-Germain defender, Marquinhos, this summer transfer window. According to the Sunday World, Tuchel has put forward his own list of recommendations to Chelsea’s hierarchy, and one of the names proposed is Marquinhos. Tuchel coached Marquinhos for over two years during his time at PSG before he was sacked by the French Ligue 1 champions last December. Marquinhos formed a solid partnership alongside Thiago Silva, who has thrived at Chelsea since joining the west London club on a free transfer last summer. Chelsea, however, will face the tough task of reuniting Tuchel with Marquinhos as the Brazilian international will still have three years remaining on his current contract with PSG this summer. Meanwhile, Tuchel recently admitted that he would give his own opinions to Chelsea’s board about their transfer targets but says he will not get displeased if the club are unable to sign the names of players he will put forward. “I have opinions about what we can add to the group to get better,” Tuchel said. “This is my job, and I will give my opinion, and I am asked my opinion, and we will do this, and sometimes opinions change. “This is also a process, and I’ve my ideas, of course. I have ideas for certain profiles. This isn’t about me wishing for this player A and B, and if they don’t come, I will get angry. This was never like this in my whole career. This will not be like this.”
