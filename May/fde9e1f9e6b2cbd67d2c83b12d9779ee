Paris Saint-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has claimed they “deserved better” than their Champions League semi-final exit on Tuesday. According to him, his players did enough across two legs to advance. Even though Manchester City qualified for the final with a 4-1 aggregate after their 2-0 second leg win, Pochettino insists PSG “dominated a very difficult team to control”. PSG failed to record a shot on target in the second leg at the Etihad, which was decided by a Riyad Mahrez brace. “If we analyse the two games, we dominated a very difficult team to control. “You need a small percentage of luck to score in key moments. “I am disappointed, because we deserved better. But Manchester City have been more clinical than us. They scored the goals we needed, we played the game we wanted with the plan we wanted. It’s a bit disappointing obviously, because the objective was to go to the final,” Pochettino said to RMC Sport.
