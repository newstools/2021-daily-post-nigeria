The Supreme Court today upheld a judgment of the Court of Appeal, which okayed the deregistration of the National Unity Party and 73 other political parties. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) last year deregistered the political parties. The electoral body cited their inability to win any election during the 2019 general elections as the reason. In the judgment delivered by Justice Adamu Jauro on Friday, the Supreme Court said the deregistration of NUP, one of the 74 parties, was done in line with the laws and in compliance with the extant provisions of the Constitution and Electoral Act.
