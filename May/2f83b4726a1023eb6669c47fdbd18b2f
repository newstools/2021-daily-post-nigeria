The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) on Thursday said it has restored power supply on most of its 33KVA feeders in Kaduna State. The development comes few hours after the Kaduna State government lamented that power was yet to be restored despite Nigeria Labour congress, NLC, calling off its 5-day warning strike. NAN reports that the TCN General Manager, Public Affairs, Mrs Ndidi Mbah in a statement in Abuja listed the 33kV feeders which TCN had restored power to include Mogadishu, Abakwa, Nigerian Airforce Base, Ungwa Dosa, Turunku, Arewa, Airport , Kinkinau , Narayi and Independence feeders. According to her, the Kaduna Distribution Company (KAEDCO) has also indicated readiness to pick supply. She said that the Jaji and Rigasa feeders had also been energized while Olam, PAN and UNTL are about to be energised. “The Waterworks feeder was energised but tripped as a result of fault. “TCN will continue to gradually restore supply on the other feeders as soon as KAEDCO indicates readiness to take supply,” she said.
