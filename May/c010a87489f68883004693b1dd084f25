A section of a three-storey building under construction at the Federal Medical Centre, Umuahia in Abia has collapsed. The Chief Medical Director of the facility, Prof. Azubuike Onyebuchi, confirmed the incident to newsmen in Umuahia saying the incident happened around 1.30am, NAN reports. He said the project was a modern Accident and Emergency building awarded to Home Option Construction Company Limited in 2019 at the cost of over N200 million. The CMD said the cause of the incident which happened in the early hours of Thursday is yet to be ascertained. “I woke up this morning and got a message from some of my staff members that part of the modern Accident and Emergency building had collapsed. “When I got to the scene, I saw that the section that is harbouring the third floor, which is the Intensive Care Unit that has been prepared for roofing, gave way from the middle, sparing the other sides. “I have sent for the contractor and consultant who are supervising the job and my Works Department. “They will give me professional advice on what happened so we can take it up from there and also inform the Board,” he said. Onyebuchi, however, thanked God that no life was lost but expressed regret over the incident. “The building is under construction. It has not been handed over to us, so it is still with those handling it. “It would have been more painful if it had been handed over to us and we were using it with both the patients and staff members inside there,” he added.
