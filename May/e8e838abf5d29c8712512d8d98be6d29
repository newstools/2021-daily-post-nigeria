The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to pay attention to the situation in Imo State. The National Chairman, Uche Secondus, told reporters on Wednesday in Abuja that federal authorities should intervene to forestall further incidents. Secondus accused the Imo State Government of plotting to rope perceived opponents in its probe of the attacks. The opposition leader stressed that Imo and other parts of the country needed adequate security. He advised the Police and the Department of State Services (DSS) to do a thorough investigation and not politicise what is going on in the South-East State. Secondus said the matter should not be a witch-hunt to the leaders in the state and former governors, “whether in PDP or those in disagreement with the government of Imo”. “That will cause more problems than good. We must be careful before we turn this to politics,” he warned. Secondus advised the National Assembly to pass the Electoral Act Amendment Bill and ensure Buhari signs into law. The PDP insisted that electoral reform was the key to the transparent, free and fair elections in Nigeria.
