The Nigerian Army has announced a new date for the passing out parade (POP) for regular recruits. The event was earlier slated for Saturday, May 22, 2021, but could not be held due to the funeral of Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, the late Chief of Army Staff, and other officers, who died in a plane crash in Kaduna. Captain Audu Arigu, NDA Assistant Director, Public Relations, in a statement said Attahiru was to attend the POP as the Reviewing Officer/Special Guest of Honour. The new schedule is 8 a.m on Saturday May 29 at the RSM Hama Kim Parade Ground. The POP is one of the activities to mark the end of the rigorous training involved in the process of becoming a soldier. The parade is the climax of recruits’ intensive drilling in the Depot Nigerian Army. The ceremony showcases the height of military discipline and regimentation.
