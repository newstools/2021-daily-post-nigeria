Seun Kuti, the youngest son of afro-beat legend, Fela, has accused Nigerian politicians of arming bandits with guns. Seun made the allegation in a video while reacting to several attacks on communities in the country, leading to kidnapping and killing of innocent citizens. According to him, if Nigerians want banditry to end, all politicians in the country should write down a list of people they have given guns to and the weapons should be retrieved. In a video posted on his Instagram page, he said, ”Politicians are the ones giving bandits guns in Nigeria. Let’s not act like we don’t know. ”If we want to end this banditry, all politicians should write down a list of people they’ve given guns to so we can go and collect it back. These are political thugs.” Bishop announces new prophecy about Nigeria’s breakup, Igbo presidency
