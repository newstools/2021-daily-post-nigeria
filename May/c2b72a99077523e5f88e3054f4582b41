The Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Sokoto State have arrested Omotade-Sparks Amos Sewanu, operator of the Inks Nation Ponzi Scheme. Omotade-Sparks who hails from Badagry in Lagos is the alleged mastermind of a huge investment scheme through which many citizens were defrauded of monies to the tune of over Thirty-Two Million Naira. He had allegedly floated a phony online digital currency called “Pinkoin” which lured unsuspecting members of the public to invest their hard earned money with a promise of unrealistic returns and also distributed a payment card called “Pink Card” to further confuse his victims. Omotade-Sparks was also accused of making false claims that he was in partnership with the EFCC to persuade people to invest in his devious scheme. Following the development, he was declared wanted by the EFCC in November 2020 after efforts to apprehend him failed. However, the anti-graft agency in a statement released said he was finally arrested on Thursday. According to the statement, the suspect is to be arraigned in court as soon as the investigation is completed.
