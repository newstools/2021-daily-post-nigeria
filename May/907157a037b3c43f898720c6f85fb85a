The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, has said that Ndigbo have nothing to lose if the military takes over the Nigerian government. DAILY POST reported yesterday that Robert Clarke, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, SAN, had called on President Muhammadu Buhari to hand over the government to the military temporarily in order to solve the security and economic dilemma Nigeria is facing. The elder statesman said that the military should take over the government temporarily and get Nigeria back to six States. But in a swift response, the Defence Headquarters discarded the call for military takeover and pledged to be loyal to a constitutional authority and remain apolitical. Ohanaeze Ndigbo, in a statement signed by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, its Secretary General, said, “We make bold to say that Igbos have nothing to lose since we’re the most marginalized group in Africa. “Who knows whether Igbos might fair better under military regime than the current Federal Government? “Who knows if military government might create additional States for the southeast? “A military Federal Government with elected civilian Governors might not be a bad idea”. “We urge President Buhari to speedily change the tempo towards addressing the insecurity challenges in the country as we will tirelessly support any peaceful process in the restoration of peace in the Southeast.”
