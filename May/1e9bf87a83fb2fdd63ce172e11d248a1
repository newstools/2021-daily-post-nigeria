Gunmen suspected to be militia have continued to make life unbearable for the people of Taraba State as they have continued to carry out attacks on residents of the State. DAILY POST gathered that two pregnant women and several other persons in Suntai village of Bali Local Government Council of the state have been abducted. Suntai village is the country home of the former late Governor Danbaba Danfulani Suntai, who was involved in a plane crash in 2012 which rendered him incapacitated, leading to his death. Before the abduction, our correspondent gathered that the community had been under threat of attack. A few residents of the community claimed to have on several occasions drew the attention of the security operatives to their plights, but no actions were taken. They lamented that if the security operatives were proactive enough, the recent abduction would have been averted, beckoning on the federal lgovernmnet to deploy more security operatives to the area. The victims were reportedly abducted from their farms while preparing for the forthcoming farming season. Though the council chairman could not be reached for confirmation, a senior official of the council said, “It is true that some farmers have been kidnapped but for now, I don’t know the exact number.” No contacts have been made by the hoodlums to the families of the victims as at press time.
