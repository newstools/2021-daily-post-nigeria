Michael Owen, former Liverpool player, has advised Tottenham Hotspur striker, Harry Kane, that it’s ‘now or never’ for him to leave the club this summer transfer window. DAILY POST recalls that Kane had drawn the interest of Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United in the past few days. The England captain has already told Tottenham he wants to leave the club this summer. Kane’s preference is to join Pep Guardiola‘s Manchester City and remain in the Premier League. But Owen believes Kane has done the brave thing and has warned the 27-year-old forward that this is his last chance to make a big move to another club, given his age and value in the transfer market. “You can’t blame @HKane wanting a new challenge,” Owen wrote on Twitter. “It’s a short career and @SpursOfficial are miles off winning things at present. It was now or never. “He’s shown great loyalty, but it would be a huge shame if he finishes his career with no medals to show for it.” Kane still has 3 years remaining on his current contract with Tottenham. He has scored over 200 goals for Spurs but has no single title to his name. EPL: Harry Kane names ‘special’ player in Chelsea squad
