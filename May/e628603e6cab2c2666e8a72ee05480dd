Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has urged his South East counterparts to put an end to the violence ravaging the region. He said this after the assassination of Ahmed Gulak, former Special Adviser on Political Matters to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan, on his way to the airport in Owerri, Imo State capital, on Sunday morning. Describing the murder of Gulak as a cowardly act, Akeredolu emphasized that the killing was a calculated move to instigate Nigerians against each other. According to the Governor, in a statement he personally signed, the murder was a senseless and wicked one, stressing that the criminals must be apprehended in order to tame their increasing terrorist acts. Akeredolu also stated that the killing of Gulak, who was an APC chieftain, bears the unmistakable and despicable imprints of fifth columnists bent on setting the country on the path of conflagration. He called on security agencies to not only apprehend the perpetrators of the crimes but to also unveil those sponsoring the “terrorist act”. “We want to use this medium to express our solidarity with our brother Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma. We admonish him and other Governors in the South Eastern States to brace up, and confront the current security challenge to put an end to the bloodbath in the land. The enemies of the people always employ the weapon of fear to create disaffection in the polity. “This cowardly act is calculated to instigate Nigerians against each other, particularly Northerners, against the Igbo living outside the South East. We must confront the enemies of the people with a view to neutralizing them. This is definitely not the time for politically correct news. Banditry should not be allowed to subvert the legitimacy of the current Government at all levels,” he said. Gunmen murder Jonathan’s ex-adviser Ahmed Gulak in Imo
