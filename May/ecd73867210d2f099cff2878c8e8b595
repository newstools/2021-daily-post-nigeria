Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has hailed the return of Mateo Kovacic to training and described it as “huge”. The Blues are hoping to win their first trophy of the season when they take on Leicester City in the FA Cup final on Saturday evening Tuchel has been boosted by midfielder Kovacic returning to full fitness. The Croatian has not featured for Chelsea since the 4-1 win over Crystal Palace on April 10 after suffering a hamstring injury. “It’s huge because Mateo has everything we need in the midfield. “Experience, power, he can beat players, he has the physical ability and has played big games in the Premier League. “When we missed N’Golo [Kante] and Mateo [Kovacic], we lacked a lot of quality, energy and experience. “Billy [Gilmour] did a good job in huge games but it’s not fair to compare him to these players because they have more experience and are a step ahead in their development. “It’s big news that [Kovacic] is back because he’s a big guy in the dressing room around important matches,” Tuchel said.
