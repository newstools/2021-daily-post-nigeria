Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on Sunday dismissed claims that Rochas Okorocha, Imo West Senator, gave the group N500 million. Kanu insisted that IPOB has never received any cash donation or financial assistance from Okorocha. There are reports that the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma had accused Okorocha of donating the huge sum to the seperatist group. However, Kanu, in a statement by IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful stressed that both Uzodinma and Okorocha can not bankroll the group. A statement by Powerful reads: “The attention of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) under the global command of great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has been drawn to the ridiculous claims by the Supreme Court Administrator of Imo State, Hopeless Uzodima, that former Governor of the state and his fellow traitor, Rochas Okorocha gave N500 million to IPOB. “We, therefore, wish to clarify that we never received any financial payment, donation or gift from Okorocha or any Efulefu like him. We have nothing to do with traitors like Okorocha and Uzodima. “The truth remains that both Okorocha and Uzodima cannot bankroll IPOB. Frankly speaking they do not have the financial clout to bankroll the largest mass movement in the world. We don’t need their stolen, ill gotten, blood-stained money. “They better fight their battle and leave IPOB out of their mess. None of them is good enough to receive our attention.” Meanwhile, Okorocha had denied donating N500million to IPOB while he was the governor of the state. The Senator had said the Uzodinma’s administration was rattled by his recent television interview, where he explained how he managed IPOB during his tenure as governor.
