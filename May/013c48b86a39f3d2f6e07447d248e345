The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II, has said that the receipt of the news of the death of Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, the Chief of Army Staff, and the other military officers in the air crash on Friday evening is a bitter pill to swallow. In a statement by his Director of Media and Public Affairs, Moses Olafare, the monarch described the departed military officers as change makers, who in their individual capacities contributed to the repositioning of the fight against insecurity in the country towards victory. In his words, “It is really a bitter pill to swallow, particularly as they were caught by the cold hand of death while rendering patriotic services to their beloved country. “On behalf of the entire House of Oduduwa worldwide, I wish to express my heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased, the military, and Nigerians in general over the departure of these heroes who paid the ultimate price for peace and security in Nigeria. “I pray that they all find eternal peace in the bosom of their creator”, the Ooni said.
