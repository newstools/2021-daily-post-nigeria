Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State says he doesn’t see another governor elected under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, defecting to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, soon. Ishaku said this while reacting to claims that another governor is planning to join the opposition party after Cross Rivers State Governor, Ben Ayade, defected from the PDP to the APC. The governor spoke on Friday while answering questions from State House correspondents at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. DAILY POST recalls that Ayade officially joined the APC at a ceremony in Calabar on Thursday attended by Governor Mai Bala-Buni of Yobe, who is the Caretaker Chairman of APC and other governors. Ishaku said, “I don’t see that happening. And like I said, even his own was a shock to some of us. I don’t see that happening. “For Nigeria, we should hope for a vibrant opposition that’ll help to put and maintain the system. Democracy without opposition is not a democracy.” “We are greatly shocked and embarrassed that he’ll suddenly dump the party for the APC because all of us see the PDP as an alternative to APC,” he added. “But be that as it may, I believe that any democratic country must have an opposition; a viable opposition and opposition in itself is good for democracy. “If you don’t have an opposition, then the government in power can go astray. “But as to the reason why our colleague in the PDP will depart, I don’t know the details, and I can’t vouch for him. “However, I want to assure you that all the governors in the PDP are doing well in their respective states. Possibly because we are in the opposition and the pressure is on us and we are doing the best we can.” Blame Gov Ishaku for insecurity in Taraba – Miyetti Allah
