Human rights activists in Ibadan, Oyo State on Saturday began a campaign against the rising insecurity, unemployment, poverty and other social problems confronting the country. The human rights crusaders noted that the level of insecurity occasioned by kidnappings, killings and attacks on innocent citizens were alarming. It said the looting of the wealth that belongs to all in the name of privatization, deregulation, increases in fuel price and electricity tariffs will only further impoverish the masses. The crusaders under the aegis of the People’s Alternative Political Movement (TPAP-M) said it launched the movement to keep the government on its toes to address the prevailing security challenges in the country. Chairman, Coordinating Committee and Secretary of TPA-M, Comrades Femi Aborisade and Abiodun Bamigboye respectively, noted that it is glaring that the ruling political parties in the country are not ready to solve the array of problems confronting the country.
“We are also convinced that all the capitalist ruling elites and their parties lack the programmes, policies and perspectives that may solve the socioeconomic problems confronting ordinary people. “The peaceful protest of Monday, 31st May is to commence the campaign against insecurity, poverty and other socioeconomic problems ravaging Nigeria at this present time. “Our understanding is that pervasive poverty is, primarily, at the root of pervasive insecurity. Prolonged and unprecedented growing levels of unemployment, hunger and homelessness breed anger and frustrations and force increasing layers of the victims into criminalities of banditry, kidnapping and terrorism, as a means of sustaining life. “There is a need to begin to form a government that will serve the interest of the mass majority of the working class and the poor and not to profit the interest of few as currently obtains.
