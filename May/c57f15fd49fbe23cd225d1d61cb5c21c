The Adamawa State Police Command has arrested 52 people for alleged kidnapping, armed robbery and rape. The arrest of the 52, effected between March this year and now, led to the recovery of seven AK47 rifles, four locally made guns, two G3 rifles, seven single-barrel guns, one pump action gun, 1000 rounds of live ammunition, five cartridges, one motorcycle, two handsets, among others. Commissioner of Police in the state, CP Adamu Aliyu, told newsmen in the course of parading the suspects on Tuesday that large quantities of hard drugs, bags of weed believed to be Indian hemp, rubber solution, among others, were also recovered. According to the CP, operatives of the state police command, while on confidence-building patrol and intelligence-led policing, apprehended the 52 suspects whose ages range from 17 to 40 years. Among the 52 suspects is 22-year-old Abubakar Usman who is charged with being one of the four young men who gang-raped a 25-year-old woman. “On the 16th of May 2021, operatives of the command attached to CID apprehended Abubakar Usman for inviting his three friends, Safiyana aka Pata, Ahmadu Ubandu and Didol who are now at large to jointly rape a 25-year-old woman (name withheld) who they deceitfully invited to Ebis Hotel in Demsawo, Yola,” the CP explained. CP Adamu Aliyu also named two people who he said were repentant kidnappers.  The two include Ibrahim Baba, a native of Zamfara State but resident in the Song Local Government Area of Adamawa State. He was said to have denounced kidnapping and handed over his two G3 rifles and five rounds of live ammunition. He named the second ‘repentant’ as Mohamed Ruwa “who also surfaced and surrendered to the police by denouncing his kidnapping activities.” Police confirm attack on personnel, death of officer in Adamawa
