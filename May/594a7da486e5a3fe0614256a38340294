Tottenham Hotspur manager, Tim Sherwood, has snubbed N’Golo Kante, and named Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho as the best two Blues midfielders presently. Sherwood said this ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League final day fixture against Aston Villa on Sunday at Villa Park. He also urged Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, not to feature Kante against Aston Villa. “At the beginning of the season, the two favoured were Jorginho and Kovacic,” Sherwood said, as quoted by The Chelsea Chronicle. “It was only because Kovacic picked up an injury that Kante came in and was outstanding when he came into the side. He showed Tuchel what he could deliver. “I would play my best team in the first game against Villa. “I am not sure Kante is in my best. I think Kovacic and Jorginho are my best two in midfield.” EPL: Brendan Rodgers speaks on comparisons between N’Golo Kante, Wilfred Ndidi
