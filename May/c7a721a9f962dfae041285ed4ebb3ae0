Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has reacted to the release of the 27 abducted students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka in Kaduna State. DAILY POST had reported that students were released on Wednesday. A source said that their freedom was facilitated by Sheikh Ahmad Gummi Dialogue committee in collaboration with former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo. Reacting on Twitter, Saraki said he hopes that the young students who will undoubtedly be traumatized by the horrific experience receive the necessary physical, psychological care and support they require. He also called on security agencies to work to strengthen the security around all educational institutions, and bolster their intelligence gathering to keep the nation’s students safe: “I join all Nigerians to thank Almighty God for the safe release of the 29 students that were abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka in Kaduna State. “At this time, our security agencies must not relent in tracking down all the perpetrators of this abduction and prosecuting them expeditiously under our laws — to serve as a strong deterrent to other nefarious actors.”
