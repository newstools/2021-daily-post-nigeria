The People’s Democratic Party, PDP has called for the immediate sack, investigation and prosecution of Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, as well as the suspended Managing Director of the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Bala Usman, over the alleged looting of over N165 billion in the agency. PDP in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan tasked the transport minister to come clean on its reported connection to the alleged involvement of his wife, Edith Amaechi, in the exposed N48 billion contract currently rocking the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC. “Our party insists that both the Minister and the indicted NPA Managing Director should be handed over to the Economic Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC for investigations and possible prosecution. “The NDDC contract scam involving the wife of the transport minister was siphoned under the guise of offering training to unsuspecting youths in the area. “It is indeed disgraceful that under the APC that promised to end corruption in Nigeria, the public space is awash with revelations of sharing government’s revenue amongst concubines, girlfriends, wives, family members and top APC leaders,” the statement read in part.
