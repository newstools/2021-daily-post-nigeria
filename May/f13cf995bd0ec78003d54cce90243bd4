Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has explained why he didn’t feature Antonio Rudiger and Timo Werner in his side’s Premier League 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on Wednesday night. Chelsea was defeated at Stamford Bridge after Jorginho’s poor back pass was saved on the line by Kepa Arizzabalaga, before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang set Emile Smith Rowe up for the winner. But Tuchel is now saying that he didn’t want to risk playing Rudiger and Werner against Arsenal due to overload and injury. Recall that Chelsea have already suffered injury problems in recent weeks, with Andreas Christensen having a tendon issue and Mateo Kovacic still struggling from a hamstring problem. “For Toni [Rudiger], we were at risk of overload and injury,” Tuchel told Chelsea’s website. “We lost already Andreas Christensen, so there was no chance I could take the risk now to have two central defenders out. The same with Timo Werner.” Chelsea’s next match is against Leicester City in the FA Cup final on Saturday. Champions League: Tuchel names three Chelsea players ready to fight for others
