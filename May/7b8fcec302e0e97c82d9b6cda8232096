Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has said change is “good for everyone” in the biggest hint that he will leave the club at the end of the season. Although Los Blancos still stand a chance of winning LaLiga, they have endured a largely disappointing campaign. Pressure has been growing on Zidane ever since Chelsea eliminated them from the Champions League at the semi-final stage. The Frenchman was asked about his future ahead of his side’s crucial game against Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. “The answer is very boring. There are two games left. I don’t know what will happen after that. “Anything could happen. This is Real Madrid. People think I would quit because I don’t want responsibility when things get complicated. That is not true. Everything I do I do to my best. “There comes a time when there must be change because it could be good for everyone. Sometimes you must be there and other times you must leave for the good of everyone,” Zidane said. UCL: Zidane announces Real Madrid squad to tackle Chelsea at Chelsea
