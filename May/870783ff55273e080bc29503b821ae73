The Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) has advised the motoring public on the need to avoid excessive speed to reduce the rate of road traffic crashes in Osun State. The FRSC Osun Sector Commander, Kudirat Ibrahim gave this advice while calling the attention of the general public to the 2021 Global Road Safety Day. The theme of the 2021 United Nations Global Road Safety Day is Speed Limit Violation, DAILY POST can report. The UN Global Road Safety Week is celebrated between 17 and 23 May annually and the campaign calls for 30km/h speed limits to be used in cities, towns and villages. The Sector Commander hinted that according to the World Health Organization (WHO), most of the deaths and severe injuries recorded during accidents are the result of excessive speeding. She also pointed out that some of the motoring public drive above the speed limits which brings about crashes, adding that the severity of crashes reduce when speed is under control. “During holidays when people stay at home, vehicular movement reduces but crash does not, because of the high speed at which motorists drive. “There is an urgent need for attitudinal change and discipline to create a safe motoring environment in the society. Hence driving at low speed should be the watchword at all times.” Ibrahim reiterated that just as the World Health Organisation is calling for low-speed limits, the Sector Command has enjoined the general public to go on speed as low as 30km/h within towns and village roads in Osun. She also enjoined commercial and private drivers to be mindful of all categories of road users emphasising that women drivers should be road safety advocates to be part of the effort at ensuring zero death on our roads. “This call has become necessary to achieve the target of the Decade of Action for Road Safety, 2021 to 2023”, she concluded.
