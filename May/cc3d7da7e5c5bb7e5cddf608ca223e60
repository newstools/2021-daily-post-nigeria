Newly-appointed Juventus manager, Max Allegri, has made a decision over Cristiano Ronaldo’s future at the club, according to Cadena Ser. Allegri only replaced Andrea Pirlo on Friday but is already shaping his squad, after they were dethroned as Serie A champions. Ronaldo finished the season as the league’s top scorer but will not feature in the 53-year-old’s plans. The Portugal captain is now considering his next move this summer and is being linked with Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United. The forward has one year left on his current deal and has never ruled out a return to United. Ronaldo scored 118 times in 292 appearances for the Red Devils before making an £80m move to Real Madrid in 2009. Serie A: Mass Allegri points out Ronaldo’s strength
