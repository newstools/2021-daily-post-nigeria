The whereabouts of the Sales Representative of New Telegraph newspaper in Imo State, Mr. Chuks Ugwuibe has become a source of worry after he was reportedly arrested by operatives of the Nigerian Police Force at the Banana Junction in Orlu. Ugwuibe was on Tuesday morning arrested around a news stand at Banana Junction, Orlu on his weekly routine trip of collecting sales returns for his company, New Telegraph. A police team reportedly swooped on the news stand and whisked him away alongside other victims. But the state Police spokesman, Orlando Ikeokwu when contacted, said he was yet to be briefed about the said arrest and promised to get back. The matter was also reported to the Police Control room where Ugwuibe’s name was put in circulation throughout the commands tactical units but all units claimed they did not have him in their custody. All efforts to find him after regular visits to all the units was equally unsuccessful. DAILY POST gathered that the inability to find him spiked the blood pressure of his wife who is heavily pregnant and subsequently led to premature delivery of their unborn child. Speaking during a press briefing, Mr. Udofia Alex Imoh, the Chairman, Association of Newspaper Sales Representatives, Imo State chapter, lamented the arrest of their colleague while calling on the security forces in the state to screen all their detainees to ascertain if Ugwuibe was amongst them. “He was actually trying to take his weekly returns from a vendor when he was arrested. “The association is pained that Ugwuibe’s family is passing through a terrible experience by the arrest of their father. “We, therefore, call on the security forces in the State to screen their detainees, especially those arrested at Orlu last Tuesday, to ascertain if Mr. Chuks Ugwuibe, is languishing in their custody,” he said.
