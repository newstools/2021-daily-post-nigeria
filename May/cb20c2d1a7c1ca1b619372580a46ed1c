Another headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Enugu State, was on Sunday night gutted by fire. The office is located at number 1 Achi Street by Agric Bank Bus stop in Independence Layout, Enugu. Recall that the INEC office in Obollo-Afor, Udenu was razed by fire a few days ago. Preliminary investigation had suggested that the fire may have been caused by power surge due to sudden power supply to the building. Police Commissioner in the state, Mr Mohammed Aliyu, who confirmed the incident to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said that he was still at the scene of the incident as of the time of filing this report. He said he was there to save the office from the disaster. NAN, however, gathered at the time of filing this report, that the Enugu State Fire Service, as well as the Federal Fire Service were also doing everything possible to quench the fire. Several calls made to INEC officials, especially the stateâ€™s Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Dr Emeka Ononamadu and the Public Relations Officer by NAN were not picked.
