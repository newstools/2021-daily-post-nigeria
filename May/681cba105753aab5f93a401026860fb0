Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has described the club’s legend, Sergio Aguero, as a lion in the jungle, taking steps to kill the opponent. Guardiola also said that the biggest quality Aguero has was his unique sense of goal. The Spaniard said this on Friday during his pre-match press conference ahead of Man City’s Premier League final day match against Everton on Sunday. Aguero, who is Premier League’s leading overseas goal scorer, will bring down the curtain on a glittering decade in the English top-flight league with Man City, when the recently crowned champions host Everton at the Etihad Stadium. Speaking ahead of the Everton match, Guardiola paid a glowing tribute to Aguero. “When he [Aguero] is fit and he has continuity in the training sessions and game, he is a guy like Romario,” Guardiola said, referencing the Brazilian legend with whom he shared a dressing room at Barcelona. “In five metres, he is like a lion in the jungle, making steps to kill the opponents. The biggest quality he has is a unique sense of goal. The last goal he scored at Crystal Palace defined Sergio perfectly. “He needs the first control, two or three steps, then wow. If he plays until 35, 40, 45, he will always score a goal. “It depends on his physical condition. When he is good in himself, he still can do whatever.” EPL: Man City identify player to replace Sergio Aguero this summer
