Officials of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria, JUSUN have barred newsmen from entering the Supreme Court to cover the judgment in the Edo State Governorship tussle. The officials led by Mr Adebayo were allegedly rude and aggressive in their approach towards the ban. They reportedly blocked the main gate of the apex court against newsmen on the ground that reporting the proceeding would sabotage the nationwide indefinite strike action of the union. However, unlike the previous weeks, lawyers and litigants especially politicians were allowed into the courtroom. All efforts to persuade the striking judiciary workers to see reason with Judiciary correspondents were rebuffed. The JUSUN men stood their ground on preventing the coverage of the event but agreed that interview could be conducted with parties in the matter after delivery of the judgment.
