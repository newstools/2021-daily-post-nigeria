Senator Ifeanyi Ubah (Anambra South) says the people of Nigeria are in a state of panic due to widespread insecurity. He spoke at the inauguration of a hall donated to Rotary District 9125, by Sir Emeka Offor Foundation (SEOF) in Abuja. The lawmaker, according to NAN, advised that a national summit on peace be convened as soon as possible. Uba observed many Nigerians have been advocating proper security architecture of the country. He said the summit would suggest clear objectives and solutions that will help to curb security challenges. “Looking at the country today, everybody is in a state of panic, and the only way for us to resolve this is to discuss”, Ubah insisted. In his remarks, Offor urged Nigerians to work together, pray together and engage in advocacy. He said some youths who make themselves available for criminality and violence “don’t even know what they are doing”.
