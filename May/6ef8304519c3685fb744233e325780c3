Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, believes Raheem Sterling was fortunate to stay on the field after a late foul on Timo Werner during Chelsea’s 2-1 victory against Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday. Goals from Hakim Ziyech and Marcos Alonso gave Chelsea all three points against Man City as Sterling’s first-half goal was not enough to give Pep Guardiola’s side a point at Etihad. Sterling made a late high foul on Werner, but after a VAR check, they stayed with referee Anthony Taylor’s initial decision of a yellow card. When asked about his thoughts on Sterling demanding a penalty after being involved in a clash with Kurt Zouma in the second half during the encounter, Tuchel said at his post-match press conference, “I only saw it live and I was in fear that he will maybe give it, but I found our first one a 50-50 situation. If he gives it live because it’s his impression, okay, maybe it’s not worth overturning it from VAR. If he wouldn’t whistle it live in his first impression, I think it also wouldn’t be worth overruling from VAR, so it was a pretty tough one. “Of course, we felt a bit like the momentum was completely against us because we were one man down actually from an injured player, had no time to do the change, and suddenly this whole game can slip through your fingers.” The win over Man City means Chelsea are now in the third position on the Premier League table with 64 points from 35 games.
