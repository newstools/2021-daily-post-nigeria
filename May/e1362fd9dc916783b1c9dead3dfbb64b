The new Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya officially assumed office on Friday. After he was introduced to senior officers at the Army Headquarters, he observed a one minute silence in honour of his predecessor, late Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru and other late officers. The eleven military men died in an air crash last Friday evening near the Kaduna airport. “May the souls of General Ibrahim Attahiru and all other officers who died rest in perfect peace”, he said. After his remark, a Major, who was the compere, asked the press to exit the room. Yahaya had signed the condolence register at headquarters of the Theatre Command of Operation HADIN KAI, Maiduguri, the Borno capital. The 55-year-old Sokoto-born COAS held different positions before now. He was Commander, Headquarters 4 Brigade and 29 Task Force Brigade (Operation Zaman Lafiya); Military Secretary; General Officer Commanding (GOC) 1 Division, and Theatre Commander Operation HADIN KAI.
