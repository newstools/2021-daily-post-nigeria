Haliru Shuaibu, Spokesman for Abuja National Mosque, in a statement said that the decision was taken after a special meeting with the FCT Minister, Mallam Bello, Council of Imams and stakeholders in the health sector. He said that it was resolved in the meeting that prayers would be conducted at the premises of the Abuja National Mosque with considerations for the second wave of the coronavirus. “Therefore, this means that the prayer of Eid-el-Fitr will take place at the Abuja National Mosque on Wednesday or Thursday depending on when the moon is sighted at 9:00.a.m. “All worshippers are advised to observe the COVID-19 protocols, including social distancing and wearing of face-masks. “We pray to Allah, the Most Merciful, to give our country everlasting peace,” he said.
