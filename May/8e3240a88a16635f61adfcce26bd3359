Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has commended the Federal Government and the administration of Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State over the rescue of the 27 abducted students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka. The students abducted few weeks ago were released on Wednesday. According to a source, the students’ freedom was facilitated by Sheikh Ahmad Gumi-led committee, in collaboration with former President, Olusegun Obasanjo. Reacting, Fani-Kayode also commended the Nigerian Army for the rescue of the students. He, however, vowed to attack and rebuke the government when necessary. In a series of tweets, the former minister wrote: “I commend the Kaduna State Government, the Federal Government and the @HQNigerianArmy for the rescue of 13 kidnapped persons from evil and barbaric terrorists in Gwagwada, Chikun LGA of Kaduna state earlier today after a fierce gun battle. “Way to go! More of this! I am proud of being a Nigerian again. “We must give credit, commend and applaud where and when it is due and we must attack, condemn and criticise where and when it is necessary. “I pray that they continue in this way. If they do we shall commend and applaud them. If they do not we shall attack, condemn and criticise them.”
