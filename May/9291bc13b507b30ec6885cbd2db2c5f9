Hundreds of residents of Gauraka Community in Tafa Local Government Area of Niger State on Monday blocked the Abuja-Kaduna Highway to protest regular kidnapping and insecurity in the community. Most protesters, mainly youths, blocked the highway and roads while they burnt tyres. Vehicular movement on the highway on Monday morning was disrupted for hours. The protesters demanded that the state and Federal Government should boost security in the area and the highway to stop the incessant attacks. According to them, kidnappers stormed the area on Saturday and Sunday, kidnapping at least 15 persons from the community and killing three others. Two residents, Mallam Ibrahim Dauda and Joseph Aboki, who spoke to DAILY POST said, “there have been speculations about Boko Haram terrorists infiltrating the Gauraka community after Governor Abubakar Bello announced that terrorists have hoisted their flags in some communities in Niger State in April.” They also said they have lost sleep due to the activities of kidnappers who have continued to terrorise the community. They explained that more than 30 people have been abducted from January till date. DAILYPOST recalls that Niger State has come under serious bandit attacks in recent times which have left hundreds of people killed.
