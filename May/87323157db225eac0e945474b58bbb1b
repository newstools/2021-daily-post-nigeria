Real Madrid is willing to sell Eden Hazard this summer. Marca reports that the LaLiga side could allow Hazard leave in the upcoming transfer window if they receive a bid of €50 million (£43.4m). Madrid splashed out £130 million to sign the 30-year-old from Chelsea in 2019. But Hazard has failed to make an impact at the Santiago Bernabeu since his move, thanks to multiple injuries and lack of fitness. The Belgium international delivered an anonymous display in the 2-0 defeat to Chelsea on Wednesday evening, as Los Blancos crashed out of the Champions League. And he went on to annoy Madrid fans after he was caught on camera laughing and joking with his former Blues teammates after the final whistle. Hazard has since apologised for his conduct but Madrid’s hierarchy has decided it is ready to listen to offers for him this summer.
