Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said the Premier League offers the only route for his team to play in Europe next season. The Gunners were dumped out of the Europa League on Thursday night, following a goalless draw with Villarreal. Arteta’s men had lost 2-1 in Spain last week. Their only realistic path to playing in Europe is if they finish in the top six spots. “The only way [to qualify for Europe] is through the Premier League so we know what we have ahead of us. “Today is a big disappointment because we tried everything,” Arteta told BT Sport.
