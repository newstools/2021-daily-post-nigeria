The Attorney General of the Federation AGF and Minister of Justice, Malam Abubakar, has hinted that the federal government will resuscitate special terrorism courts for sole purpose of trial of suspected terrorists in the country. Malami, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, said that the measure is part of the bold step of the presidency to tame the activities of terrorists that have been waging endless war against the nation. In his Sallah message to Nigerians, Malami said the federal government remained committed to ending insecurity in the country. He said in addition to the prosecution of 400 identified suspected Boko Haram financiers, the government has taken more measures to counter the twin trouble of insurgency and insecurity in the country. Malami’s Sallah was contained in a statement Thursday in Abuja by Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations. Malami said “Very soon, the Federal Government will, through the Federal Ministry of Justice’s Complex Case Group, resuscitate and reinvigorate the existing special terrorism prosecution courts in the country in order bring to book all those found guilty so as to serve as deterrence to others.” The AGF, therefore, urged Muslims as they celebrate Eid-el-Fitr to continue to be law-abiding, have sober reflection and exhibit the imbibed lessons learnt during the period of Ramadan fast. Malami also asked Nigerian Muslim faithful to imbibe the lessons of Ramadan by refrain from actions capable of setting the nation on fire. According to the Minister, Ramadan fast comes with numerous lessons
including sincerity, honesty, commitment, sacrifice, selflessness, introspection and empathy, among others. The Minister also used the message to salute the commitment of clerics in enlightening their followers on various issues during the months, urging them to maintain the tempo even beyond the period of Ramadan.
