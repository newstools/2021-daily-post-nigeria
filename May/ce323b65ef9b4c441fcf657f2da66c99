A former aide to Ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has reacted to the appointment of General Farouk Yahaya as the new Chief of Army Staff by President Muhammadu Buhari. Yahaya was appointed on Thursday to replace Major General Ibrahim Attahiru, who died in a plane crash on Friday. Omokri, in a post on his social media handles, asked President Buhari why he appointed another northern Muslim as the new Chief of Army Staff. His question was premised on claims that almost all sensitive positions in the nation are headed by northern Muslim men. This, Omokri said accounted for why the nation remained unbalanced. His words: “I congratulate General Farouk Yahaya on his appointment as the new Chief of Army Staff by General Muhammadu Buhari. “But my question is this, will Buhari die if he does not appoint a Northern Muslim Male into sensitive positions? “The Executive, Legislature, Judiciary, Ministry of Defence, Army, Police, Navy, NSA, DMI, EFCC, DSS, NCS, NIS, NPS, DIA, are all headed by Northern Muslim Males! “The reason why Nigeria is so unbalanced is because, there is no balance in appointments under Buhari,” he submitted.
