The governor added that the present situation in the country calls for sober reflection, stressing that “as you celebrate the end of Ramadan, I urge you to reflect on our situation as a nation and continue to pray for peace and security to return to Nigeria”. “I want to use this opportunity to urge our Muslim brothers and sisters as they celebrate Eid-el-Fitri, that COVID-19 is still much around. Hence, they should endeavour to observe the safety protocols and guidelines against the pandemic. “Also, they should engage in moderate celebration to mark the end of the fasting. The situation in our dear country calls for sober reflection and prayers, therefore, they should not forget to supplicate to the Almighty Allah for peace, tranquility, unity and security in the land.” Abiodun assured that his government shall continue to obey the Rule of Law and govern with the fear of God, wishing Muslim happy Eid-el-Fitri celebration.
