President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with the family of the late Dr. Chuba Okadigbo over the death of their son, Pharaoh. The one-time Senate President was Buhari’s running mate in the 2003 general election. The president’s condolence message was contained in a statement on Sunday by his spokesman, Femi Adesina. He said it is sad to lose a promising young man with potential and passion for youth involvement in the country’s socio-political development. The leader noted that the deceased keyed into the vision of a better Nigeria at an early age. Buhari said the nation will miss “a firm believer in the necessity for people to work in collaboration with governments at all levels to achieve a better society”. The president prayed that God would comfort Pharaoh’s family, friends and associates and repose the soul of the departed.
