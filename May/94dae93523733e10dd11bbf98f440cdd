The Federal Government has said that the £4.2m looted by former Governor James Ibori recently repatriated from the United Kingdom has been returned to Delta State. The Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, made this known in Abuja on Tuesday, when he appeared before the House of Representatives Adhoc Committee on Assessment and Status of All Recovered Loots. The Accountant-General told the Committee which was headed by Adejoro Adeogun that such funds looted from the treasury of a state are always returned to the state. He also added that states can sue the Federal Government to recover such funds. “Any recovery arising from looted funds from a particular state goes to the state. “The state governors would not even allow this to fly. They will take the Federal Government to court for holding their money. “So we don’t joke and we don’t play with that. We pay them their money. “I know there was a time when recovery was made on behalf of Plateau State and then for Bayelsa. “Such recoveries go specifically to those states,” he said.
