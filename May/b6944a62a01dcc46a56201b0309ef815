Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has claimed their 2-1 win over Manchester City on Saturday, will give them an edge over their rivals, ahead of the Champions League final later this month. The Blues came from behind to beat City on Saturday. Raheem Sterling gave the champions-elect the lead, before Hakim Ziyech and Marcos Alonso sealed victory for Tuchel’s men. The two sides will meet again on May 29 in Istanbul, with Chelsea having won the last two encounters between the teams. Speaking about the importance of today’s result, Tuchel told Sky Sports: “It gives us confidence because it’s all about the performance. “This result won’t change much as the (Champions League) final is a very unique game, you can’t predict what will happen and we need to be prepared. We both will have chances. “We arrive with the knowledge that we are capable of beating them, that’s what we have now and this won’t change much to Istanbul.” Champions League: Tuchel warns Guardiola ahead of final against Man City
