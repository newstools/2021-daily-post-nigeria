Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has blamed Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation over the insecurity crisis in the state. Wike said Amaechi was happy with the insecurity in the state, especially the killings of residents by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Amaechi had blamed the current insecurity in the state on high unemployment caused by the Wike-led government. Reacting, Wike said Amaechi, who was a former governor of the state was frustrated and has lost focus. The governor said his predecessor indicted President Muhammadu Buhari through his claims. A statement by Wike’s Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, said Amaechi indicted Buhari knowing that it was the president’s constitutional duties to ensure the security of Nigerians. The statement reads: “Is unemployment fueling insecurity in Kaduna, Plateau, Borno, Yobe, Ondo, Ebony, Imo, Niger States governed by the All Progressives Congress (APC)? “Is he (Amaechi) trying to indict his boss, President Muhammad Buhari, who is the Commander in Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and who is constitutionally saddled with the responsibility to provide security for Nigerians? “Perhaps, the minister is happy that members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) are killing innocent policemen, who were protecting lives and property. “Is Amaechi happy that the weapons of these slain security personnel were carted away by the hoodlums? Amaechi, from all indication, has lost focus and is now frustrated.” Lately, River State has witnessed some serious security challenges which have led to the death of both security operatives and some residents. Amaechi denies saying Buhari ordered CBN to print money
