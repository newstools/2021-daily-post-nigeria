Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has set a new target ahead of next season. Tuchel said he wants to win the ‘next title’ with Chelsea in the 2021/22 season, adding that he doesn’t want to rest. The German-led Chelsea to win the 2020/21 Champions League title on Saturday, beating Premier League champions Manchester City 1-0 in the final in Porto. Speaking on his new target, Tuchel was quoted by Chelsea’s website as saying on Monday, “It’s about the next one. “I experienced it on a lower level when I won my first title in professional football and it was even a nice feeling that it did not do too much to me. When we won the cup with Dortmund, I did not arrive at the next training with less hunger, with less desire or with less ambition. “Of course, now is the time to celebrate for some days and to enjoy it and let it sink in. This is the time now for one or two weeks to talk about it and reflect on it. But then surprisingly it does not do a lot to you, and I think that’s good because nobody wants to rest. “I don’t want to rest. I want the next one. I want the next success and I want the next title and I want the next process on the same level of quality of consistency. “I want to be a part of it and this is what comes next. Make no mistake about it.” EPL: Thomas Tuchel sets next big target, warns Chelsea players after 1-0 win over Man City
