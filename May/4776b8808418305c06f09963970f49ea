Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan has criticized Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, for asking Nigerians to pray for President Muhammadu Buhari. Omokri described Tinubu as a hypocrite for asking Nigerians to pray for Buhari. He was reacting to Tinubu’s salah message where he urged Nigerians to put aside their political differences and pray for the President. The former Lagos State governor had said Nigerians should pray that God gives Buhari strength and wisdom to protect Nigerians. Reacting, Omokri wondered why Tinubu never asked Nigerians to pray for Jonathan while he was in power. In a tweet, the former presidential aide wrote: “In a statement today, Bola @AsiwajuTinubu asked Nigerians to ‘put politics aside’ and pray for General @MBuhari. “Tinubu is a hypocrite. Did he put politics aside to pray for then President @GEJonathan? “Instead, both Tinubu and Buhari asked Jonathan to resign!” Ejike Mbaka: “Buhari wants to set Nigeria ablaze”- Omokri reacts to alleged arrest
