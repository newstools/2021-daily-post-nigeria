The Osun State Caretaker Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adegboyega Famodun, has commended the courage and political will of the Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade for dumping the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Famodun, in a statement issued by his Media Aide, Kola Olabisi, and made available to DAILY POST yesterday, said the defection to the APC by Ayade was a product of a very deep thinking of a rare ability to decipher from a metaphorically derailed PDP and the APC, which is solidly on the track. The Osun State APC Chairman stated that it took an uncommon hindsight for Governor Ayade to say bye-bye to Nigeria’s main opposition party which has literally turned itself to a neatly punctured raw egg whose content has spilled on the ground without any hope of redemption, whether now or in the nearest future. He congratulated the entire people of Cross River State on the defection of their governor to the only unrivalled ruling political party in Nigeria. Famodun said he was convinced that the governor’s defection to the APC would, in no time, further improve the fortune of his state in terms of developmental projects. While enjoining other opposition party chieftains to brace up and fast track their decision to come over to the APC, he pleaded with the governors under the PDP to also quickly do the needful. He assured the people of Cross River State that the governor’s defection into the APC from the PDP was a perfect decision which would positively impact on the state. In his words: “I am elated with the development of Governor Ayade’s defection as it is a pointer to the fact that a sizable number of Nigerians are acknowledging the various monumental achievements of President Buhari’s administration nationwide. “My appeal to other PDP governors is to borrow a leaf from the Cross River State Governor in order for them to have secured places in the APC train that merely has a stopover for whoever is willing to identify with the successful administration of President Buhari in his visible genuine efforts to transform Nigeria”.
