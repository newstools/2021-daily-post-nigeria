A group of Northerners were caught on tape looting valuables from shop owners at Arab road in the Kubwa area of Abuja on Thursday. The residents watched helplessly as the scores of young men carted away items like generator, chairs, fridge, among others. A viral showed they perpetrated the theft in broad daylight. Some of them were armed with sticks and clubs. The people around confirmed they were of Hausa ethnic tribe, while the victims were mostly Southerners. A statement on Friday by ASP Mariam Yusuf Police Public Relations Officer, FCT Command, confirmed the looting. Yusuf said the incident occurred after the Development Control of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) conducted a demolition exercise. “However, some yet to be identified residents seized the opportunity to loot items from the demolition sites”, the spokesperson noted. The PRO added that police operatives from Kubwa Division later moved to the scene “to restore calm within the area and arrest the suspects”. The Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma has ordered an investigation and appealed to residents to remain calm and law-abiding.
