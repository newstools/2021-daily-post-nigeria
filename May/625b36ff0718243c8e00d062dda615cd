The All Progressives Congress (APC) youths in Plateau State have urged the party to zone the presidency to the North-Central region. President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure ends May 29, 2023. Shendam Solomon, former APC youth leader, told newsmen in Jos on Saturday that their call would guarantee justice, equity and fairness. Solomon stated that 2023 affords the party leadership the chance to correct the snub of the region. He added that the North-Central has been “shut out” of the presidential seat since independence in 1960. “The injustice against the North Central is unfair and 2023 offers the party leaders the opportunity to correct it by zoning the Presidency to North Central,” Solomon said.
