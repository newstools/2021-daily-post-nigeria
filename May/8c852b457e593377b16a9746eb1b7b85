Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has warned his players that they could have a bad title defence like Liverpool. Last season, the Reds finished 18 points above second-place City. However, this time around, Jurgen Klopp’s men trail the new champions by 17 points, ahead of the final round of games. “Last season Liverpool were unstoppable, and everyone believed that this season they would be the same again. “But that is a good lesson for us. Nothing is [taken] for granted. Everything can happen. “Also we can have injuries next season, and we can have bad moments. That’s why the warnings always have to be on. “We have to connect in our decisions, and try to be consistent and competitive in the future,” Guardiola said.
