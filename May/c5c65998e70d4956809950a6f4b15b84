Arsenal defender David Luiz has told the club’s hierarchy that he will leave the Emirates at the end of the season, according to Metro UK. The 34-year-old Brazilian joined the club in the summer of 2019 from London rivals Chelsea after failing out with former Blues’ boss Frank Lampard. However, the former Paris Saint-Germain defender did not enjoy his first season at the Emirates but has improved this season. Luiz and Arsenal subsequently opted to trigger a 12-month extension clause and the former Chelsea star has arguably been Arsenal’s most consistent central defender this term. Injuries, however, have prevented the Brazilian from playing a full role during the decisive period of the campaign. He underwent minor knee surgery last month and was ruled out of action for six weeks and then suffered a hamstring strain in his comeback appearance against Newcastle which ruled him out of the Europa League semi-final second leg against Villarreal.
