Senate President, Ahmed Lawan says the essence of a good government is the continued ability to improve the protection and welfare of the people. Lawan made the remark during his address at the 2021 May Day celebration on Saturday in Abuja. Represented by Sen. Godiya Akwashiki, Vice Chairman of the Media and Public Affairs Committee, Lawan thanked Nigerian workers for their sacrifices. “We are also ensuring that our efforts are not just a one-off. We remain committed to improving on them. The security challenges are not insurmountable”, he said. Lawan assured that the government was providing ways of surmounting the challenges facing the country. The Senate President lamented that some criminal elements had taken up wrong paths like kidnapping, insurgency and banditry for survival. “Those paths are not acceptable and we shall continue to confront these paths and make sure they become a thing of the past in the country.” The lawmaker added that the national assembly and other arms of government are determined to ensure peace for the development of Nigeria.
