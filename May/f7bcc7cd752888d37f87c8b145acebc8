The Presidency has said that the suspect declared wanted by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission, ICPC, isn’t an in-law to President Muhammadu Buhari as claimed in some quarters. The President’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, confirmed this in a statement on Friday in Abuja. The ICPC had declared one Gimba Ya’u Kumo wanted for alleged misappropriation of $65 million National Housing Funds. Kumo, a former Managing Director of the Federal Mortgage bank, got married to Buhari’s daughter in 2016 in Daura, Katsina State. However, Shehu disclosed that the (marriage) relationship had since ended some years ago. ”A running story to the effect that the ICPC has declared ‘an in-law of the President’ wanted in connection with fraud involving the large sum of money, 65 million dollars to be exact,” the statement read in part “To set the records straight, the person declared wanted by the ICPC isn’t an in-law to President Buhari. “While at some point in time, the said fugitive from justice had been linked to a family member in marriage, that relationship ended some years ago. ”It’s, therefore, unfortunate to bring the President’s family into this case. ”The President’s position at all times is that the law be allowed to take its course. ”As is well known of him, President Muhammadu Buhari will not provide any cover for crime, no matter who is involved.” ICPC sets up anti-corruption, transparency unit in Fed Poly, Akwa Ibom
