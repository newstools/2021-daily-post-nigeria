The Police in Anambra State has condemned the jungle justice meted to three men suspected to be thieves in Anambra State. The men were nabbed by members of the public in Nkpor town, near Onitsha on Thursday, they were chained while used tyres were hung on their necks and they were set ablaze. DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, spokesperson of Anambra State Police Command, who reacted to the incident on Friday described it as ‘mob action’ and ‘jungle Justice’. Ikenga said the proper thing to do was to hand the suspects over to the police for investigation and possibly charge them to court, instead of killing them in such a manner. Ikenga in a release made available to DAILY POST read: “The Anambra State Police Command has noted with great concern the increase in cases of mob action in the state by some members of the public who resort to jungle justice whenever they arrest suspects in respect of criminal allegations without recourse to the Police for proper investigation. “Commissioner of Police CP Chris Owolabi while thanking members of the public for assisting the Police in apprehending suspected criminals (previously) also urged them to always exercise restraint by not taking the law into their hands. “They should endeavour to take such suspects to the nearest Police Station whenever they are apprehended. This would allow the Police to conduct an appropriate investigation into the nefarious activities of the suspects and bring them to justice in accordance with extant laws.” Cases of jungle justice are on the rise in Onitsha since the killing of policemen has forced men of the police force out of the roads and shutting down most police stations.
