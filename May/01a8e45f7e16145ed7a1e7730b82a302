President Muhammadu Buhari received former Lagos and Osun Governors, Bola Tinubu and Bisi Akande, at the State House, Abuja on Tuesday. The All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftains and others condoled with the President over the Kaduna air crash. The mishap claimed the lives of Army Chief, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru and other officers. In his condolence message, Tinubu called the accident a tragic, unspeakable loss for the nation. He regretted that Attahiru died at a moment the country is fighting terrorism and banditry in many states. Tinubu urged Nigerians to gather “strength and fortitude” and “finish the job to which they dedicated and gave their lives.” Yoruba nation: Tinubu, Gbaja, Akande, APC governors disagree with Sunday Igboho
