Barcelona president, Joan Laporta, has offered fans hope that Lionel Messi will extend his stay at the club. Messi’s current contract with the LaLiga side is set to expire this summer. “The Messi issue is going well, but it’s not done,’ he said. “Messi wants Barcelona very much. We are doing everything possible within our means,” Laporta told a press conference on Friday. Laporta also addressed rumours he was looking to bring Pep Guardiola back as manager, with Ronald Koeman’s future at the Nou Camp uncertain. Koeman was only able to win the Copa del Rey this season, but finished third in LaLiga and was eliminated from the Champions League in the round of 16. When asked directly about the prospect of Guardiola returning to the club, Laporta said: “The only thing in my head is I hope he wins the Champions League. “After winning it with us it would be amazing if he wins with Manchester City.” Barcelona hold “very positive” talks with Messi
