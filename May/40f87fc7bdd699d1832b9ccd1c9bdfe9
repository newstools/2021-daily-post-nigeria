Boxing promoter, Eddie Hearn, has said Anthony Joshua vs Tyson Fury will be staged in Saudi Arabia on August 7 or 14. However, Hearn admitted he is “frustrated” the fight is yet to be finalised. He claimed Joshua is growing impatient with Fury, who is yet to agree to the remaining terms but remains confident the fight will be announced this week. “August 7th, August 14th,” Hearn told Sky Sports News about a potential date. “I think it’s a very bad secret that the fight is happening in Saudi Arabia. To be honest with you, I don’t mind giving you that information. Bob Arum [Fury’s US promoter] has already done it. “It’s the same people that we did the deal with Andy Ruiz [rematch]. That event was spectacular. “As partners, they were fantastic as well. We’re very comfortable. Anthony is very comfortable, he knows those people. They’ve delivered on every one of their promises last time. We’re ready to go. “That’s going to be the date. Of course, you’ve got the Olympics finishing on August 7th, so in terms of a global spectacle, it would make sense to go on the 14th. That’s one of the things to tick off in the next, hopefully, few days,” Hearn told Sky Sports. Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury ‘approve’ offer for undisputed world title fight
