Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture, has promised Nigerians that the Federal Government of Nigeria is working to bring the labour crisis rocking Kaduna State to a peaceful end. The minister said this while answering questions from State House Correspondents in Abuja, after Wednesday’s Federal Executive Council, FEC, meeting at the Presidential Villa. He explained that the Federal Government was disturbed about the sudden turn of events in Kaduna State, adding that Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment, is already working to broker a truce between the opposing sides. Mohammed said, “The Federal Government is not folding its arms and already, the Minister of Labour and Employment has waded in, and he is in touch with both the government of Kaduna State and the Labour. “In addition, the security apparatus all over the country have also taken pre-emptive measures to ensure that hoodlums don’t take advantage of this situation. “In particular, I know that the police have reinforced their patrol between Kaduna and Abuja so that we don’t witness kidnappers taking advantage of the situation. “Overall, I think the Federal Government is quite concerned and is doing its best to see how the two parties can resolve their misunderstandings amicably, with little loss to productivity, little loss to properties. “At the end of the day, all the parties have to come back to the drawing table to agree and hammer out concessions and agreements.” Tinubu, reason APC is in govt today – Keyamo, Sani
