Oyo State Government has announced the restriction in movement of persons and goods between 6am and 3pm on Saturday, May 22. Secretary to the State Government, Olubamiwo Adeosun, in a statement said this would enable voters in the 33 local governments to participate actively in tomorrow’s election. The restriction would also help officials of the Oyo State Independent Electoral Commission (OYSIEC) to conduct the poll without hindrance. Adeosun urged residents to freely participate in the election and remain law-abiding. “Only persons on essential duties would be exempted from the restriction order,” the statement added. The public was advised to comply with the instruction to avoid any form of brushes with security operatives. “Indigenes and residents are enjoined to go about their duties peacefully while they go out to cast their votes in line with prescribed guidelines of OYSIEC,” Adeosun added.
