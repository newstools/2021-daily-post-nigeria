Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has promised owner Roman Abramovich that will “stay hungry”, after winning the club’s second ever Champions League title. In doing so, Tuchel earned himself an automatic contract extension. Abramovich has seen his decision to sack club legend Frank Lampard in January justified within the first six months. But Tuchel is ready to deliver more silverware at Stamford Bridge. He told the Blues’ official website in his message for Abramovich: “I can assure him that I will stay hungry. “I want the next title and I feel absolutely happy, I feel part of a really ambitious club and a strong part of a strong group that suits my beliefs and suits my passion about football at the moment perfectly. “So my desire is to go for more victories. My desire is to grow as a coach and my desire is to push the group on the first day of the next season to the limit. “We have work to do. We have to close the gap and this is what I am all about.” EPL: Lampard opens up on Abramovich replacing him with Tuchel
