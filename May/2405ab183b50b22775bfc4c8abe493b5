Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar has signed a new deal with the club to keep him at Parc des Princes until June 2025. The 29-year-old claimed “happiness” was the main factor in extending his stay. Neymar was heavily linked with a return to Barcelona, the club he left for PSG in 2017 in a world-record £200m deal. However, he has now put pen to paper on a bumper five-year deal with the Ligue 1 giants. “I have grown as a person here, as a human being and as a player, too,” he told the PSG website. The Brazil international has scored 85 goals and registered 51 assists in 112 games for PSG. Neymar clashes with Djalo in tunnel after red card in PSG’s 1-0 defeat to Lille
