Gunmen dressed in army camouflage have abducted Alhaji Wakili Damina, Chairman of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) in Kogi State. Mr Adamu Abubakar, the state Secretary of MACBAN, who confirmed the incident said Damina was abducted on April 30. Abubakar explained that some witnesses of the abduction who gave details of the incident said the gunmen numbering about eight, came in a white bus at about noon and “forcefully” took away the Chairman from his house at Chikara village, Kogi Local Government. He also confirmed that Damina’s younger brother witnessed the incident. The Secretary said Damina’s number was switched off when he repeatedly called about an hour later. Abubakar explained that he immediately notified the state Commissioner of police of the development, adding that the state government was also informed through the Special Adviser on security matters to the governor, Mr Jerry Omodara. He said a search party raised by MACBAN had visited other places, including abattoirs in and around Abuja to no avail. Reacting, the state Commissioner for Police, Mr Ede Ayuba, told NAN that the police is yet to locate the whereabouts of the Chairman. He added that efforts to get detailed information about the incident were unsuccessful as the matter was not officially reported to him.
