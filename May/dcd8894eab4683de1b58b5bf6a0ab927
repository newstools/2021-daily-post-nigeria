Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has denied announcing interest to contest the 2023 presidential election. On Monday, his office disowned a website calling on Nigerians to join a volunteer organization mobilizing support. A statement by Presidential Aide, Laolu Akande, said solicitation by the group is trending on WhatsApp with a suggestion that the Vice President “quietly” declared intention to run. Akande said the VP was not in any way connected to the said website or the group behind it and considers such an enterprise an unnecessary distraction. “Prof. Osinbajo has not declared any interest whatsoever in the 2023 election”, the spokesman noted. “He is rather focused on working in his capacity as Vice President in the current administration to address all the compelling issues in the country and concerns of Nigerians, including finding effective and lasting solutions to the security challenges. “We ask that people desist from such unhelpful permutations while we all deal together with the challenges confronting us as Nigerians, and resolve them for the benefit of our people, peace and prosperity in the land”, the statement read.
