Primate Elijah Ayodele, the INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church leader, has cautioned the Southeast against contesting the 2023 presidential election. Primate Ayodele warned that the presidency would elude the Southeast in 2023. He spoke while reacting to comments that the Igbo Presidency was the solution to Nigeria’s economic and insecurity challenges. Some groups from the Southeast advocating for Nigeria’s next president to come from the region had stressed that the Igbo presidency was the panacea to the country’s woes. However, Primate Ayodele, in an exclusive chat with DAILY POST, pointed out that the pendulum is not swinging towards the southeast. He said: “Who said Igbo president is the solution? It’s not a matter of ethnicity or where you are coming from; as a matter of fact, we need a very good person that God has ordained to be our president. “Igbo presidency is not the solution to Nigerians problem, I am not a politician but am speaking as a prophet not as a pastor because so many pastors have corrupted the system and can’t tell the truth because they believe they are of government interest. However, everybody is of government interests. If the government is not doing the right, there are some prophets that God will send to the nation, to the prime ministers in the bible, telling them that he is against their ruling. So people who are saying those right words; they will not want them. “So I am telling you that the 2023 presidency will elude the Igbo, mark my words; if they are looking for the presidency maybe they will wait for another time. The pendulum is not swinging towards the Igbos. “I will say let’s do it rotationally when it’s Igbo turn, let them do it, but the spirit of Igbo is no more in Nigeria, and since their spirit is no more in Nigeria, the country will break peacefully.”
