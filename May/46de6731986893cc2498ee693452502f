The Nigerian Army says it has commenced investigation into a speculation over the gruesome murder and extortion of a woman by security operatives in Katsina State. According to the army, it was alleged that the woman was arrested in a commercial vehicle with money estimated to be N420,000 by members of a local vigilante group on Wednesday, 7 May 2021, at about 10:00 pm, in Yankara village, along Funtua-Gusau road and was handed over to the troops in order to find out the source of the money. This was contained in a press statement signed by the Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima, saying that a few days later the woman was said to have been killed by the troops. “The Nigerian Army therefore wishes to inform the general public that it has commenced investigation into the matter and assure the public that anyone found wanting in connection with the allegation will be made to face the full wrath of the law. The Army pleads with the general public to remain calm as it is determined to get to the root of the matter “Nigerian Army once again reiterates its commitment to the protection of lives and properties of the citizens in accordance with its constitutional responsibility and strict adherence to the rules of engagements in its operations. Therefore, the Nigeria Army will not tolerate any act of misconduct and un professionalism from its personnel.”
