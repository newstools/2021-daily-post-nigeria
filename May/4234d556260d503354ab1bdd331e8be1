The Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of Zone 9 headquarters, Umuahia, AIG Ene Okon has tasked politicians and other stakeholders to discourage the wanton killing of security agencies and razing of Police stations in the South East zone. Okon made this known while interacting with stakeholders, including traditional rulers, the leadership of tricycle and Okada operators, youth organizations and Hotel Association in Ebonyi State, which took place at the International Conference Centre, Abakaliki. The AIG further noted that the funds earmarked in rebuilding police stations would have served in the execution of other forms of developmental projects in the region. He urged community leaders to synergize with security agencies towards addressing the spate of insecurity in the country. “We are here so that we can find out how the Police can serve you better. This stakeholders’ meeting is basically for you. We want to serve you better. Ebonyi has been transformed unlike how it was many years ago. “In any agrarian society you must expect pockets of communal clashes. These criminals are operating within your community. They are your brothers and sisters. 80 percent of policemen in the South East are Igbos. When you kill a policeman, you have killed your brother. “It is your brother that you are killing in the police. After killing your brother who will now police you. The money used in rebuilding police stations would have been used for other developmental projects. At the end of killing security operatives, criminals will turn around to kill you. Let’s maintain peace in our community,” he said. Earlier in a remark, the State Commissioner of Police, CP Aliyu Garba explained that the Police would record more successes through collaboration with the people of the State. He assured that information released to the police by members of the public would be handled with utmost confidentiality. “Stop attacking police officers”- AIG appeals to Nigerians
