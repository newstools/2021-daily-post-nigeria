Barcelona have decided that former midfielder, Xavi Hernandez, will replace Ronald Koeman as their new manager, according to Sport. The Catalans’ hopes of winning the LaLiga title ended last Sunday, following a 2-1 home defeat to Celta Vigo. Barca have now lost to Celta Vigo and Granada, and drawn with Levante, in recent weeks. Koeman will now be dismissed ahead of the 2021/2022 campaign. The Blaugrana will bring back Al-Sadd boss Xavi to the Nou Camp. The former Spain midfielder, who is widely considered among the greatest players in Barcelona’s history, made 767 appearances for the club between 1998 to 2015. Xavi has reportedly arrived in Spain for a vacation, with many believing he will hold talks with his former club over the potentially soon-to-be vacant managerial position.
