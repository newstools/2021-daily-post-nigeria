Barcelona is desperate to land Jorginho this summer and has resolved to offer Chelsea Miralem Pjanic in an exchange deal, according to Sport. Pjanic has been linked to a transfer to Chelsea this summer. But Barcelona is interested in bringing Jorginho to Camp Nou at the end of the season. Barcelona has demanded the Italy midfielder in return for Pjanic if Chelsea look to pursue the Bosnia international further. Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, is starting to formulate his plans ahead of next season, with several players on his mind. A striker and a centre-back are top of the wish list, but Pjanic has also emerged as a potential target for the Blues. Meanwhile, with Liverpool midfielder, Georginio Wijnaldum, heavily linked to a move to Barcelona this summer, Pjanic could see his spot in Ronald Koeman’s squad come under threat.
