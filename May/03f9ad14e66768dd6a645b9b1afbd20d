Arsenal hero, Paul Merson, has warned Tottenham striker, Harry Kane, against joining Manchester United or Chelsea this summer transfer window. Kane has been heavily linked with a transfer move to Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City in the past few days. The England captain recently told Tottenham he wants to leave the club this summer. But Merson wants the 27-year-old to instead join Man City ahead of Man United and Chelsea if he wants to win trophies in the near future. “If Harry Kane wants to win trophies, he has to go to Manchester City. You’re guaranteed to win trophies there,” Merson told the Daily Star. “But he would have more of a chance of breaking Alan Shearer’s record as the greatest goalscorer in Premier League history if he stayed at Spurs. “At City, he won’t play every game against the lesser teams in the league where you can win by three or four goals. “They will save him for those big Champions League nights. And maybe that is what he wants – but Shearer’s record would be a hell of a thing to break. “If he goes to United and they don’t win the league, he is suddenly under scrutiny. And I don’t think he could join Chelsea even if it did mean he doesn’t have to uproot his family. “Going there would be like Sol Campbell leaving Spurs for Arsenal. The fans would hate him if he did that. So City makes the most sense.” Champions League: Tuchel told to replace Werner with Aguero
