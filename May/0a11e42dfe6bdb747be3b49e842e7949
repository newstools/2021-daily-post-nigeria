National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Uche Secondus says Nigeria is in serious trouble in view of the widespread insecurity. In an Eid el Fitri message, the opposition leader urged the people to reflect on the situation and pray especially for genuine leadership to save the country. “The country is in serious trouble because of the glaring absence of leadership at a time it is most needed”, he noted. Secondus while congratulating Muslims on the 30-day Ramadan fasting period, said the nation’s democracy “more than ever before since 1999 is under a heavy stress that needs all hands to be on deck for its survival”. He said six years after the All Progressives Congress (APC) assumed power, indicators are apparent that it is under such pressure that needs prayers and commitment of Nigerians for survival “Most of the problems confronting the ordinary people would have been solved if leaders absorb the lessons of Ramadan and allow it to influence their conduct in and out of office” “The only way the last 30 days of fasting and prayer will be meaningful in our lives as a nation is if we allow the solemnness of the period to influence our thoughts and actions in relating with one another,” Secondus added. The PDP leader appealed to Nigerians of all faith to continue to maintain their harmonious inter-faith relations for the attainment of the desired peace.
