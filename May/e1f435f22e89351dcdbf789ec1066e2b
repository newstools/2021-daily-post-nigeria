The Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, has suggested full, open and transparent investigation into the intercepted Helicopter reportedly dropping supplies to bandits. The forum noted that a transparent investigation by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government would give a clear picture of the helicopter and clear any doubt that is being speculated. Emmanuel Yawe, the ACF National Publicity Secretary in a statement believed that a full investigation on the issue would clear every doubt about the country’s security challenges. The forum observed that at the peak of the kidnap of students of the Jangebe Government Girls’ Secondary School, Zamfara State, this year, the Federal Government slammed a ban on flights over the State. ACF explained that its National Chairman, Chief Audu Ogbe issued a statement calling for the ban to be extended to other states where there were rumours that arms, foodstuffs and other supplies were being dropped for bandits by a mysterious helicopter. According to ACF, “Today, there are various accounts that a helicopter that has been used to drop supplies for the criminals has been arrested. The accounts are rather confusing with the rather scandalous accusation that a former Head of State, General Abubakar Abdulsalami is the owner of the aircraft.” The forum noted that even though General Abdulsalam has since dismissed the rumour that he owned the helicopter, there was need for investigation due to the sordid revelations in the media. ACF is convinced that there is need for an open and transparent investigation on the orders of President and Commander in Chief, Muhammadu Buhari. The forum believed that the result of the investigation would “clear whatever doubts there are about righting the country’s security challenges.” Insecurity: Be mindful of your utterances – Arewa group cautions leaders
