Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, on Thursday, faulted the removal of history subject school curriculum in Nigeria. The governor, who spoke in Makurdi at ‘Media Week and Communications Day 2021’ organized by the Directorate of Social Communications, Catholic Diocese of Makurdi, said the removal would prevent posterity from having knowledge of important events in the country. According to him, if the Federal Government fails to restore the subject, the state government would initiate law to ensure it is taught in Benue schools. The governor said: “Removing the subject History from the country’s school curriculum is an evil agenda to prevent the young generation from knowing their past. “Even if Nigeria won’t restore the study of history to the school curriculum, we in Benue will initiate a legislation to make history a compulsory subject in schools in the state. “Our children need to know how their forefathers lived on this land hundreds of years ago. Our children need to know what took place at Ushongo Hills in 1804 and why this land and our people were not conquered till this day.”
