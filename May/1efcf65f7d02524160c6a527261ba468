Robbers on Tuesday allegedly invaded Bishop Crowder Memorial School, Egerton Road, Onitsha, Anambra State, stealing phones, laptops and other valuables from teachers in the mission school. A source told DAILY POST that two men, said to be armed and riding in a tricycle stormed the school compound, and entered some offices, where they stole phones, laptops and other valuables belonging to teachers. The source said: “One of the affected victims is the Headmistress of the school. She was said to be holding an important meeting with some members of staff of the school when the incident happened. “She and the teachers were holding a meeting downstairs when one of the hoodlums who had arrived at the school premises in a tricycle quietly walked upstairs to the Headmistress office which was said to be open and collected her phone which was left on the table. “The armed man also walked into the primary section of the school and attempted to pick another phone which was left on the table by the class teacher who was also in the meeting, but when the pupils threatened to shout, he left it and made away.” DAILY POST gathered that the incident has thrown the entire school into confusion as such an incident had never been experienced in the mission school. When our correspondent reached the spokesperson of Anambra State police command, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga for reaction, he did not take calls, nor did he reply messages sent to him.
