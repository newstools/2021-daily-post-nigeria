The Rivers State Police Command has paraded a member of the Abia State Vigilante Service identified as Chukwuma Okorie, who allegedly conspired with his colleague to kill his employer, Enyinaya Ogbonna. Ogbonna was said to have visited Nigeria from the United States to invest in the gas industry in Abia. The deceased reportedly employed the suspect, Okorie, to provide security for his gas station. According to the spokesman of the Rivers State Police Command, Nnamdi Omoni, Okorie developed animosity for his late boss and eventually shot him dead on Sunday night. The police PRO who briefed journalists on Thursday, at the command’s headquarters in Port Harcourt, said “the suspects shot the deceased with a pump action gun and continued their criminal act and decided to take the man’s car to Port Harcourt for sale whereupon he was intercepted by the police and arrested”. “We have recovered the pump action gun among other exhibits and investigation is ongoing”. The police spokesman also disclosed that the second suspect in the crime has been arrested in Abia. Speaking earlier, the suspect, who confessed to the crime, explained that a disagreement with his boss led to the killing. He said his boss had earlier warned him against bringing friends to his duty post which he flouted, leading to an altercation and the eventual death of his boss.
