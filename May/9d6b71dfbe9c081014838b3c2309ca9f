The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Godwin Emefiele has urged youths in Nigeria to embrace agriculture, declaring the bank’s readiness to support them. Emefiele spoke in Katsina on Thursday at the unveiling of the first maize pyramid and flag-off of the 2021 Maize wet season farming under the CBN-Maize Association of Nigeria (MAAN) Anchor Borrowers’ Programme. He said with over 50,000 bags of maize at the venue and others aggregated across the country, maize farmers sent a resounding message that they can meet the country’s demand. Emefiele noted that youths could leverage their talents, along with technological tools, to improve farm productivity and delivery of agricultural produce to markets. The CBN chief confirmed measures to improve access to credit for youths interested in Agriculture under the Anchor Borrowers Programme and the Agri Business Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS). “The CBN will not only provide access to credit for these youths but will also provide guarantees that their produce will be purchased by a prime anchor at agreed prices,” he said. Emefiele vowed that the CBN would resist attempts by those who seek to continually import maize, noting that maize farmers had the capacity to close the maize demand gap of over 4.5 million metric tonnes. He explained that the maize unveiled at the ceremony would be sold to reputable feed processors for positive impact on current poultry feed prices.
