The Senator representing Imo West, Rochas Okorocha, has said President Muhammadu Buhari must deal with poverty and injustice, as they have caused anger and frustration among Nigerians. Okorocha stated this while hosting less privileged Nigerian Muslims in his private office in Abuja, on Tuesday. The former Governor of Imo State said Buhari must address injustice and tackle poverty in order to restore calm. “I will comfortably say 75% are not happy at this moment. There is nothing productive that can come from Nigeria for as long as this alarming number remains unhappy. “Whatever we can use to guarantee their happiness as a nation, we should do that. “You cannot solve a problem unless you know the cause. “The cause of our Nigerian problem lies in injustice and poverty. The quicker this government moves to address injustice, the better it is to reduce the level of anger on the nation,” Okorocha said.
