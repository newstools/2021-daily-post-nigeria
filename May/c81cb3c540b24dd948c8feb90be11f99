President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the boat mishap in Tijana village of Munya Local Government Area of Niger. The president, in a condolence message issued by his spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Monday, extended his heartfelt sympathies to the families of the dead and the injured. The President said this incident is more disheartening as the victims were reportedly Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). While commending the life-saving work of the first responders and local divers at the scene of the incident, Buhari wished the wounded a speedy recovery and success on the search and rescue of some missing passengers on the capsized boat. “I urge the transportation authorities to ensure strict adherence to safety regulations on the nation’s waterways and urged that lessons from this accident should help prevent a future occurrence,” the President said. He further assured residents of the state that restoring long term stability and peace is a core objective of the Federal Government working with the State Government and other critical stakeholders in the local communities.
