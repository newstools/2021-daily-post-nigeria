It was all tears of joy as parents and sympathizers gathered to welcome the 27 abducted students of Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna on Friday. Their arrival witnessed all sorts of praises to God by parents and well wishers, who have been praying for God’s mercy on their safe return without being killed as earlier threatened by the bandits if their ransom was not paid. One of the abducted students, Miss Jennifer Peter, stated that it is an experience she would not forget in a hurry, saying that she is yet to come to her senses. She noted that throughout their stay in the bush with the bandits, they were given substantial food to eat, adding that the feeding was not regular. She, however, denied being mistreated by the bandits but noted that she wouldn’t want anybody to go through such a horrible experience. One of the parents, Mr Paul Bello, explained that throughout the period, the students were abducted, it was a trying moment for them. He thanked God and all those that helped in ensuring the safe return of their children form captivity. The 27 children were handed over to their parents with some of the affected students taken back to the hospitals by their parents for better treatment.
