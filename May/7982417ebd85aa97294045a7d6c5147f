Troops of Operation Hadin Kai on Tuesday raided a suspected Boko Haram logistics stockpile in Kurkareta town, Yobe State. The Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Mohammed Yerima, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. According to Yerima, some of the items recovered during the raid in conjunction with local vigilantes include 62 jerry cans loaded with Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, hidden in different houses and shops. Three vehicles belonging to the terrorists’ suppliers with registration numbers DAL 626 YE (Kano), GBK 413 GR (Benue) and XA 390 SHN (Borno) were also impounded.

Yerima added that all the recovered items and the suspects are in the Army’s custody for preliminary investigations before handing them over to the appropriate agency for prosecution. He reiterated the Nigerian Army’s determination to sustain its offensive operations in the area and assured the public that the Army leadership is committed to achieving the overall objective of keeping the North East and the entire country free of terrorism, banditry and other violent crimes.
