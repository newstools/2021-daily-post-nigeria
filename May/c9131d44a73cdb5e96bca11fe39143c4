The Holy month of Ramadan is a beautiful blend of fasting, feasting and faith. Aside from the heightened devotion and spiritual reflection that accompanies this month, there’s also the generosity and the special family bonding that happens over choicest delicacies during iftar. In the true spirit of Ramadan, the makers of exotic, refreshing malt beverage – Fayrouz went all out to demonstrate just how far a heart of generosity and an iftar meal can go in this time. Kickstarting the Holy Month with its #iftarwithFayrouz campaign, Fayrouz delighted a Muslim family in Abuja with three packs of Fayrouz and a food basket to break their fast. This was undoubtedly an exciting experience for the unsuspecting family! To spice up the experience, popular fashion model Usman Shagari alongside the camera crew, paid a surprise visit to the winner’s home to deliver the gift package. One can only begin to imagine the shock the winner must have experienced opening the front door to see Usman Shagari! Further extending their charitable hand beyond the Federal Capital Territory, Fayrouz hosted an exciting competition that allowed consumers to gift their Muslim friends and family residing in Kaduna, Kano, Abuja and Lagos a special Ramadan gift package courtesy of Fayrouz. Participants were encouraged to share what Ramadan means to them for a chance to win a delightful gift package. Several families residing in these states emerged winners in this competition and went home with the Ramadan package containing a pack of Fayrouz and a mouth-watering food basket. Fayrouz certainly gave Muslim faithfuls across the country a Ramadan to remember as not only did they receive a free meal to break their fast, but they also spent time bonding and creating memories over #iftarwithFayrouz.
