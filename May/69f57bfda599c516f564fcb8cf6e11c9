Thomas Tuchel has become the first coach to reach the European Cup or Champions League final in consecutive years with different clubs. Chelsea beat Real Madrid 2-0 on Wednesday night in their semi-final second leg, to seal a 3-1 aggregate win. The Blues will face Premier League rivals Manchester City in the final. Last year, Tuchel led PSG to the final, where the Ligue 1 side lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich. When BT Sport told Tuchel he must be doing something right to have achieved such a feat, he replied: “Or not because it’s not the same club! It depends who you ask.” The German then added: “I’m very happy that we’ve achieved this. I’m very grateful to have the opportunity to live my life in football and this passion as a profession. “So grateful to do it on this level and to get to another final, I’m very grateful for that.”
