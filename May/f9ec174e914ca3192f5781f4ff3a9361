Residents of Umuahia, the capital of Abia State, have been thrown into panic as unknown armed men stormed the area, shooting sporadically. DAILY POST gathered that traders and motorists in the area have taken to their heels with their wares to avoid being hit by bullets. As at the time of this report, DAILY POST could not confirm exact casualties, but a tricycle operator who pleaded anonymity, claimed that two lives, including that of a police officer at the Okpara Square. He stated that the police officer was killed during a gun duel between the police and the unknown bandits around the busy Okpara Square/Mission Hill road when the gunmen attempted to attack government assets. Effort to reach the Police Public Relations of the Abia State Police Command, SP Godfrey Ogbonna, for comments proved abortive. More details later. Nigerians in a state of panic â€“ Ifeanyi Ubah
