Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has insisted he does not care about the appointment of Mateu Lahoz as the referee for their Champions League final against Chelsea, despite his history with the Spanish official. Guardiola criticized Lahoz after they were eliminated from the Champions League quarter-final in 2018 against Liverpool. The City boss claimed Lahoz “likes to be different, he likes to be special” after he ruled out a Leroy Sane goal. However, Guardiola has said he “couldn’t care less” that he will take charge against Chelsea in Porto on Saturday. “Not one second [has he thought about it],” Guardiola said at a news conference on Monday. “I couldn’t care less. I am so confident in my team. You cannot imagine how confident I am in my team and what we have to do.” UCL: ‘It’s like you have personal issue with Mane’ – Klopp confronts referee
