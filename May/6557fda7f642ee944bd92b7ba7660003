Borno South Senator, Ali Ndume has alleged that things are so bad within the Nigerian Army. Ndume said the Nigerian Army now rations ammunition for soldiers. Speaking in Abuja on Tuesday, the lawmaker said military personnel were lamenting over the lack of funds. Ndume lamented that soldiers no longer carry new AK-47 rifles. He noted that the situation of insecurity had gotten to a stage where citizens negotiate with criminals elements to ensure peace. According to Ndume: “Never in the history of this country has Nigeria been challenged from various angles like this time. It has gotten so bad that in this country of ours, citizens now negotiate with criminals to live in peace. “When we confront the Nigerian army, ‘why are you not performing?’, they will tell us ‘we don’t have money; we only manage with what we have.’ “I interact with the armed forces very regularly. It is so bad that the Nigerian Army is rationing ammunition. Rationing is common. They ration ammunition. I have gone round the formations; I have not seen a Nigerian soldier holding a brand new AK-47 yet.” Boko Haram and bandits have been on the prowl in the Northern part of the country. Several students have been abducted and killed by these terrorist groups.
