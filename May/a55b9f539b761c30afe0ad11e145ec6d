Parents of the remaining kidnapped 16 students and three staff of Greenfield University, on Friday, said they cannot pay N160m ransom demanded by the abductors of their children. According to them, the bandits are demanding N160 million cumulative ransom for them to release the remaining 16 persons held captive. They appealed to the Federal Government to urgently assist them in rescuing their children from the bandits. Speaking during a prayer session on Friday, by parents of the abducted students, Chairman of the parents’ forum, Mr. Marcus Zarmai, who spoke on behalf of the parents, appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to use his office to secure the release of the students before something sinister happens to them. “We are worried about their safety. The innocent students had spent 24 days in the kidnappers’ den,” he said According to him, the kidnappers are demanding a sum of N10 million on each of the 16 students, making N160 million. “Even after, we the parents have collectively paid them over N60 million ransom for the release of our children and they failed to release them.” Zarmai said, having exhausted all the money they have to pay as ransom, “We, the parents are appealing to the Federal Government to assist us to pay the ransom demanded or find any other way to ensure the safe return of our children.” DAILYPOST recalls that, the kidnappers had already killed five of the kidnapped students, and had three weeks ago threatened to kill the remaining 16 students if the ransom is not paid. Though, the parents have already paid 60 million Naira, the kidnappers are still demanding additional 100million Naira However, Sheikh Ahmed Gummi had come out to say they have reached out to the bandits and they have agreed not to kill the remaining students.
