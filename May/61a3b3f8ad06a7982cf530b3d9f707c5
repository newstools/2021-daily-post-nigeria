A former England winger, John Barnes, has told Tottenham’s Harry Kane to snub a transfer move to Manchester City and instead sign for Chelsea or Manchester United. Kane has already informed Tottenham he will leave the club this summer. Man City, Chelsea and Man United are all interested in signing the England captain. But Barnes believes it would be in Kane’s best interest to not join Pep Guardiola’s side. “As far as the three clubs go, he [Harry Kane] should pick Chelsea or Manchester United rather than Manchester City,” Barnes told BonusCodeBets. “If he goes to Manchester City, he’s not going to be the player he is at Tottenham, because at Tottenham he is the creator, goal scorer and the focal point for everything. “Whereas, at Man City, he would not be that as there are other players that provide for him, it is a more comprehensive way of playing that he would not be used to. “Chelsea and Manchester United need a centre forward. Manchester United have good players around them. They have got Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood, but they really need a No 9. “Chelsea also needs a striker, and it seems as if Thomas Tuchel does not fancy Tammy Abraham or Timo Werner.” Tottenham vs Man United: Harry Kane gives condition to leave Mourinho’s men
