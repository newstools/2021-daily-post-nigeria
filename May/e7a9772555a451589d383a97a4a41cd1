The Senate on Wednesday, advised the Federal Government to delay its planned rollout of 5G network technology in Nigeria. This followed the adoption of the report of its Joint Committee on Science and Technology, ICT, Cyber Crime, and Primary Health at Wednesday’s plenary. NAN reports that the Chairperson of the Committee, Sen. Oluremi Tinubu who presented the report said that the committee’s investigation revealed that there was no connection between COVID-19 and 5G network technologies. “Concerning the interaction between COVID-19 and 5G network technologies, the joint committee confirms and is convinced that there is no connection between them. “The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by biological agent-virus- which is scientifically unconnected with the 5G technology. “While the joint committee clarifies that there is no 5G deployment in Nigeria at the moment and that no licence has been issued to any Mobile Number Operator on commercial basis, it is our recommendation that Nigeria should still observe the trend of 5G deployments around the globe and engage in extensive sensitisation of the public through all channels before commencement of commercial deployments in the country,” Tinubu added.
