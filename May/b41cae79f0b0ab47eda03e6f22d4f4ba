DAILY POST has gathered that yesterday’s attack on INEC headquarters in Awka and ‘B’ division police station were repelled by men of the police force on duty. A visit to the affected areas on Monday morning showed that three Hilux vans used by the attackers were successfully recovered by the police. Three of the Hilux vans seen by our reporter at the INEC headquarters were unregistered. While one of the vans was demobilized by the police, another ran into an electric pole, while the third was abandoned by the attackers. Contrary to reports by various media organizations (not DAILY POST), the ‘B’ division police station was not burnt down, while only a section of the INEC headquarters containing generating sets were blown up by explosives. A police officer, who pleaded anonymity, said no casualty was registered from both side. As of the time of filing this report, the entire area has been cordoned off, while journalists are still awaiting briefing and inspection of the attacked facility by CP Chris Awolabi.
