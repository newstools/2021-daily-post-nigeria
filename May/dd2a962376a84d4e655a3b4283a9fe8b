Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has declared that he has no preferred candidate in the forthcoming Local Government (LG) elections in Lagos State. Tinubu said this while denying claims that he has endorsed any candidate for the forthcoming LG election in Lagos. In a statement on Sunday, Tinubu dismissed the allegations of a plot to influence the APC’s primaries, saying the party Governance Advisory Council in Lagos met last Friday to talk about ways to ensure fairness for the poll. “Asiwaju Bola Tinubu would like it to be known, by way of this statement, that he has no preferred candidates for the upcoming local government primaries. “He has no intention to endorse any of the people contesting for the party nomination in any election, whether for chairmanship or councillorship positions. “On this matter, Asiwaju believes he can speak for the rest of the GAC regarding their belief in the impartiality and transparency of the internal party process. “Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and the other GAC leaders seek a free, fair, and transparent process in which the candidates who emerge are those who gather the most support among the party rank and file. “Only in this manner do we best prepare ourselves for the general election,” the statement read in part. Tinubu, however, urged all aspirants to compete with zeal, energy and to respect the results of the primaries.
