Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has reiterated his administration’s openness to positive criticism, saying it will deepen democracy and good governance. Sule made this remark on Monday in Keana Local Government Area of the State during a meet-the-people tour to mark his administration’s second anniversary. He said the essence of the tour was to afford him an opportunity to visit every local government to say thank you to the people, especially royal fathers who have been supporting him in the last two years and to ask for more support. The Governor said that the feedback tour was an opportunity for him to meet face-to-face with people who usually have difficulty seeing him on their own since he assumed office in the last two years. The Governor said his administration had welcomed criticism and advice on where it had done wrong so as to seek improvement. “With the town hall meeting, it will give people an opportunity to see us directly to commend us where we have done right or criticise us where we have done wrong. “There is nothing wrong in telling us why did you do that instead of doing this if there is no criticism and opposition, there is no democracy,” he said.
