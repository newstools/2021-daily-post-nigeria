Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez, is ready to sanction winger Eden Hazard’s exit from the club amid interest from Chelsea, Marca report. Perez would be happy to offload the Belgium international, whose contract with the LaLiga giants will expire in 2024. Hazard wants to leave Real Madrid this summer and is eyeing a return to Chelsea. The winger joined Real Madrid from Chelsea in a £130 million deal in 2019 but he has struggled for form and fitness at the club due to several injuries. Hazard made just ten starts in LaLiga and only three more in the Champions League this season. The 30-year-old was heavily criticized earlier this month after he was spotted laughing and joking with Chelsea stars Edouard Mendy and Kurt Zouma when he returned to Stamford Bridge with Zinedine Zidane’s side for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final tie.
