Hon. Shaeed Akinade-Fijabi, former member of House of Representatives, has warned the All Progressives Congress, APC, against denying its National Leader, Bola Tinubu presidential ticket in 2023. Akinade-Fijabi warned that a third party will emerge if APC fails to field Tinubu as its presidential candidate. The former lawmaker warned that the third party in favour of Tinubu would counter both the APC and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. He spoke on a live radio program in Ibadan, yesterday on the possibilities of the former Lagos State governor emerging as Nigeria’s next president. Fijabi, who represented Ibadan Northwest/Southwest under APC, at the 7th and 8th Assembly said: “Our people are unpredictable, there might be emergence of third party to counter the two existing ones (PDP and APC) if Asiwaju Tinubu is denied presidential ticket by APC in 2023.” He assured that the APC would come back stronger, ahead of 2023 in Oyo State. The former lawmaker explained that reconciliation was currently ongoing within the party to unify all the aggrieved members. APC zones 2023 governorship to Enugu East
