The Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado-Bayero, and scores of other passengers escaped death after the engine of a Max Air aircraft flying the Kano-Abuja route failed. Daily Nigerian reports that the fault was noticed 10 minutes after take-off from the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport. The Max Air plane with number VM1645, scheduled for take-off at 1.30 p.m, had about a 30minutes delay. The aircraft took off around 2:00 pm but, after 10 minutes, began to swerve around the air until a detour for an emergency landing. A passenger, Dr. Samaila Suleiman, accused the Max Air of negligence, recalling that he heard a sound just before the plane took off. “I heard a strange sound during the take-off but brushed it aside. I have used aircraft many times but had never heard such a sound during take-off. “The cabin crew members and the pilot were helpless because they apparently lost control of the aircraft.” Suleiman lamented that no radio announcement was made until the airport landed. “It was a near-death experience. I and many other passengers were traumatised. Many of us cancelled to trip and returned home.” The reaction of Max Air, an indigenous airliner, is being awaited.
