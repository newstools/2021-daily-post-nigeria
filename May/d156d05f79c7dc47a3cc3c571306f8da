The All Progressives Congress has taken over the Secretariat of the People Democratic Party (PDP) in Cross River State. DAILY POST gathered that the property situated at 42A Murtala Muhammed Highway, Calabar, Cross River State is currently being painted with APC colours. In a statement sent to newsmen, the landlord, Lawrence Ene Asuquo, said PDP remains his tenant and he has no dealings with APC. The statement reads: “My attention has been drawn to the fact that the property situated at 42A Murtala Muhammad Highway, Calabar which PDP holds as tenant is presently being painted with APC colours. “On behalf of the Estate of E.A Lawrence and myself as the administrator, I hereby state that, PDP’s tenancy with the family is still subsisting and they remain my legal and recognised tenant. “APC has never approached me for any such agreement so I am surprised to know of this development.” The development came few days after the state Governor, Ben Ayade dumped the PDP for the APC. Defection: Ayade says more Govs will dump PDP soon, lists those to join him in APC
