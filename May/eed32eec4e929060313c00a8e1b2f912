A 28-year-old man, Opeyemi Adeola Ganiyu, is cooling his heels in a police cell for reportedly stabbing his mother-in-law, Abosede Oyewole, to death in Ogun. The suspect was arrested Monday following a report made at Atan Ota divisional headquarters by one Odunayo Mathew. Mathew had reported that the suspect, who was fond of beating his wife on any slight provocation, did so again on Monday, inflicting injuries on her body. It was gathered that the slain mother-in-law had visited her daughter’s husband to warn him against beating his wife. But, “on sighting the deceased in his house, the suspect descended heavily on her, beat her mercilessly before stabbing her on the ribs with a knife. “The woman was rushed to a hospital for treatment, but she gave up the ghost in the process,” Ogun police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST on Wednesday. As he heard about the death of his in-law, the suspect was said to have fled to an unknown destination. Oyeyemi disclosed that the DPO of Atan-Ota division, CSP Abolade Oladigbolu, detailed his detectives to go after him. “The detectives embarked on an intelligence-based investigation, which led them to his hideout in Ikorodu, Lagos State, where he was eventually apprehended,” Oyeyemi said. “Preliminary investigation revealed that the suspect is a member of a notorious cult group in the area. “He was also one of those who led hoodlums to burn down Atan-Ota police division during the EndSARS protest and killed the divisional crime officer on the 21st of October 2020,” the PPRO added. The case is to be investigated at the homicide section of the state CIID as ordered by the State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun
