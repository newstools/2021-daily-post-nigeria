James Oche, the Local Government Area Chairman, confirmed this in a Facebook post on Monday, sharing videos and photos of the incident. The suspected herdsmen were said to have attacked Ndigwe, Ataloga, Odokem, Ekile, Nduobasi, Ekpufu, Obakota and other nearby villages in the LGA. He called on the people of the area to defend themselves, adding that the era of arms folding is over. The LGA boss wrote, “Yesterday, no fewer than 30 Igbo speaking indigenes of Ado Local Government lost their lives to attacks by Fulani herdsmen and their mercenaries on Ndigwe, Ataloga, Odokem, Ekile, Nduobasi, Ekpufu, Obakota and other nearby villages. “We have a situation of nearly 5000 internally displaced persons in addition to the destruction occasioned by the assailants. It took the concerted efforts of Operation Whirlstroke after we informed them, to repel the attacks. “The era of lip service and arms folding is over. The people of Ado must rise up to the occasion in self-defence. In whatever way possible, our people must be empowered to defend themselves. Enough of the killings, we are not cowards.” Video:  Herdsmen killed 55 persons in Yewa – Ogun indigenes tackle Sarkin Fulani
