Manchester United playmaker, Bruno Fernandes, is close to signing a new contract with the club, the UK Mirror report. It will see the Portugal international double his current wages, after he agreed a deal worth £200,000-per-week. Fernandes arrived at Old Trafford in January 2020 and has become one of the club’s most important players. This season, the midfielder leads United’s goal scoring charts with 28 goals and has also provided 18 assists. His current deal still has four years left to run, but United are eager to reward Fernandes after an excellent season where he played a pivotal role in sealing second place in the Premier League. The club is confident of wrapping up Fernandes’ new deal before the Euros start with the midfielder’s agent Miguel Pinto flying into Manchester onto Tuesday to step up talks.
