England manager, Gareth Southgate, has named a 33-man provisional squad for the European Championship. Southgate included Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ben White, Ben Godfrey and Aaron Ramsdale but Eric Dier misses out. Injury doubts like Harry Maguire, Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips make the cut, with the list is expected to be trimmed to 26 players on June 1. Bukayo Saka, Ollie Watkins, Mason Greenwood and 17-year-old Jude Bellingham are among the others to get the nod. Jesse Lingard is in the expanded squad but there is no space for Leeds United’s Patrick Bamford, who scored 17 Premier League goals this season, or Southampton’s Danny Ings. The Three Lions will play Austria on June 2 and Romania on June 6 in warm-up friendly matches, before kicking off their tournament against Croatia on June 13.
