A fight between a couple has led to the death of their two-week-old baby in Ondo State. The incident happened at Eleyowo community, in Akure North Local Government Area of the state. The young couple identified as Ekene Ijokun, 40 and Rose Ijokun, 32, were said to have always engaged in fights. Their neighbours accused Ekene of always beating his wife even during pregnancy. The woman was said to have strapped her baby on her back during the brawl that led to the baby’s death. According to Rose’s sister, Ekene started a verbal attack on his wife before it degenerated into physical combat. “I didn’t see it as anything as they usually have such fight and make amends after. But this time, it was the other way round as the disagreement degenerated into physical combat which eventually claimed the life of the innocent baby.” While emphasizing that the baby was hale and hearty before the incident, Ekene’s in-law disclosed that it was after she removed the baby from Rose back and placed him on the bed that realized the baby was lifeless. She added that efforts to revive the baby proved abortive as he was declared dead on arrival at the Basic Health Centre in the community The traditional head of the community, the Olisa of Eleyowo, Chief Eso Ojo said there had been series of reports about the couple as regards their frequent fights. While appealing for calm over the development, Chief Ojo stated that the case was being handled by the state police command. Newborn baby burnt at refuse dump in Jigawa
