The draw for this year’s CAF Champions League semi-final has been confirmed. Kaizer Chiefs play Wydad Casablanca, with the two teams having already met in the group stages. The South African side progressed despite losing 3-0 to Simba in the quarter-final second-leg clash on Saturday. Chiefs advanced to the last four for the first time in their history, winning the tie 4-3 on aggregate. Wydad secured their place in the last four, after defeating Algerian club MC Alger 2-1 on aggregate in the quarter-finals. Wydad thumped Chiefs 4-0 in a Group C encounter at home in February 2021, but Amakhosi won the reverse fixture 1-0 in Johannesburg last month. The other semi-final tie will be between Al Ahly and Esperance, after they eliminated Mamelodi Sundowns and CR Belouzidad’s respectively. Al Ahly, who are the defending champions, held Sundowns to a 1-1 draw in Pretoria on Saturday and qualified with a 3-1 aggregate. Esperance progressed after seeing off Algerian side CR Belouizdad 3-2 on penalties in Rades on Saturday night following a 2-2 draw on aggregate in their quarter-final tie. The two semi-final matches will be played next month. The first-leg ties are scheduled to take place on June 18/19 and the return leg games will be played June 25/26. The winners will advance to the final which will take place on July 17. Champions League: Money Chelsea were paid for eliminating Real Madrid revealed
