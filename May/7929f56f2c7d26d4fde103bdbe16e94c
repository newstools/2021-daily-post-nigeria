Real Madrid is ready to sell at least eleven players this summer transfer window, according to Diario AS. According to the Spanish newspaper, top of the lists is former Chelsea player, Eden Hazard. Hazard has failed to impress Santiago Bernabeu since joining Real Madrid from Chelsea for £130 million in 2019. The Belgian’s time at Real Madrid has been blighted by injury and fitness concerns. The 30-year-old has played just 40 games in all competitions since joining the Los Blancos. Other Real Madrid players that could be following Hazard out the exit door includes Raphael Varane, Luka Jovic, Marco Asensio, Isco, Mariana Diaz and Borja Mayoral are all likely to be available to the highest bidder. Dani Ceballos, who is currently on loan at Arsenal, and Marcelo are also on the list. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has decimated Spanish football finances this season, but Real Madrid will feel selling some players out will help them through it ahead of next season.
