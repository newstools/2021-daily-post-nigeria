Liverpool hero, Luis Garcia, has backed Chelsea to eliminate Real Madrid and book their place in the UEFA Champions League, UCL, final when both teams clash in the semi-final second-leg tie on Wednesday night at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea and Real Madrid played 1-1 draw in the first-leg encounter at the Alfredo Di Stefano Stadium in Spain last week. But Garcia feels Thomas Tuchel’s side is ‘just too good’ and expects them to face Manchester City in the final later this month. “I still think that Chelsea have got enough and plenty to beat Real Madrid,” Garcia told CBS Sports. “It’ll be a big, big battle between the two teams. Real Madrid played at the weekend against Osasuna, it was not a brilliant game once again, but they managed to score another 2 goals later in the game. “They had a few chances but really struggled to create, even though Hazard was involved. He did play a few good minutes but he was not the Hazard we all know. “But Hazard will be better for the Chelsea game. Kroos and Modric were not involved as they were rested to be ready, very important players. “They’ve got enough, they have got the history, they have got the courage and they know that the big players always show up on the field. “But I think that Chelsea are just too good. Chelsea have intensity, the way they approach these kinds of games… I think they’re good enough to go through to the final and they deserve it because they’ve had an amazing campaign.”
