The Emir of Bauchi, Alhaji Rilwanu Suleiman Adamu, has suspended a member of the House of Representatives, Honourable Yakubu Shehu Abdullahi as the traditional title holder of Wakilin Birnin Bauchi indefinitely. Abdullahi is representing Bauchi Federal Constituency in the lower chamber of the National Assembly on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). His suspension was conveyed to him through a three-paragraph letter, with reference number BEC/ADM/20/VOL.X, dated 16th May, 2021 and signed by the Secretary, Bauchi Emirate Council, Nasiru Musa Maidala. According to the letter, written in Hausa language, which was made available to DAILY POST late Sunday night, the lawmaker was suspended for his “unbecoming behaviour”, which was regarded by the Emirate Council as a disrespect to the Emir of Bauchi, district and village heads, as well as other traditional title holders in the Emirate. “After thorough deliberation by the Emirate Council on your actions which are disrespectful to the Emir of Bauchi, Alhaji Rilwanu Suleiman Adamu, you are hereby suspended as the Wakilin Birnin Bauchi indefinitely until further notice,” Maidala wrote. The emirate council scribe referred to what happened at the Government House, Bauchi, on Saturday during the annual Hawan Daushe held to pay Sallah homage to the state governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, by the Emir and all the traditional rulers in the emirate. Maidala stated in the letter that the Emirate Council faulted Abdullahi’s mode of dressing in the presence of the Emir, district and village heads, as well as other traditional title holders, adding that the council viewed this as a grave misconduct and disrespect to constituted authorities. Meanwhile, efforts made to get the reaction of the lawmaker to the development failed as he neither picked the calls put through to his mobile number nor replied to SMS messages sent to him.
