Senator Shehu Sani, who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th National Assembly, has slammed some Nigerians celebrating the death of the Chief Of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru, who died alongside other top military officers in an air crash on Friday. DAILY POST had reported that the army chief and other top military officers died on Friday evening when a military Beachcraft 350 conveying them crashed at the Kaduna International Airport. While Nigerians mourn the officers, Shehu Sani on his official Facebook page on Saturday alleged that some Nigerians are rejoicing over the ugly incident. He lamented how some elements would celebrate the death of other persons stressing that such people are evil. According to him, “When Abacha died, some people gloated. When the members of the IMN were callously massacred in Zaria, some people celebrated. When Nnamdi Kanu lost his parents, some people were happy. “And now some people are delighted over the tragedy that led to the loss of our gallant officers; Of what use is a mortal rejoicing over the death of another mortal? “Where is our empathy and humanity. Why have we become so evil in life and death”?
