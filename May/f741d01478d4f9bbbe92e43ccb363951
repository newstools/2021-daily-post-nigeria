Derby County, managed by Wayne Rooney, escaped relegation from the Championship on Saturday, after a 3-3 draw with Sheffield Wednesday. The Rams began the day with their destiny in their hands. They fell behind in the first half and looked to be heading to League One for the first time in 35 years. However, having lost their last six games in a row, Derby staged a remarkable fightback in the second half to get enough, which proved enough after Cardiff drew against Rotherham. “It has been a very difficult season for everyone connected to the club. “We need to get everything sorted as soon as possible off the pitch to give ourselves the best chance of moving forward as a club. “It has to start tonight. We have to have positive news and move forward as a club. We cannot have another season like this because it won’t end well. The lads have done everything to make sure it doesn’t this season and I can’t stress enough have good they have been in a very difficult moment,” Rooney told Sky Sports.
