Governor Babagana Zulum returned to Borno State on Wednesday, after his 21-day vacation. Zulum stressed the importance of a cordial relationship between a governor and his deputy to ensure good governance. The Borno helmsman handed over to his deputy, Umar Kadafur, to serve as acting governor, from April 29 to May 19, 2021. In a chat with newsmen, Zulum said he transmitted power to Kadafur to fulfil constitutional requirement and allow him to take full control of government. “He did well in my absence and whenever there is such opportunity I will hand over to him. “I see no reason why I should not trust my deputy”, Zulum said. The governor reiterated his administration’s commitment to the return of peace in the state. On Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), Zulum assured that those occupying schools within Maiduguri would be resettled before the end of the month. He disclosed that completed projects will be inaugurated from next week to mark the May 29 Democracy Day. Borno House of Assembly denies plans to impeach Gov Zulum
