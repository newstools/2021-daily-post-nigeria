Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has denied telling his players that he would leave the club. According to the Frenchman, he “would never, ever say that to my players”. It is believed that Zidane has announced his exit to the squad behind closed doors. Despite beating Athletic Bilbao on Sunday, Real are in danger of finishing 2020/2021 without a trophy, as they remain two points behind Atletico Madrid on the table with one match to go. But Zidane insists they are fully focused on trying to win the title. “How could I tell the players I’m leaving now? We’re giving our everything for the title and I just say ‘by the way, I’m off’? “People outside the club can say whatever they like, but I would never, ever say that to my players,” Zidane told reporters.
