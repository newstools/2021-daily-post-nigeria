Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has claimed this was the hardest title to win, after they were confirmed champions on Tuesday night. Leicester City’s 2-0 win at Old Trafford, means United cannot catch their city rivals again this season. “This has been a season and a Premier League title like no other. “This was the hardest one. We will always remember this season for the way that we won. I am so proud to be the manager here and of this group of players. “To come through this season, with all the restrictions and difficulties we’ve faced — and show the consistency we have is remarkable. It is relentless,” Guardiola said. After joining City in 2016, Guardiola won his first league title and the club finished with a league-record 100 points. City retained their title the next season, finishing on 98 points, one point ahead of Liverpool. Guardiola has previously won the title in La Liga with Barcelona and the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich. EPL: Guardiola reveals points Man City need to be champions amid Man Utd’s fight
