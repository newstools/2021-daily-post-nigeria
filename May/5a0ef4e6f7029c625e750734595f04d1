A Nigerian socio-political activist, Aisha Yusuf has vowed not to link her subscriber identification module (SIM) to her National Identity Number (NIN). DAILY POST recalls that the Federal Government on December 16 2020 ordered all telephone subscribers to link their line with NIN or be blocked. Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami who announced the directive, gave telecoms operators two weeks to link subscribers’ registered SIM cards on their networks to their NIN. Following the instruction, the registration exercise would continue until May 6 according to the Communication Ministry. However, Aisha Yusuf on her Twitter handle on Friday said she would rather be disconnected by the telecom operators than to allow her information controlled by some persons in the ministry. According to her, “Let me repeat categorically what I have said before. I WILL NOT BE LINKING MY NIN to my phone number! “I will rather not have a phone line than willingly give my information and have it in the control of a terrorist sympathiser and his cohorts #PantamiMustGo”.
