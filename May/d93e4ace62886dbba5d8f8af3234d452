She also bit me and in anger, I retaliated and hit her with a stabilizer and she started bleeding. “That was how she died,” he said. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Uduak Akpan, suspected killer of Inioubong Umoren not dead in our custody – Police
