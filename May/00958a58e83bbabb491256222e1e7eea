Chelsea striker, Timo Werner, has made known his final decision on leaving Stamford Bridge this summer. Werner said he has no intention to quit Chelsea this summer despite his struggles in front of goal in his first season for the Blues. The Germany international disclosed this ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League final against Manchester City on Saturday. He scored only six goals in 35 Premier League games for Thomas Tuchel’s side since joining Chelsea from Red Bull Leipzig last summer for £47.5million. “Of course,” Werner told the Daily Telegraph when asked if he wanted to stay at Chelsea beyond this summer. “In terms of scoring and missing chances, it was the worst season. But in the end, I still have 27 goal contributions. “I think I’m the first in our team for that, so it was not everything bad and I don’t think about leaving the club this year, for sure not. “And also for the next year because I think we have a very good team and I hope to come back to scoring and that I can do everything that’s expected of me.” Zidane informs Real Madrid players he will leave this summer
