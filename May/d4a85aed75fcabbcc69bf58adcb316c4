The immediate past Governor of Zamfara State, Alhaji Abdul Aziz Yari has declared that the opposition APC in the State has the financial records and everything in the treasury of Zamfara State Government. He threatened that when the time comes, they would hit the nail on the head by exposing the facts to the public. The former Governor, who made the declaration when he received his former Commissioners, Special Advisers and members of the media for an Iftar in his Talatar Mafara residence, said when the time comes, they would voice out facts for the public to decide. “It is not yet time to play politics hence I have not seen anything good that warrants APC supporters to play politics with. I am assuring that when the time comes Zamfara people shall be well-informed of the happenings in the State,” he said. The former Governor further stated that he and his people were watching things as they unfold and were keenly taking records of what comes into the state and what goes out, adding that the facts shall be laid to the public for their judgement. He enjoined the All Progressives Congress (APC) supporters to continue to pray for return of peace in Zamfara State. Yari also asked them to pray for the continued progress of the APC, noting that as leaders, they would continue to do everything possible to sustain the progress of the party.
