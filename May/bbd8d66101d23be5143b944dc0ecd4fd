Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, on Thursday, blamed Nigeria’s insecurity challenge on the failure of past leaders. Umahi said the failure of past Nigerian leaders to address the future of youths was responsible for the current spate of insecurity. The Chairman of the Southeast Governors Forum disclosed this while appearing on Channels Television’s Politics Today, on Thursday. Umahi, who stressed that Nigerians should not blame the current administration for the spike in insecurity, insisted that the situation was systemic. The governor called for sincerity in the fight against insecurity, if the country is to win the war. He said: “When people talk about the recent insecurity in our country, I keep saying that the insecurity did not just develop overnight. “It has been a result of the failure of our past leaders to address the future of our youths. And this is the truth. So it’s not a question of blaming Mr President or blaming Governors or blaming APC or PDP; it is systematic and it has been there for a very long time. “I think that we must deploy sincerity in our approach; we must deploy consultation, wisdom and prayers. If all these are put together, I am sure that the insecurity in the country will be a thing of the past.”
