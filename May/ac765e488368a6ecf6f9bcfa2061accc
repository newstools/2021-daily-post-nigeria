Chelsea fan, Rory Jennings, has said manager Thomas Tuchel will be sacked by Roman Abramovich, if he does not win silverware and finishes outside the Premier League top four. The Blues lost the first chance to win a trophy last weekend, as they were defeated 1-0 by Leicester City in the FA Cup final. Tuchel’s men will face the Foxes again on Tuesday night, with top four places in contention. Later this month, Chelsea take on Manchester City in the Champions League final. Jennings told MailOnline: “At a crucial time we seem to have either run out of steam or worse his tactics have been found out. Anything other than a win against Leicester is catastrophic. “If Chelsea were to finish fifth with no silverware I think Abramovich sacks him. It’s not a decision I would support but it is a decision that would be in keeping with the way Abramovich chooses to treat people. If you can show such disdain to the man who captained us to European glory then no man is safe.” FA Cup final: Chelsea could end up without trophy – Paul Merson
