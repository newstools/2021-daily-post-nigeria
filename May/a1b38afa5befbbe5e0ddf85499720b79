The Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) and other concerned agencies have been charged to wake up to their responsibilities of ensuring quality standard in the circulation of gas materials to reduce incidents of gas explosion, which is fast turning into a daily occurrence in Ogun State. The Leragun of Igbein, Chief Toyin Amuzu, in a chat with DAILY POST while reacting to the gas explosions, especially Thursday’s explosion at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, asked the SON to act fast to avoid further loss of lives. Amuzu advised Ogun residents to always take extra precautions while purchasing anything that has to do with gas. The community leader said “with the fourth explosion recorded in Abeokuta, barely 48 hours after the gas explosion in Conference Hotel, it is likely that the gas in circulation are either substandard or expired. The SON should swing into action now.” He called on the SON, other concerned government agencies, technicians and professionals to quickly put heads together and devise means of forestalling such occurrences. According to him, “our people, especially regular users of such gas products should be wary of purchasing fake, adulterated or expired gas. The cause could be adulterated oxyacetylene gas in circulation, thus gas consumers should be more conscious”. “People should also avoid gathering in places where such materials are used”, the Egba Chief said. He added that by now, any responsible government should be concerned about saving people’s lives by putting in place measures that will check such occurrences. He commiserated with the families of those affected by the gas explosions, praying God to console them. Ogun explosions: Police commence investigation
