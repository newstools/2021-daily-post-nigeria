The governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma has asked Imo residents to disregard the sit-at-home order given by the leader of Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu on the 30th day of May 2021. The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor of Imo State, Oguwuike Nwachukwu made this known in a press statement. The statement said IPOB does not have the power to ground economic activities in the name of Biafra Day, asking Imo people to go about their normal businesses. It assured that the security agencies have been alerted to provide maximum security across the 27LGAs in Imo State. The release further warned the secessionist group to desist from constituting nuisance and inciting the public. Meanwhile, the Biafran group, through its leader, Nnamdi Kanu had earlier warned the five Southeast states including Imo to observe the sit-at-home order from 6pm to 6pm on 29th to 30th. The group further threatened to deal decisively with violators of the order by coming out on the said day. Meanwhile, some residents of Imo State who spoke to DAILY POST expressed fear over what the day would bring following the threats and bickering between the government and IPOB.
