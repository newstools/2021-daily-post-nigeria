Reno Omokri, former aide to Ex-president Goodluck Jonathan has told President Muhammadu Buhari to consider appointing an Igbo man as a replacement of the late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen Ibrahim Attahiru. DAILY POST had earlier reported the late COAS died in a plane crash close to the Kaduna Airport on Friday. Ten other officers were also killed when the Beachcraft 350 aircraft came down due to bad weather. Buhari is yet to announce a replacement. Reno, on his Twitter page, urged Buhari to appoint an Igbo man to stop the rise of secessionists in the Southeast. According to him, the Buhari-led administration needs to stop being igbophobic and being development to the eastern region rather than guns and bullets. His tweets read: “The best way to fight the rise of secessionists in the Southeast is not with guns, bullets and helicopter gunships. Give them development and stop your nepotism. Be fair and balanced in your appointments. “Consider an Igbo man to replace General Attahiru. Abandon the 97% versus 5% mentality.” Omokri also asked the president to also visit Igbo land and embrace Igbo presidential candidate. “Lose your Igbophobia, Visit each Igbo state (Buhari has not visited Igboland since the 2019 election). Make Igbo monarchs pro-chancellors of federal universities in Northern Nigeria. “Genuinely pursue an extra state for the Southeast in the Constitutional Reform process, so they are equal with other geopolitical zones. Encourage a major political party to consider an Igbo Presidential candidate. Embrace Igbos and Igbos will embrace Nigeria,” Omokri wrote.
