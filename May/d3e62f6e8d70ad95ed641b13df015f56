The family of the arrested 13 suspected Boko Haram members in Hotoro Kano, have cried out that those arrested by the military are genuine businessmen and students and not terrorists as claimed. The Nigerian military had on Saturday said they have arrested about 13 suspected Boko Haram members at Hotoro Kano after intelligence reports on them. However, the family who briefed the media, Monday, said those arrested have no connection whatsoever with the dreaded insurgent group. Abdullahi Ali, spokesperson of the family of those arrested, said for example, Alhaji Usman is the representative of Sheik Ibrahim Saleh who is a renowned Islamic scholar. He said when the military stormed his House after searching the place and they found nothing, the same person asked them to proceed to his other house where they still didn’t find anything, but still, they left with him. “Another person, a chemist at the area, is a student at BUK and he had nothing to do with Boko Haram.” To this end the spokesperson of the suspects, appealed to the military to hasten their investigation on them and possibly take them to court. “We are praying that our brothers would be taken to court after all possible investigations on them, so that justice will be served on them.” Army raids mosque in Kano, arrests 10 suspected Boko Haram militants
