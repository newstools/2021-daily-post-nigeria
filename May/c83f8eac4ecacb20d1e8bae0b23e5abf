The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State has described the boast of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the State that it will win the next gubernatorial election as fallacy, deceptive and a figment of their imagination. In a statement from the party’s Directorate of Publicity, Research and Strategy, signed by its Director, Barr Kunle Oyatomi and made available to DAILY POST in Osogbo, the party said that Osun PDP and its agents were on a frolic mission and their dream can be best described as mirage. The APC claimed that the achievements made by the Gboyega Oyetola administration in the last 30 months had drained the PDP in the State to the extent that only few expired politicians were left in the already dead party. According to Oyatomi, “Osun PDP is cancerous and it is beyond radiotherapy and it will be foolhardy for the cancerous PDP to deploy an already dead structure against the highly spirited Osun APC in the forthcoming gubernatorial election. “It is no longer news to the entire people of Osun that PDP is an evil, welfare parasite and harbinger of lawless people who know nothing but treasury looting. “Those who have eyes to see clearly, ears to hear and a conscience to acknowledge facts will agree that there is tremendous progress in Osun State and it is visible. “The State is safe in the hands of Governor Oyetola APC-led administration.” He explained that what had been put into the social and economic engineering in Osun was progressive, adding that any honest social observer would acknowledge the physical transformation that had taken place in the last 30 months of the administration.
