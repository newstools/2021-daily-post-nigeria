A chieftain of the Taraba State chapter of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Jacob Gbadede and the Taraba Central Concern Group (TCCG), have faulted Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku, for abandoning Tarabans to their fate while the state is on fire. Gbadede said that the governor, instead of wading in to halt further killings and destruction of property that characterized the ongoing fracas between herders and farmers, left for Kaduna State to “attend a wedding.” The APC chieftain believed that Ishaku is not doing “enough to protect the lives and property of the people of the state.” Expressing his dismay during an interactive session with media practitioners in Jalingo the state capital Gbadede, on Monday, charged the governor to rise up to his responsibility by ending the ongoing killings in the different parts of the state. The governor, according to him “ought to have empathized with the people and take concrete steps to address the killings before jetting out of Taraba for a wedding party in Kaduna.” “While the state is on fire” the governor, as stated by him “was busy attending a wedding in Kaduna state” adding that the duty of “every responsible government was the protection of lives and property of citizens.” Stressing that “this responsibility can not be ignored by any leader” he tenaciously affirmed that “once you are a governor, you have the responsibility to protect not only your tribal people, but all citizens.” “For the number one citizen of the state to “leave the state without taking steps to stop the killings, according to him ” is most unfortunate and does not reflect the qualities of a good leader.”Ishaku
