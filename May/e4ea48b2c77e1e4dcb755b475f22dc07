Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has expressed doubt that Sergio Aguero will be fit in time for the Champions League final. Guardiola is hoping the striker recovers from injury, so he can bid farewell to the fans on the last day of this Premier League campaign. Aguero, who has missed much of the season recovering from a knee injury before testing positive for COVID-19, was unavailable for the win over Newcastle on Friday night. The 32-year-old will leave City at the end of the season as a free agent and is in a race to be fit for the final home match against Everton, when 10,000 fans are expected at the Etihad Stadium. “If Sergio is fit he is going to help us, that is for sure. “If he is going to help us score goals he is going to play, but it’s the final of the Champions League. “I have to take the decision that gives us the best chance of winning that game,” Guardiola said.
