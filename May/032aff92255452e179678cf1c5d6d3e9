Following the attack on the State Criminal Investigation Department in Umuagu Umuahia, Abia State, on Saturday, the Commissioner of Police, Janet Agbede, has said no fewer than eight of the attackers, suspected to be members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Eastern Security Network (ESN), were killed. DAILY POST reported that unknown gunmen had razed the Umuagu Police station in Umuahia North Local Government area of the state. As at the time of our earlier report, on Saturday, it could not be confirmed if any casualty was recorded during the unwarranted attack on the police formation. However, briefing newsmen in Umuahia on Sunday on behalf of the Commissioner of Police, the Public Relations Officer of Abia Command, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, confirmed the killing of two Inspectors by the yet to be identified gunmen. The Police Commissioner said the attackers had stormed the police formation at about 6pm on Saturday, shooting sporadically. According to CP Agbede, a reinforcement from the command headquarters added to the fierce engagement with men on ground saw eight of the hoodlums neutralised. She added that some of the attackers escaped with gunshot wounds while two vehicles were recovered. The facility, the Police boss said, was burnt down following the detonation of an explosive through the back of the building. While stating that the suspects in detention were released and an exhibit car burnt, Agbede said no fire arm was carted away. She therefore urged medical facilities within and outside the state to report to security agencies in the event that patients with suspected bullet wounds come for treatment. The Commissioner further appealed to parents and guardians to warn their children and wards to desist from acts capable of truncating the peace and security of the state, describing it as a whirlwind that will blow no one good.
