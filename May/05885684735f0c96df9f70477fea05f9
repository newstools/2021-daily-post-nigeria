There is an ongoing process at the Ilorin Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, to create a tax fraud desk for Kwara State. Head of the zonal office, Usman Muktar, revealed this in Ilorin, during a visit to his office by a delegation of the Kwara state Internal Revenue Service, KWIRS, led by the chairman, Shade Ominiyi. Muktar, said when created, the tax fraud desk, in conjunction with the Special Control Unit against money laundering, would greatly help in dealing with issues of corruption, tax evasion, illicit financial flows and money laundering within the state. The zonal head promised to support the revenue agency in achieving its mandate. Earlier, the chairman of the revenue agency, decried the rate of tax evasion in the state describing it as an economic crime. “We are here to seek your support in tackling the menace of tax evasion in Kwara State. “We need the support of relevant government agencies like the EFCC to curb tax evasion in the public and private sectors within the state,” Ominiyi stated. She solicited the support of the anti-graft agency in dealing with the increasing rate of tax evasion in the state, saying the government could not properly provide the needed infrastructure when citizens and corporate organisations refuse to pay tax. “We look forward to strengthening our relationship with EFCC in the area of gathering intelligence about tax payers and enforcement of relevant laws,” the chairman of the agency added.
