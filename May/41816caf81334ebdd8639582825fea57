A former Real Madrid striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Manchester City to beat PSG 2-0 when both teams clash in tonight’s Champions League semi-final second-leg tie at Etihad. Owen expects Man City to beat PSG by 2-0 in England and qualify for the Champions League final. Man City had defeated PSG 2-1 in the first-leg in Paris last week. Providing his prediction, Owen told BetVictor, “The first of the UEFA Champions League semi-final return legs comes from the Etihad as Manchester City welcome PSG. “The Citizens left Paris with a hard-fought victory last week, with two goals inside ten second-half minutes, putting the tie firmly in their grasp. “That said, there is still work to be done. PSG have already shown how clinical they can be on the road, scoring four at the Nou Camp and another three in Munich. “I think City will approach this carefully. They know full well that eventually, PSG will have to go for it, and if that materialises, I think City have more than enough to punish the visitors on the counter. Manchester City 2, PSG 0.” The kick-off time for the game is 8 pm.
