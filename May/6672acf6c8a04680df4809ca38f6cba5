The General Overseer of Omotosho Tope Joseph (OTJ) Ministries has predicted the outcome of the upcoming governorship election in Anambra State. In a statement he made available to DAILY POST on Tuesday, the cleric said he was speaking God’s mind on the gubernatorial election that comes up in November 2021. He said that victory is between candidates of the People Democratic Party (PDP) and All progressive grand alliance (APGA) According to him, APGA will pull the crowd if they present Hon. Chukwuma Umeoji as the candidate but added that the PDP stands a better chance if they present Godwin Maduka as the candidate. Speaking further, Omotosho said that the candidate of the Young People Party, YPP, Ifeanyi Ubah, is the candidate that can shake the ground for the party but he will not win. He stated that the All Progressives Congress, APC, will want to present Chief George Moghalu, but added that the hand of the Lord is not on him.. The clergyman pointed out the governorship election will be very tough, adding, “If APGA wants to win the election, they should use Chukwuma Umeoji.” He said if the ruling party presents any other candidate, “PDP will win the election.”
