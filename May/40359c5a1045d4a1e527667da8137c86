The Idoo community in Egbedore Local Government Area of Osun State has described as shocking and a sad loss the death of its illustrious son, Sergeant Opeyemi Adesina, in a plane crash that also claimed the lives of Chief of Army Staff (COAS), other officers and crew members on Friday, at the Kaduna International Airport. Describing the demise of Sergeant Adesina as a colossal loss not only to the Idoo community but also to the state and Nigeria as a whole, the community said the deceased would be missed by all. Sergeant Adesina, who is popularly called Opeyemi by members of his community, is from Balogun’s compound in Idoo and he died about three weeks after his daughter’s dedication. The spokesman of the community, Alhaji Akanni Olohunlomerue, in a statement, described Sergeant Adesina as “a good boy” who will be missed by the community. While praying for the repose of the soul of the deceased, the community leader also prayed to God to give the families of other dead victims the fortitude to bear the loss of their loved ones. It would be recalled that Sergeant Adesina and 10 others including the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Attahiru, died in the ill-fated Beechcraft 350 that crashed in Kaduna on Friday. Confirming the incident, the Army said the COAS was en route Kaduna from Abuja on Friday when the unfortunate incident occurred. They were buried on Saturday at the Military Cemetery in Abuja. Attahiru, who was appointed Chief of Army Staff on January 26, 2021, succeeded Tukur Buratai. Kaduna crash: Bodies of dead Christian military officers arrive Protestant Church
