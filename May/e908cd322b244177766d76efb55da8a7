Archbishop Emeritus, his Eminence John Cardinal Onaiyekan has accused the federal government of not doing enough. Onaiyekan made the remark while urging the government at all levels to support a national dialogue that tilted toward restoring peace, development and sanity in Nigeria, NAN reports. The clergyman, who made the call at an interactive session with Catholic Action and Catholic Political Stakeholders in Abuja, on Thursday, warned against war in Nigeria. He stressed that the government should give Nigerians a forum to dialogue. Onaiyekan said nobody gains anything during conflicts or war. He stressed that society’s problems would not be solved by war, noting that it will only escalate. “You do not win wars because you are right. War is not a way to fight for Justice. It is always a possibility to discuss it. Dialogue is very important. A lot of our issues can be solved by talking. “We are all complaining that the government is not doing enough, of course, the government can fail if the foundation is not strong. “We do not have to continue that way, we can improve. That is why we are meeting so we can do things as it should be done,” he said. Resign, Nigeria boiling – Archbishop Chukwuma to Buhari
