Paul Merson has warned that Thomas Tuchel and his Chelsea side may end up without a silverware this season ahead of their FA Cup final clash against Leicester City. Merson said that Tuchel’s tinkering has handed Leicester City a huge advantage ahead of the Wembley showdown on Saturday. With one eye on the FA Cup final, Tuchel made seven changes to his team for the midweek Premier League clash with Arsenal. Chelsea lost the game and the German tactician admitted later that he had made a mistake in making so many changes to his regular starting XI. Going into the FA Cup final on Saturday, Merson warned that the Londoners could struggle to rediscover their rhythm on the big stage. “Chelsea go into the FA Cup final with everything up in the air again after what happened against Arsenal. “Tuchel made too many changes in that game. He said so himself. And it backfired. I thought it was extraordinary. “You’ve come this far. Play your best team. The name of the game was to get a top four spot sewn up before the final. ‘Instead, he made loads of changes, they lost, and the door is now open again for the teams who are chasing them down.” Chelsea face Manchester City in the Champions League final and Merson warned that more changes during the final games of the season could leave the Blues with nothing. “I know you have to try and keep people fresh and it’s been a long season but in a big game like that, you have to play your best team. “Chelsea could end up with two trophies and a top four finish this season. Or they could end up with nothing. It’s all on a knife-edge, and they’ve put themselves under pressure.” Champions League final: Tuchel told not to play Chelsea star against Man City
