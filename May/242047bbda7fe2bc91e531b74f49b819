Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has said that his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will suffer if he leaves for another party. Wike made the assertion on Monday while briefing newsmen in Government House, Port Harcourt the state’s capital. DAILY POST reports that the governor’s claim is coming barely one week after his Cross River counterpart, Ben Ayade dumped the part for the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. The governor also claimed that he would win election in any party he joins, stressing that PDP in Rivers State lack political detractor. Governor Wike, who described himself as asset to the national opposition party, accused some members of the PDP’s National Working Committee (NWC) of been “tax collectors”. He said, “If I leave PDP tomorrow, the party will suffer… Some members of PDP NWC are tax collectors. I did not say that all the members of NWC are tax collectors but some of them and I stand by my words. “Babangida Aliyu is a mole in PDP. They get information from the PDP and send it to the ruling party. I am an asset to PDP if I leave the party today I will win election in any party I find myself. There is no political detractor in Rivers PDP as long as the party is concerned. If there is any State PDP is sure of winning election, it’s Rivers State. Aliyu is a political liability to PDP. “He is not an asset. He once said that the northern governors worked against Jonathan but some of the former PDP governors from the north denied it. I want to tell you that Aliyu opposed the election of Secondus as the National Chairman of PDP only to turn round to support Secondus when he was coasting to victory. How can a man who cannot organise ordinary Congress in his State ask PDP National Working Committee, NWC to suspend me?” Ayade: PDP dissolves, replaces Cross River State Caretaker Committee
