Prof. Yohana Izam, the Vice-Chancellor, Plateau State University, Bokkos, has announced the release of a kidnapped student, Stanley Showul-Mushi. Showul-Mushi, a final year accounting undergraduate, was snatched on Thursday. The VC told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that he was freed by his captors Friday evening. Izam commended security operatives for the operation and reminded students to minimise their off-campus late evening and night movement. ”The university axis from Bokkos through Diram and Ndar has been infiltrated by merchants of crime who cash in on the vulnerability of the largely defenceless students’ population”, Izam said. Showul-Mushi was returning to the campus from Bokkos town when the incident happened. The kidnappers took N3,000 from him and used his Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card to withdraw money. On April 23, the Police confirmed that bandits’ attempt to kidnap some female students of Plateau State University failed. Public Relations Officer, ASP Gabriel Ubah said the criminals attacked the Mbar community in Bokkos. “Some students lost their phones to the assailants, while a male student was shot, treated in a hospital and discharged”, Ubah added. Bentse Pamson, ASUU Chairman in the university, then called for more security around the institution. Pamson said it was part of the union’s demand during a meeting with the state government in February. Plateau Varsity students protest alleged rape of four female students
