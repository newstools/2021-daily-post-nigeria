The National Youth Service Corps has announced that henceforth, no corps member will be deployed to any area that is facing security threat. NYSC Director-General, Brig Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim, said this on Tuesday at the 2021 Batch ‘A’ Pre-Orientation Workshop held in Karu, Nasarawa State. He noted that this will take effect during its forthcoming 2021 Batch A Stream Two Orientation Course. “As the welfare and safety of corps members and staff is part of the policy thrust of my administration, we shall continue to work closely with relevant shareholders to evolve strategies for the protection of all corps members and the entire corps community during the orientation course,” he added. NYSC added that the scheme is working with the security agencies and would not undermine the safety of any corps member. THe NYSC DG also revealed that the scheme plans to increase camp capacity while still observing COVID-19 protocols across the country. “We worked closely with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and state ministries of health. “We would use the opportunity of the workshop to, among other things, harness our experiences and explore the prospect of increasing camp capacity, without losing sight of the need to strictly obey COVID -19 safety protocols, as we learn to operate optimally under the ‘new normal.”
