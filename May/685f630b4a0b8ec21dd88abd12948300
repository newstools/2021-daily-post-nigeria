It was on the 19th of March, 2020 that I participated in a Webinar titled, “How to invest in a crisis” by Robert Kiyosaki, a US-based multimillionaire property and business guru, where he narrated how he made money buying property during the financial crisis of 2008 that affected many countries. He went further to explain how he invested massively when a lot of people were afraid of investment. He noted that in any business, not just real estate, when there is a perceived crisis a lot of people will be naïve making investments but that is when the market will reward the few who may exhibit the courage to invest. In Nigeria there are lots of opportunities especially in real estate but many people are yet to recognise that while some are busy disseminating sentiment, that because there is increase insecurity in the country it is not the right time to invest but in business the reverse is actually the case. SME Property and Business Limited, in the spirit of Sallah, presents the opportunity for those interested in real estate to invest. We are giving out only two properties at a reduced price for two lucky people. One is a carcass (already at roofing level) comprising 6 shops, 3 set of one-bedroom flat and 3 set of self-contain with borehole already built located at Karu, very close to New Nyanya junction, Nasarawa state for 7.8 million naira.
