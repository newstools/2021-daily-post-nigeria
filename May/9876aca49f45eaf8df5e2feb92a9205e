The father of Priscilla Ojong, a 300 Level Mass Communication student of the University of Cross River State who was declared missing, has come out to speak. Priscilla was reported missing by her friends days ago after she travelled outside the State to see a friend. According to Mr. Ernest Ojong, his daughter is still missing and has not made any contact with her family members for over three weeks now. Ojong in an interview with Cross River Watch TV, said the last time he communicated with his daughter was in April via text and that he has not heard from her since then. ”I am Ernest Ojong by name. Priscilla is my daughter. ”It has been up to a month that I spoke with her via text message,” he said. Reacting to the video Priscilla shared two days ago dismissing claims that she was missing, Mr Ojong said the number used to send the video was hidden. He further called on the government and the police to help him rescue his daughter. ”The video, they are hiding number to call so I am not sure. That is why I want the government to help me and the police to find her,” he said.
