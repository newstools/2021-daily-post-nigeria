There is a feeling within the Real Madrid dressing room, that manager Zinedine Zidane will not be in charge next season, Goal reports. There are fears Zidane may walk away from the final year of his contract. The feeling inside the Madrid camp is that the Frenchman has grown tired of dealing with events outside of his control. Los Blancos have found themselves fighting on multiple fronts â€“ from injuries, to a hectic schedule and regular rounds of criticism. Matters have now come to a head following a disappointing Champions League semi-final exit at the hands of Chelsea. It is believed Zidane no longer has the full support of some of his big-name players, with the likes of Marcelo and Isco growing disillusioned with being on the fringes of the fold.
