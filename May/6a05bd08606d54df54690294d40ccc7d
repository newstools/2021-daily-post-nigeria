Bishop Ayodeji Ipinmoroti, the General Overseer of Christ Revelation Church of God (Holy Promise), says former Lagos Governor Bola Tinubu will be president in 2023. The cleric said God showed him that the All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader will succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. Ipinmoroti spoke at a sermon to commemorate the Children National, The Nation reports. Noting that Tinubu will emerge victorious, he predicted many of the politician’s associates would betray him before the elections. “I do not see Nigeria breaking apart. Bola Tinubu is a right peg in the right hole in the 2023 presidential election.” Ipinmoroti described the APC stalwart as a man of integrity with administrative experience and political wherewithal. “Don’t be deceived, Tinubu is the only candidate at this point of political, social and psychological turmoil that can fix the near broken down of the structure called Nigeria. “I will explain some mysteries to him. If Tinubu is interested in the race, let the contest. I can assure you he will win the election as God had shown me.” Ipinmoroti added that he believed Tinubu will give to Nigeria, the genuine merit to rescue the sinking boat of the nation from capsizing.
