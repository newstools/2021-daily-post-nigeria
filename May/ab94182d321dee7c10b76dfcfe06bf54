Rochas Okorocha, Imo West Senator, has dismissed claims of the state Governor, Hope Uzodinma, that he opted out of the All Progressives Congress (APC) membership registration and revalidation exercise in the state. Okorocha described Uzodinma’s claim as false and laughable. Uzodinma had informed the APC’s appeal committee on the party’s registration and revalidation exercise that the lawmaker had refused to be registered as an APC member in Imo during the exercise. Reacting, the former Imo State governor said Uzodinma’s claim was more of propaganda. The lawmaker, who spoke through his Media Adviser, Sam Onwuemeodo, insisted that the revalidation exercise did not take place in the state. A statement by Onwuemeodo said: “I needed to revalidate his membership of APC and not to register as APC member. Governor Uzodimma has always delighted in propaganda that does not fly again. “It was done at the Nick Banquet Hall in Government House, Owerri. The Governor’s appointees were generating fictitious names at the Local Government level and taking them to the Government House, to be enrolled. “We challenge the Governor to tell the public how the exercise was carried out in Imo. Whether it was by polling unit by polling unit, like Okorocha did when APC anchored. Or, Ward by Ward or by Local Government by Local Government. And let’s take off from there. “If Okorocha had refused to be registered like our Governor had claimed, what happened to Senator Ifeanyi Araraume and his Destiny Political family, who produced Six House of Assembly members, that joined others to give Governor Uzodinma the Majority in the House?” Okorocha urged Uzodinma to toll the path of reconciliation and restitution. “What Governor Uzodinma needs to do now is to take the paths of reconciliation, restitution, peace and tolerance. The Governor cannot continue to exercise undue Political muscle or glory on needless propaganda,” he added. EFCC releases Ex-Imo Gov, Okorocha
