Tottenham’s Harry Kane has collected his third Premier League Golden Boot ahead of Liverpool winger, Mohammed Salah. Both players went into the last games of the season on Sunday level on 22 goals. But Kane grabbed his 23rd in the first half of their game at Leicester City. Kane won back-to-back Golden Boots in the 2015/16 and 2016/17 campaigns, but Salah won it in the next two seasons. The pair both lost to Leicester’s Jamie Vardy last season. Salah had several chances to add to his tally against Crystal Palace at Anfield. But Kane fired home for Spurs to make it 2-2, in what could be his last match for the North London side. Champions League: Zidane reacts to Salah’s desire to join Real Madrid
