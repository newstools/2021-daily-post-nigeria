Embattled Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju James, popularly known as Baba Ijesha, has said Adeshina Ogunlana, a former Chairman of Ikeja Branch of Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) is not his counsel. In a copy of the disclaimer, made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Lagos, James said that he never briefed Ogunlana to be his legal representative. “I wish to state categorically and emphatically that I have never briefed the lawyer nor instructed him to act on my behalf in any way, or manner howsoever and whatsoever. “He (Ogunlana) is not my lawyer, and whatever you heard or hear from him concerning my lawyers, the police or court case, does not represent the true position. “He has been acting without my knowledge or consent,” he said. The actor is being detained by the police for alleged sexual assault and defilement of the 14-year-old foster daughter of comedienne, Princess. He was granted bail by a magistrate on Monday in spite of a strike by judiciary workers. “Baba Ijesha” said in the disclaimer that the police never demanded money from him for the bail, which was granted him by a magistrate on health grounds. “This is aside the N500,000 refundable bail bond which formed part of my bail conditions ordered by the court. “The bail bond is payable to the court registry’s account and not the police account,” he said.
