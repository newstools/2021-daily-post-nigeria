The Edo State Police Command has arrested three suspected cultists in connection with Tuesday’s shooting at the Peoples Democratic party (PDP) secretariat in the Egor Local Government Area of the state. The incident has been linked to one Olaye, who is believed to be a major actor in the crisis. The embattled Chairman of the party in the Local Government, Chief Idehen Ekundayo, had petitioned Edo State Commissioner of police, alleging threat to his life. He also alleged in the petition that he lost valuable items including his beads worth N700,000, stolen by hoodlums, over a crisis caused by a battle for control in the State Chapter ahead of the 2023 general elections. Spokesman of the police in the state, SP. Kotongs Bello who confirmed the incident to DAILYPOST, said no life was lost during the melee, but police recovered ammunitions from one of the suspects. He revealed the identities of the suspected cultists as Mr. Enofe Maris (38), Mr. Efosa Ezomo (43), and one Mr. Ikpomwonsa (50). Kotongs assured the suspects would be charged to court when investigation is completed. “We heard that some suspected cultists were causing unrest at the party secretariat and we mobilised our men and arrested one Enofe Maris (38) years and three others. When a search was conducted on him immediately, two live cartridges were recovered from Enofe. Anambra Police arrest two persons involved in Sunday morning cult shootings in Awka
