Isah Gambo confirmed the report of the attack and the killing of Alhaji Haasan but cast doubt on whether people were abducted. “It is true they killed one Alhaji Hassan. ” We cannot ascertain whether they abducted people or not and if they abducted them, they (residents) should have come up with the names,” he said. State Assembly lawmaker, representing Batsari constituency, Hon. Jabiru Yusuf Yau-yau, equally confirmed the development. ” They killed one Mallam Hassan Bako-zago and kidnapped many other people.
