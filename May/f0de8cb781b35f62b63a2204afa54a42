England senior national team handler, Gareth Southgate, has revealed when he expects Tottenham’s striker, Harry Kane to leave the club. The future of the England striker has been the subject of much speculation, but his national team coach does not think the player will leave Tottenham before the end of the Euro 2021 tournament. Southgate, who named the centre-forward in his 36-man provisional squad, insists the speculation surrounding the prolific striker will not be an issue during the tournament. “I don’t need to talk about Harry’s focus. He has got one goal with us and that’s to win a European Championship,” Southgate told the press while explaining some decisions about his squad. “What is going on at his club is a matter for him and Tottenham. He has made some statements in the last few days but that is out of the way now and I think it is very unlikely transfer deals will be done while we are away. “We are not going to stop phone ringing and cannot control conversations going on in private. Most deals are done after tournaments or in the September, I would expect any deals to be done after the tournament.” Gareth Southgate names best five strikers
