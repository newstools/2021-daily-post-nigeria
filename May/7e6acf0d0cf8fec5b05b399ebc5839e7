The Senior Pastor of Dunamis Church International Gospel Church, Pastor Paul Enenche has declared that terrorists disturbing the peace of the country will soon waste themselves while the nation watches. In a video posted on his verified Facebook page on Friday, the renowned gospel preacher in series of prophecies on May 5, 14 and 19, said forces against the country would soon eradicate themselves via face-off. He said those sponsoring the terrorists will soon be attacked by their loyalists (terrorists). DAILY POST reports that the church, on May 5, embarked on a three-day fast and prayer against the worsening security situation in the country. He said, “When two forces jam, the superior force must prevail. Their weapons turning against each other has just started. “That day, I told you that they will soon turn against their sponsors. They will soon look for their sponsors and waste them one by one. “I don’t like mentioning their names so that I won’t dignify them. In this season their clashes will become endless. “They will be wasting themselves and the nation, the military will be watching.” DAILY POST recalls that Shekau reportedly killed himself during a battle of supremacy against the Islamic State West African Province, (ISWAP) a group that broke out of Boko Haram in 2016 to align with ISIS
