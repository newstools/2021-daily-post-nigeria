Former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, says the death of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, and 10 others in an air mishap in Kaduna on Friday is a tragic, unspeakable loss for the nation. He said Nigerians must collectively finish the job they died by defeating security challenges. The All Progressives Congress (APC) leader, in a statement, said Attahiru and others dedicated their careers, and now their very lives, in the service of this nation. He noted that Attahiru had a most distinguished career, and that the Army and the nation will miss his excellent character and fine leadership. The politician regretted the COAS died at a moment Nigerian is are fighting terrorism or banditry in many parts of the nation. “Their untimely and sad departure hurts. However, we owe it to them and to the nation to gather our strength and fortitude. We must gird ourselves that we finish the job to which they dedicated and gave their lives.” He advised Nigerians to remember the brave patriots not with tears but by achieving victory over the terrorism and violence that seek to rob our nation of its finest destiny. “Let this unfortunate accident not deter us but spur us and our valiant military to continue to defend this land from violence and evil. “We owe them a debt a gratitude that we can never truly repay except by defeating the violent challenges that now confront us.” Tinubu added that the tragedy reminds everyone of the great patriotism of the brave men and officers who put their lives at risk in defence of our fatherland.
