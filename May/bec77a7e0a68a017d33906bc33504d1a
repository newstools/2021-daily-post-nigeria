Barcelona are set to complete the signing of three players this week. According to Cat Radio, the Barcelona board plans to finalize three transfers in the coming days, consisting of Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero, Lille’s Memphis Depay, and Manchester City’s Eric Garcia. Aguero, Depay and Garcia will all arrive at Barcelona on a free transfer. Aguero has been linked to Barcelona since he announced that he would not renew his contract with Manchester City some weeks ago. Man City manager, Pep Guardiola, also confirmed that Aguero would join Barcelona following their 5-0 victory against Everton on Sunday. Depay and Garcia have been linked with Barcelona for almost a year now. Both players were very close to signing for the Camp Nou club in the last transfer window as well. Meanwhile, Barcelona are keen to bolster their squad this summer after failing to win the LaLiga title this season. Barcelona president, Joan Laporta and manager, Ronald Koeman have also expressed that the club needs quality players in different areas across the pitch ahead of next season.
