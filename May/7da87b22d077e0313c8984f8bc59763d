The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has informed Nigerians that Peter Akpanke is no longer its staff. EFCC Head of Media, Wilson Uwujaren, in a statement said Akpanke has no authority to represent or carry out any business in the name of the commission. Uwujaren noted that the disclaimer became necessary following reports that Akpanke, who was dismissed from the agency, had been parading himself as a bona fide operative. The spokesman said the former employee was “using false identity to harass and extort unsuspecting members of the public especially in Akwa Ibom and Cross River States”. The commission advised members of the public to desist from relating with Akpanke or according him any privilege due to an officer of the law. The statement urged them to report any further solicitations from Akpanke to the nearest EFCC office or police station.
