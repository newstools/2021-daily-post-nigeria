The All Progressives Congress (APC) has denied releasing a timetable for its Congresses and National Convention. John Akpanudoedehe, National Secretary APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) said this in a statement on Monday. “Our attention has been drawn to obviously coordinated and syndicated misinformation being circulated in some sections of the media on purported plans and timetable for Congresses and National Convention of the APC. “This is the handiwork of political jobbers parading themselves as media sources. “The media, party members and indeed the general public should be wary and completely disregard the misinformation, antics and schemes of these fifth columnists,’’ Akpanudoedehe said. He said the APC had never lied about its activities and had no reason to lie. Akpanudoedehe said the consultative leadership style instituted by Gov. Mai Mala Buni led CECPC had institutionalised the APC as a party of processes and internal democracy. He said the committee was focused on delivering its mandate to recover, rebuild and reposition the APC ahead of the 2023 polls. Akpanudoedehe said the committee was also focused on achieving peace and ensuring true reconciliation within the party to give a sense of belonging to all members.
