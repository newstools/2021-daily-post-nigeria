The Lagos State Police Command has arrested one Ibeh George Udoka for driving away his principalâ€™s car to Imo State for sale. Muyiwa Adejobi, Public Relations Officer, in a statement on Thursday said on May 4, one Mrs Akinola Ibironke reported the matter to the Idimu Police Division. She had asked Udoka to take the Toyota Corola, Reg No. ABC 801 FU, to her mechanic for repairs on May 3. The suspect was not seen since then and his phone number remained switched off. The Police personnel at Idimu relayed repeated radio messages to all police formations across the country for recovery of the vehicle. After receiving the signal, the officers in Edo State stayed alert and on May 6, Udoka was intercepted with the car somewhere in Benin, the capital. Operatives from Lagos then moved to the Edo State Command where they took possession of the car and suspect. The Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu has applauded the synergy between the formations. Odumosu directed that the matter be thoroughly investigated and the suspect prosecuted.
