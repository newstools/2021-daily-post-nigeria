Students of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB) on Monday protested the abduction of their colleague, Toyinbo Olayinka. DAILY POST reports that Olayinka, a 400-level student of Aquaculture and Fisheries Management, was kidnapped Saturday, alongside a farmer and one other.  The Ogun State police spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi confirmed the incident to newsmen on Sunday. On Monday morning, the students, in solidarity with their colleague, stormed the entrance of the university in their numbers. They were seen bearing placards with inscriptions like “Free Olayinka now”, “Na book I come read, I no come pay ransom”, “Maximum security is not negotiable” and others. While chanting and dancing, they demanded the immediate release of Olayinka, asking the government to do the needful.  The final-year student was reportedly taken away at a farm at Abule-Itoko on the Abeokuta-Ibadan Road, Odeda Local Government Area of Ogun. The abductors, it was gathered, have reportedly contacted the wife of the farm manager, demanding N50m ransom each for the three abductees.
