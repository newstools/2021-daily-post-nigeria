The senior pastor of Awaiting the Second Coming of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has said that there is joy in dying in Christ rather than dying without the knowledge of God. Giwa said this in reaction to the death of Pastor Dare Adeboye, son of the general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Pastor Enoch Adeboye, who died on Wednesday. In a sermon on Sunday, the cleric said God’s way was greater than man’s way and that Adeboye’s son had gone back to his creator. “On behalf of my family and the church of God, let me urge our father in the Lord, Pastor Enoch Adeboye to be strong, and let his heart take courage. “God’s way is not man’s way, the earth is the Lord’s and everything in it. The greatest joy is that Pastor Dare Adeboye died in Christ. “Dying without Christ is the most foolish decision on the earth. Anybody who dies in Christ will live with Him” COVID-19: ‘You’ll kill me first before I take vaccine’ – Pastor Giwa
