A fresh crisis is brewing in the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja South as Area Council’s elections hold soon. The race for the APC ticket for the Gwagwalada Area Council is currently between the incumbent Vice Chairman, Kasim Muhammad and former Chairman, Abubakar Jibrin Giri. According to insiders, the party’s primary on the 23rd of April, 2021 was postponed due to violence. Speaking with DAILY POST under the condition of anonymity, an insider blamed the Minister of FCT (State), Ramatu Aliu for the ongoing crisis. According to the source, the Vice Chairman is “75% sure of decamping to the Peoples Democratic Party” if the leadership of the APC fails to do justice to the ongoing primary. “We have Plan B, and I can assure you, talk is ongoing as we are speaking. The FCT Minister (State) thinks she can use the influence of national support because of her status, while that can work at the primary level, at the general elections, we will know who is on the ground,” the source said. Speaking on the Minister, the source revealed that the Minister who is a resident of Gwagwalada Area Council, even though she represents Kogi State at the Federal Executive Council is setting her eyes on the FCT Senate seat in 2023. The source noted that the current move is part of the larger political move for the 2023 elections. Zakari Angulu, a former member of the House of Representatives and godfather to the incumbent Chairman, Adamu Mustapha is believed to be eyeing the Senate seat also. Angulu was defeated during the 2019 election. While the incumbent Chairman has his eyes set on the Green Chamber. It is unclear if the Chairman will be following his Deputy to the PDP. Although, the Area Council has a long history of carpet crossing.
