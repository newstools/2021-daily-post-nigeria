The University of Ibadan/Tai Solarin College of Education (UI/TASCE) 2006 Alumni Association wants justice in the death of its late member, Michael Olusegun Odukomaiya. Francis Nwapa, the President, and Daniel Salami, the Secretary, made the demand in a statement on Friday. The association condemned the May 1 brutal killing of Odukomaiya by suspected herdsmen in Ogun. The deceased left his home in Ikorodu, Lagos, for an appointment in Ibadan, the Oyo capital, but had his journey and life cut short. Around 6:10p.m., Odukomaiya drove into an ambush in Ishara in Ogun, a spot known for attacks by criminals in military uniform. The Alumni said the assailants shot directly at the car and the bullet pierced his head causing instant death. “We condemn the high level of insecurity in the country which has left the entire citizens in fear”, the statement read. The body put assassination “on the door step of the inept Buhari-led federal government and Dapo Abiodun-led state government that have both spent billions of Naira on security”. The association urged security agencies to fish out “the suspected Fulani militia” and other criminal gangs operating in Ogun and bring them to book. Odukomaiya is survived by his young wife, two children, and family members.
