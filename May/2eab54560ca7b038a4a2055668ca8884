The All Progressives Congress (APC) has insisted President Muhammadu Buhari has the capacity to end the insecurity in Nigeria. The party made the comment in reaction to the communique by governors of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on incidents across the country. John Akpan Udoedehe, the National Secretary, in a statement said the APC shares the concerns of all well-meaning Nigerians. The scribe warned against politicising the situation, adding that citizens’ duty to Nigeria should outweigh party affiliation. Udoedehe said PDP governors receive security briefings and should know that divisive rhetorics can only embolden the criminals carrying out cowardly acts. “This is not the time to play to the gallery, but sit down to find real and lasting solutions. The latter is what the President Buhari administration is doing”, he noted. The APC confirmed that “high-level investigations are ongoing to fish out sponsors and perpetrators of the security incidents”. The party said Buhari already gave marching orders to security services to check the spate of attacks nationwide. “We pray the investigations should not reveal conspiracies by the opposition to weaken the government in furtherance of their desperate 2023 aspirations”, the statement read. Udoedehe expressed confidence that PDP governors and all stakeholders will support ongoing efforts to permanently end insecurity in Nigeria.
