The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has released new prophecies concerning the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. The cleric spoke during a live service in his church on Sunday afternoon. Primate Ayodele also spoke about what God showed him regarding the interim President of Chad, Mahamat ibn Idriss Déby Itno, also called Mahamat Kaka, and how he will be instrumental in the fight against terrorism in Africa. He also revealed the warning God asked him to deliver to Deby if he wants to finish well. ‘’All African governments should support the interim government of Chad so that there can be a smooth transition to a democratic government. “The interim President, Kaka Deby, will perform beyond necessary but he must be security conscious, especially in September, October, November because the rebels are planning a dirty attack. He must be extremely careful during this period,” he said. ‘’He should also create an enabling environment so all the rebels in his country can be eliminated. The chad president will help Nigeria fight terrorism in her borders.” On the war going on between Israel and Palestine, Ayodele advised world leaders not to overlook it because he foresees the war causing a serious religious crisis. He revealed that other countries may join the war, leading to its escalation if care is not taken. ‘’World leaders must not overlook what is going on in Israel, other countries may also join, other Israeli enemies will also join. “They shouldn’t let this war cause a religious crisis in the world, this is what I have been talking about. “Religious crises may come from the Asia part of the world, this war may still escalate if care isn’t taken,” he said.
