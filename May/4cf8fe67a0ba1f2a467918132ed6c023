Mino Raiola, the agent to Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has said the player may move to Real Madrid and suggested that a swap deal involving Eden Hazard be discussed with Manchester United. Pogba is being linked with an exit from Old Trafford this summer and has previously caught the attention of Madrid, who are managed by his compatriot Zinedine Zidane. Speaking to AS, Raiola was asked why Pogba is yet to sign for the Spanish giants. He replied: “It’s a question for Madrid. “At one time, Pogba felt a lot of love for, and trust in, United, and there are various other clubs. “Afterwards, it’s really hard for United and Madrid to reach an understanding on a massive transfer because big clubs don’t like selling great players to other big clubs. “And I’m not going to kid you, for Pogba, playing at Madrid was always a really attractive option, because of Zidane too. He’s Pogba’s childhood hero.”
