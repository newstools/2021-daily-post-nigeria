Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham, is at the point of no return under Thomas Tuchel, according to Sports Mail. The player who has been at Stamford Bridge since he was seven, is expected to leave at the end of this season, after falling out of favour. West Ham and Leicester City are among those interested and the Blues value Abraham at £40million. Once the club’s first-choice centre forward under Frank Lampard, now Abraham does not even make the bench these days. However, the England man remains Chelsea’s joint top goalscorer, despite playing a meagre 230 minutes under Thomas Tuchel. The 23-year-old is level with out-of-form Timo Werner, who has played in 50 games this season. Abraham has played 32 games, 16 of those as substitute.
