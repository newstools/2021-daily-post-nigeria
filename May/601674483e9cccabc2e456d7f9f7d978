The Leader of the INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has warned that the call for restructuring will lead to the disintegration of Nigeria. Primate Ayodele said the disintegration of Nigeria will happen because the co-existence of the country is already under threat. He also warned that restructuring would cause problems between Northern and Southern governors. A statement to DAILY POST by the cleric said Northern governors would reject the idea of restructuring, thereby, causing problems with their Southern counterparts. The prophet also advised President Muhammadu Buhari to adjust, manage the loopholes and pray to God especially about the insecurity that has bitten the country hard. He said: ‘’Restructuring will eventually lead to the disintegration of Nigeria and the issue of restructuring will cause problems between the Northerners and Southerners, it will create loggerheads among the governors because the issue of restructuring will be rejected by northerners, and will aggravate issues. ‘’The government needs to adjust, do what is right and manage the loopholes, there is a crack in our co-existence, we need prayers to work on this, insecurity will bring economic hardship because the government doesn’t know what to do about the issue of insecurity.’’ Biafra, Oduduwa: Real enemies of Nigeria won’t support disintegration – Pastor Giwa
