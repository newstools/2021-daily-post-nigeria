The Coalition of Civil Societies Organisations has charged the Federal Government to secure the lives of Nigerians as security challenges such as kidnapping, banditry and insurgency have been on the rise recently. The coalition made this known during a protest, tagged: ‘National Day of Action Against Insecurity in Nigeria’, in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, on Monday. They challenged the president to provide a solution to the challenges or resign if it has become overwhelming. Waheed Saka, the convener of Dialogue 365, explained that the reason for the protest was because the state of insecurity has increased.  According to him, a peaceful and prosperous nation is the duty of every government which the current administration cannot deliver. While acknowledging that criminality is being tackled by the various state governors in the south west, he accused President Muhammadu Buhari of failure. “The people are angry with the government and there is a need for the people to join the movement since the fight is a collective one”, he added. Ayo Ologun disclosed that many Nigerians do not have a belief in the constitution review of the National Assembly.  In questioning the rationale behind the killing of a former Special Adviser to President Goodluck Jonathan, Ahmed Gulak, he asserted that nobody is safe again in the country. “If the president cannot do it, he should resign if he can’ not secure the lives of the people. “The people are asking the leadership to provide for the people, banish hunger and secure lives. “There is a need for restructuring to make the states viable.”  The protest, which is still ongoing, moved from Freedom Park through Oke-Fia, Old Garage and Station Road areas of the state capital.
