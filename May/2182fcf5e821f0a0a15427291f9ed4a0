Villarreal has been handed a major injury boost ahead of their Europa League final clash with Manchester United on May 26 in Poland. Villarreal winger, Samuel Chukwueze, returned to the club’s first-team training on Thursday morning after he suffered a muscle injury in the second leg of their Europa League semi-final tie against Arsenal earlier this month. Chukwueze’s injury was expected to keep him out for a month, which would have ruled him out of the Europa League final against Man United next week. However, the Nigerian international was pictured in training Thursday morning with the rest of the Villarreal team. Chukwueze also shared some pictures of himself in training on his Instagram stories. He wrote, “It was a morning training session today for the Yellows! Chukwueze’s return to training comes after Villarreal manager, Unai Emery, disclosed that the player is a doubt for their LaLiga clash against Real Madrid on Saturday. Emery, however, confirmed the 21-year-old could feature against Man United. Chukwueze has scored one goal and registered five assists for Villarreal in the Europa League this season.
