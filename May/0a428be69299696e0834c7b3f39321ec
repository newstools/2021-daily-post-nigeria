The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF, has rubbished calls that President Muhammadu Buhari should pick his next Chief of Army Staff, COAS, from the Southeast. Speaking with DAILY POST, AYCF, National President, Yerima Shettima downplayed the possibility of the next COAS coming from the Southeast due to what he termed “nonsense” coming from the region. Shettima said Buhari reserves the right to appoint a COAS loyal and determined to work with him. Following the death of the nation’s COAS, Ibrahim Attahiru in an air mishap on Friday, some Nigerians on social media had suggested that the next Army Chief should come from the Southeast. But Shettima said: “Appointing a Chief of Army Staff is at the discretion of the President, people should stop this blackmail. “It is solely the responsibility of the president to pick who is loyal and can give him what he wants. So, let’s do away with this sentiments and blackmail of people talking anyhow that the next Chief of Army Staff should go to the Southeast with this nonsense we are seeing in the region.” Shettima said the new Army Chief should have the zeal and determination to end insecurity in Nigeria. He said the new COAS should be determined to bring lasting peace to the country. Shettima added: “We hope whoever replaces Attahiru should have that zeal, seriousness and determination to bring a lasting peace to this country. “His replacement should be able to replace this criminality going on because some of us are of the view that there is no way anybody would have imagine that Nigerian Armed Forces known all over the world be overwhelmed by these criminals. “There is a conspiracy theory around this but time will unveil it because this is a country ruled by constitution and the rule of law must be respected. “We are not in a Banana Republic that things happen and people can get away with any question.” Buhari tolerating rubbish from Nigerians, hasn’t failed – Gov Masari
