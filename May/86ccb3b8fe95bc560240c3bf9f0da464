Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham, has thanked Aston Villa fans for chanting his name during their final Premier League game of the season against the Blues on Sunday. Abraham was left out of Chelsea’s match day squad against Aston Villa on Sunday as the hosts defeated the Blues 2-1 at Villa Park. The 23-year-old is set to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, having struggled to secure playing time since Thomas Tuchel replaced Frank Lampard as Chelsea manager last January. And Aston Villa fans made it clear that they would welcome back Abraham with open arms as they chanted his name during the second half of their win against Chelsea. Reacting after the match, Abraham posted a video on Twitter of the Villa fans singing along with the message: “Aston Villa fans, I appreciate you guys! Thank you & all the best in the future.” Abraham also gave a nod to Chelsea’s fourth-place finish in the Premier League: He tweeted, “Champions league secured. A long, hard Premier League season is complete. Onto the Champions League.” Abraham spent the 2018-2019 season on loan with Aston Villa in the Championship. He scored 26 goals in 40 games and helped them secure promotion to the Premier League. Meanwhile, Chelsea secured a fourth-placed finish as Leicester City were beaten 4-2 at the King Power Stadium by Tottenham Hotspur. EPL: Tammy Abraham at ‘point of no return’ under Tuchel
