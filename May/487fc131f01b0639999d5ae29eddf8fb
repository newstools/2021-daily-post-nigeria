Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom says any Nigerian opposed to the position of Southern Governors regarding the ban on open grazing of cattle has a hidden agenda. Governor Ortom spoke on Thursday at the Holy Ghost Parish Hall, Makurdi during an address on the occasion of ‘Media Week and Communications Day 2021’, organised by the Catholic Diocese of Makurdi. He noted that his colleagues from the Southern part of the country had towed the right path towards addressing insecurity in Nigeria, stressing that open grazing was no longer feasible in the country due to development and population growth. Governor Ortom said Nigeria is a great country with great potentials and should, ordinarily, have no business with poverty if only there was guaranteed security for lives and property and the people are allowed to remain stable in their localities to explore opportunities in farming and other ventures. The Governor expressed appreciation to the Church and Muslims, as well as residents and citizens of the state for remaining supportive of his administration. He also acknowledged the good reportage of government policies and programmes by the Directorate of Social Communication, Catholic Diocese of Makurdi and all the media groups in Benue, pointing out that his administration would always welcome constructive criticism. The Governor who hinted at his administration’s plans to commence teaching of vernacular in schools in the next academic session said children must be trained and supported to inculcate reading in them, even as he described communication as key in the society. Catholic Bishop of Makurdi Diocese, Most Reverend Wilfred Anagbe stated that social communication was meant to uplift humanity and society, stressing that it is a positive aspect of the reality of life and not the other way round. Bishop Anagbe who advocated for the teaching of history and vernacular in primary and secondary schools in the state said language defines a man and so should not be allowed to go extinct.
