Cristiano Ronaldo will take a pay cut to return to Manchester United from Juventus, according to AS. It is understood the Portugal captain is considering a return to Old Trafford more seriously than at any other point. Ronaldo left United 11 years ago to sign for Real Madrid, but has been regularly linked with a return to the Premier League club. United are monitoring the 36-year-old’s situation at Juventus, where failure to qualify for next season’s Champions League could lead to an exit, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer still in touch with his former United teammate. Solskjaer has spoken with Ronaldo, “outlining his plans for the team” and explaining “how important his return would be” for the club. Juve are unlikely to stand in the player’s way and will accept fee around €25m or look into a possible swap deal. EPL: Man Utd give Cristiano Ronaldo condition to return this summer
