Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has credited his predecessor, Frank Lampard, with the success of the team this season. Tuchel replaced Lampard in January after the former England midfielder was sacked by Roman Abramovich. The German has led the Blues to two finals in the FA Cup and Champions League within a short time. When asked how much credit is due to his predecessor for Chelsea’s achievements this season, Tuchel said: “For sure, you can only arrive in a final of the FA Cup or Champions League if you make it through the group stage. And Frank had an amazing record in the group stage of the Champions League and won all the FA Cup games that were there to win too. “So, this laid the foundation to arrive in the finals, and I will never forget it. We don’t feel ashamed or have any fear to say this out loud. And it felt like this the first day I came in here. “I’m well aware Frank created his own legacy here at Chelsea as a player and then tried to make it even bigger as a coach. And still, it had nothing to do with me, but we are well aware we’ve stepped in for the second half of the season and have tried to fulfil the job he has begun. “He has one of the biggest legacies, is one of the biggest players and key figures of this club. And he represents everything, when you think about Chelsea, you think about Frank Lampard. The way he is and how he played football, that showed his character.” Tuchel vs Lampard: Michael Essien names right manager for Chelsea
