Atletico Madrid striker, Luis Suarez, has provided the latest update on his future after winning the LaLiga title with the Rojiblancos over the weekend. Suarez vowed to remain at Atletico Madrid for at least another season, with transfer speculation surrounding the Uruguayan star brought to a close. There had been talk of Suarez having a clause in his contract that would allow him to walk away as a free agent in the summer, with a return to Liverpool being mooted. Speaking on his future at Atletico, Suarez told Movistar: “Yes, I am sure (I will stay). “Atletico welcomed me from the minute I arrived. I asked the club if there was room for me on the museum wall to make history at Atletico.” He added, “I’ve no doubts that people can get tired, but I am very hard-headed. I knew and know that this club can keep growing and I hope it will continue like this. “The club keeps growing. All of the unseen people have given the club stability beyond results. They have always wanted this. They are not here celebrating, but soon we’ll all embrace.” Suarez fired Atletico to La Liga title glory on Saturday, scoring a goal in their 2-1 victory against Valladolid. The 34-year-old joined Diego Simeone’s side from Barcelona last year. Luis Suarez picks better player, between Haaland, Mbappe
