Pastor Enoch Adeboye, General Overseer, Redeem Christian Church of God (RCCG), has lauded the governance and leadership style of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, describing him as a man of faith. Speaking when he visited the governor on Saturday in Lokoja, Adeboye also applauded Bello for his religious tolerance. Adeboye disclosed that the show of faith by Bello in handling the COVID-19 pandemic was a rare demonstration from a political leader. Adeboye said, “We’ve heard and seen your show of faith in God, particularly in dealing with the coronavirus. It takes the man of faith to have acted the way you did, and we’re very, very pleased with you. “We have also heard the news of how you’ve been relating to people of every faith to the extent that you built the first chapel in the Government House, Lokoja, we’re delighted, sir. “I want to assure you that we’ll keep on praying for you, we’ll keep on praying for the people of your state and I believe that the Almighty God will answer our prayers for you.” Adeboye also assured Bello that he would continue to offer prayers for the leadership and people of the state at large. In his response, Bello told Adeboye that the visit of a clergy was a gift and he was delighted to be hosting a father figure who served as a role model to many across the country, himself inclusive. The governor asserted that it was evil for any leader to continually do wrong without recourse to natural justice. He urged Adeboye to continue to pray for the country, the state, both leadership and followership. Bello stressed that all faiths at this very period should harmonise the nation, and called for divine intervention for the nation instead of beating the drums of division and war.
