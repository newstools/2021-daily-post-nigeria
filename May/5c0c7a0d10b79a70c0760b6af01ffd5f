Nigerian forces have arrested a dismissed soldier, who trained fighters recruited for the Eastern Security Network (ESN) by the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Former Army Lance Corporal, Livinus Owalum-Barnabas, was nabbed in the Gwagwalada area of Abuja, Eons Intelligence reports. Owalum-Barnabas was said to have trained more than 2,000 IPOB ESN fighters. During interrogation, the suspect confessed he was paid N200,000 for the job. Government forces have stepped up the hunt for top IPOB members and collaborators. Two weeks ago, Awurum Eze, the deputy to Ikonso Don, late commander of the ESN, was apprehended. Eze, 48 years old, is a native of Umoneke Nta, Isiala-Mbano Local Government Area of Imo State. Ikonso and six others were killed in April. Other fighters nabbed in that joint operation are in detention. I sacrificed my parents for Biafra, I will sacrifice everything â€“ Nnamdi Kanu vows
