Fifteen persons have reportedly lost their lives and many still missing in a boat mishap in Tijana, Munya Local Government Area of Niger State. DAILY POST gathered the boat mishap happened at about 6:00 pm on Saturday when the villagers were returning from a local market in Zumba, Shiroro Local Government area of the State. Confirming the incident, the Snarkin Kasuwan (Head of the Market) of Zumba, Mallam Adamu Ahmed stated that the local boat was conveying over 60 people, including women and children when it capsized. He told DAILY POST that the mishap was as a result of a heavy windstorm that occurred in the area yesterday. He explained that about 17 villagers have so far been rescued alive through the efforts of local divers who saved their lives immediately the incident was reported, while many are still missing. According to him, the local divers defied the heavy downpour to search and rescue victims, adding that help was yet to come from the government. Among the victims were some returnees who had earlier fled their ancestral homes with their children following bandits attacks in the area. It would be recalled that a similar boat accident occurred in 2017, which claimed over 13 lives when a boat carrying about 30 people, capsized midway into their journey to the same Zumba market.
