The Chairman of Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN), Cross River State branch, Comrade Asanya Ebong, has accused the Attorney-General, Accountant-General and Auditor-General of the Federation for being responsible for prolonging the strike action embarked upon by the judiciary workers in the country. Speaking with DAILY POST on Friday, Comrade Ebong, regretted the actions of the top government functionaries, noting their failure to implement the executive order 10 signed by President Buhari and respect the 1999 constitution as amended Ebong accused the government functionaries for the role they played in not enforcing President Buhari’s directive, stating that such action was disrespectful to the office of the President and the officials should be sanctioned or forced to resign honourably. His words, “The strike we have embarked upon is to inform Nigerians that they are practicing selective justice and selective respect to the law. “We all know that any other arrangement or law that is not consistent with that constitution to the extent of such inconsistency is null and void. “We are agitating for the respect of that ground norms, the respect of the constitution which is why we are on strike, just like every other right thinking Nigerian would want to do, they are voiceless people, people we think by this strike are suffering, we are fighting for the liberation for tomorrow.” “We are all suffering but what I stand to say is that all these show that there is still darkness and at the end of the tunnel, there is light. Like we have heard, if the political class really mean well and are patriotic to Nigerians, which they are not, any person that is patriotic to Nigerians, such a person must respect the law no matter what anybody says.”
