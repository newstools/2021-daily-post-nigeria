The President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Mr. Amaju Pinnick has decried the poor standard of the pitch of Osogbo Township Stadium and tasked the state government and Football Association to upgrade it to accepted standard. Pinnick made this known Thursday when paid a working visit to the state. Pinnick had expressed satisfaction at the Lanreleke Sports Academy in Ileogbo and described the academy as a novel initiative in the Sub-Saharan Africa. But when arrived at the Osogbo Township Stadium, Pinnick expressed displeasure at the condition of the stadium’s pitch and said it is not in line with club licensing. He called on the state government and the Football Association to re-grass it and make the tattered pitch more appealing. In his words, “Apart from this (stadium) which we need to talk to the FA and the State Government to re-grass, because this is not in line with club licensing and the problem is that we are here, we will deal with all these issues,” the football administrator said. He described Osun as a peaceful state and that development would take place in it. “We are excited about it (the new Sports Academy). Anything football development is welcomed by the Nigeria Football Federation and what we have seen here is very new, it’s not just football, it’s sports generally. It’s something that is very novel in the sub-Saharan Africa and that’s why I have to come. Osun State is very peaceful and under a peaceful atmosphere, you have robust development.” “Fans will be allowed into stadium pretty soon after our next assessment, it will be very soon. In the World Cup finals which will be coming up in another about five or six weeks, we have to look into it and we also have to liase with NCDC,” he said.
