Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has kicked against the Southern Governors’ call for the restructuring of Nigeria. DAILY POST recalls that the governors under the aegis of Southern Nigerian Governors’ Forum on May 11, resolved for the restructuring of the country to end agitation for secession in the region. The governors made the decision in Asaba, the Delta State capital, while deliberating on how to curb deteriorating security situation in their respective states and other parts of the country. However, the IPOB leader, in a tweet on Friday via his Tweeter handle, said Nigeria needs secession not restructuring. According to him, restructuring may not end the bad governance that stimulated the agitation for separation. “Do you want Nigeria restructured to the 1960 era that lasted only 6 years? Or to Aburi that drove you all mad enough to commit GENOCIDE? “Will this your new #restructuring turn bad men to good men? It won’t. “What Nigeria needs is dismemberment, not some dodgy restructuring”, Kanu Tweeted. Restructuring means allowing youths take over leadership of Nigeria – Yahaya Bello
