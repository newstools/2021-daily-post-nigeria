Nigeria and Mexico will play a friendly tie in Los Angeles, United States, on July 3. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) confirmed that the match will be held at the Memorial Coliseum, California. Ademola Olajire, the Director of Communication, in a statement, said the kick-off time is 7:30pm. It would be the sixth meet between the senior teams; four ended in draws. “The only win in the series has gone to Mexico, when they won a US Gold Cup encounter in Dallas 2-1 on June 24, 1995,” Olajire said. NFF FIFA Match Agent, Jairo Pachon of Eurodata Sport, expressed excitement over the match. The teams are expected to announce their squads in June.
