Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has triggered a new contract by winning the Champions League, the UK Mirror reports. Tuchel only signed an 18-month deal when he arrived at Stamford Bridge in January and his family have yet to move from Germany to join him. However, Tuchel’s £7m-a-year contract included bonuses and incentives with an extension kicking in automatically, if the Blues won the Champions League or Premier League in his first season. The former Paris Saint-Germain boss has also revealed that he is moving his wife and two children to London this summer. He said: “We will get a house in the middle of July, so when I come this is almost ready when we restart and then we go to Dublin I think for a training camp and after that I will move into a house. And my family will come over in August and, of course, this is a huge part. “Yeah it felt like also sacrifice, it was in some ways also good to have the full concentration and the full focus during this crazy time with corona and Brexit, and kids in school, that we don’t have to balance everything. But it was a lot for also them and now to have them on the pitch felt like a big reward.” EPL: Top six highest-paying clubs in England revealed
