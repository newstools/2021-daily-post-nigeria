Four Chelsea players are set to leave Stamford Bridge this summer transfer window. According to football transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, Chelsea is already making headway in offloading its players, Victor Moses, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Emerson Palmieri and Fikayo Tomori, at the end of the season. Romano disclosed this in a tweet on his Twitter handle on Thursday ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League final day fixture against Aston Villa on Sunday. He said Moses, who is currently on loan at Spartak Moscow, is likely to join the Turkish club on a permanent deal with an ‘agreement’ already reached between the two clubs. Bakayoko and Tomori are currently on loan at Napoli and AC Milan, respectively, while Emerson is out of favour under Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel. “Chelsea is already working to sell players,” Romano tweeted. “Victor Moses will join Spartak Moscow on a permanent deal, agreement reached. “Tiemoué Bakayoko and Emerson Palmieri will also leave the club this summer. AC Milan will decide next week about Fikayo Tomori [€28m buy option].”
