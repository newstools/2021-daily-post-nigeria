A legal practitioner, Kayode Ajulo has urged the federal government to engage retired military and paramilitary personnel as part of measures to tackle insecurity. In a statement on Saturday, Ajulo said the idea was better than using mercenaries. The lawyer urged the government to convene a national security summit to enable veterans and experts suggest ways out of the challenge. He warned that Nigeria’s social and economic indicators could deteriorate further unless radical reforms were taken. Ajulo advised the government to be proactive in employing modern methods of intelligence gathering and sharing, additional training, improved logistics and motivation. He added that Nigeria was at a critical juncture where the people must collaborate and support one another against the devastation going on. “Solidarity is indeed non-negotiable at this time and the expectations of everyone is that the insecurity would be arrested in no time,’’ Ajulo said.
