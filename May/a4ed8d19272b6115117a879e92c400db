The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) Joint Task Force (JTF) has demolished a Fulani Ruga settlement located very close to Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. Chairman, FCT Ministerial Committee on City Sanitation, Mr Ikharo Attah, disclosed this on Sunday in Abuja. Attah said the Fulani settlement was destroyed due to the contravention of sanitation regulations. According to him, the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, had expressed displeasure over the continuing contravention on in and out-bounds of the roads. He stressed that the Airport road is a major gateway to the city centre of Nigeria’s capital, and therefore, all occupants would have to comply with rules and regulations. Attah disclosed that the minister, who visited the affected areas two months ago with key stakeholders, had held consultations with both residents and community leaders to sensitise them on the need to remove all the contravention. He said, “The minister gave matching orders that the contraventions be removed. Since then, we have been collaborating with district heads of the affected areas, giving them notices and warning. “We have actually given them two months and there is no compliance and that is why we have come to remove the contraventions.” Attah added that with the help of a joint security task force, the tempo of the exercise would be maintained to ensure full compliance.
