Tottenham Hotspur striker, Harry Kane, has claimed Jose Mourinho failed during his time at the club, because some of his team mates struggled with his demands. Mourinho was fired by Spurs with the club sitting in seventh in the Premier League. The North London side were also dumped out of the Europa League in embarrassing fashion in March. Although his team’s performances were often avergae, Mourinho managed to get the best out of Kane. The 27-year-old has now admitted that Mourinho did not have a great relationship with other squad members. “Obviously Mauricio we do a lot of gym work, it was a lot gym base whereas Jose wasn’t so much into that but Jose obviously expected us to be men and act like men on the pitch, have leaders on the pitch. “To be honest, that’s probably where it didn’t quite work out with Jose we didn’t quite have enough leadership that we needed at the time,” Kane told Gary Neville on The Overlap when asked about the Pochettino and Mourinho’s approaches to management.
