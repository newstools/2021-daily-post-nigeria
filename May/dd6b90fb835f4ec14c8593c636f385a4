Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State on Saturday declared his belief in a united Nigeria and condemned calls for secession by some groups in the country. The governor disclosed this in Abakaliki during the conclusion of the 8-day prayer and fasting session organised by the State’s Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) over the security situation in Ebonyi. Umahi said he believed in Nigeria, where oneness, freedom, equity, justice, fairness, among other virtues, prevailed. “I don’t believe in second-class citizenship where a section of the country is being seen to be superior to others,” he said. “We’re all created by God, and no one should talk of disintegrating the country.” Umahi admitted that most of the secessionist groups’ agitations were genuine, noting that they could, however, be addressed. He said, “I want Igbos to submit these agitations, and I would lead the governors and leaders of the zone to the centre to address these grievances. “The groups can then do what they like if, after six months, we fail to address these grievances.” The governor urged the people to shun bitterness, anger, violence, among other vices, to avoid bringing war and destruction unto the land. “We would tell the authorities in Abuja that our people are aggrieved, but such cannot be addressed by insulting the president, governors and leaders from other regions of the country,” he said.
