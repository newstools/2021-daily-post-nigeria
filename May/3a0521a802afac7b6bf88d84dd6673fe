The DPO said. Reacting to the incident, the Cross River State Police Commissioner, Sikiru Akande dispelled the rumours and warned that anyone who tampers with any of his men would pay dearly. “Never again a thing like that can ever happen when disgruntled individuals would launch attacks on policemen who are doing their legitimate job to protect lives and property. “We can’t take such rubbish anymore again.
