Deji Adeyanju, an Abuja-based right activist has mocked Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State over his remark of running for the presidency. Adeyanju, who is the co-convener of Concerned Nigerian Advocacy Group said Bello lacks the capacity to be president of a “pig farm,” let alone, ruling Nigeria. Bello had hinted on running for the 2023 presidency when he pledged not to disappoint Nigerians. The governor had said some Nigerians were asking him to run for President in 2023. He had said: “Nigerians, the youth and women including very objective elites, are asking me to run for President in 2023.” Reacting, Adeyanju said Bello cannot be Nigeria’s president because the governor has neglected the Kogi State civil servants. The rights activist insisted that Kogi State remains the worst governed state in Nigeria. In a tweet, Adeyanju wrote: “NEWS: All Nigerians are asking me to run for President in 2023, I will not disappoint – Yahaya Bello “ME -Yahaya Bello is not fit to be president of a pig farm. Kogi State is the worst governed state in Nigeria. Civil servants are feeding from dustbins.” Reactions as Deji Adeyanju questions existence of Ogun governor
