Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel has hit out at Video Assistant Referee (VAR), after several decisions went against them during their 2-1 win over Leicester City on Tuesday night. Timo Werner saw two goals ruled out and was denied a penalty when he appeared to be kicked by Youri Tielemans inside the box. Although goals from Antonio Rudiger and Jorginho sealed the victory in front of fans at Stamford Bridge, Tuchel was left frustrated by the decisions. He said: “It’s a clear penalty. They [VAR] are horrible against us and it’s the third time in a row. “We have a goal against Arsenal denied with handball, we have a goal against Leicester in the cup with a hand and today, it is a penalty but the foul goes against us. “This has to stop of course but we were not worried at half-time. We just said ‘let’s do it again and force it’.” Premier League referees to make changes to VAR
