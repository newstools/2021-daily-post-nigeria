Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said he is working hard to justify the vast resources Roman Abramovich has invested into the team, by winning the Champions League again. The Blues will face Premier League rivals Manchester City in the final on May 29. Tuchel’s men beat Real Madrid 3-1 on aggregate in the semi-final to book their place. That game will come after an FA Cup final against Leicester City. “I am in touch with the board, I am in touch with all the people who are in charge. “I have no regrets and I am pretty sure he [Abramovich] likes what he sees and he likes the results. This is what he deserves. “He has built a fantastic club and I am part of this club. We try to make him happy and ourselves happy. So we have the same goals,” Tuchel said.
