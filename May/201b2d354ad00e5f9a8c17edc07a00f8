Manchester United striker, Edinson Cavani, has said he wants to “leave something positive behind” at the club. The 34-year-old moved to Old Trafford on a short-term deal in the summer of 2020 as a free agent. That agreement is coming to a close, there has been speculation linking with a switch to Boca Juniors. Cavani, in an interview with Inside United, spoke about the role he fills and what he hopes to achieve in Manchester. He said: “Honestly speaking, I don’t really like to just give out advice. “But if a young player comes up and asks me something or they see me do things during a training session that they would like to incorporate into their game, then that’s great. “If they want to take something I say or do and take it as an example to use in their future development, then I would be very happy, because it’s important to leave something positive behind.” Cavani has scored 12 goals for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side since he arrived and the club is trying to extend his stay for one more year at least.
