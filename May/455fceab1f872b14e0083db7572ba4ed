The leadership of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) has commended the Southern Governors for the bold steps being taken to protect the citizens of the region. Recall that the Southern Governors Forum on Tuesday urged the Federal Government to urgently convoke a national dialogue to address the widespread agitations in the nation. The 15 members in attendance also called for restructuring of the country leading to the evolution of state police. Reacting, in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday, MASSOB lauded the governors for the critical decisions taken to protect the political interest and future survival of southern Nigeria from the subjective domination of Hausa Fulani controlled northern regions. The group said the people will always stand solidly behind the southern governors and support their latest moves of salvaging the people from the alleged marauding Fulani terrorist herdsmen imported from some West African countries to carry out president Muhamadu Buhari’s Islamization agenda. “The unanimous decision of the southern region governors in banning the open grazing by Fulani herdsmen and insistence on national dialogue have suddenly aroused and stirred up the frustrated anger and insensitivity of the northern leaders and their clueless president Muhamadu Buhari through Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) which opposed the position of the southern region governors Forum in banning open grazing. “The Hausa Fulani people are fearful cowards, they only depend on the indigenous people of the Middle Belt region to carry out their political, subjective domination, religious and economical wars against the southern region. “MASSOB advises that the indigenous people of the Middle Belt region unanimously oppose every external pressure of the Fulani oligarchy to subject them as political tools of waging war against the southern region. “The indigenous people of the Middle Belt region must join the southern region in their quest for political emancipation from the subjective domination of Fulani oligarchy,” the statement said.
