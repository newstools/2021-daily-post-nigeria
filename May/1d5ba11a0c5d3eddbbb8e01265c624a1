The Football Association, FA, has charged Chelsea and Leicester for failing to control their players during Tuesday’s Premier League game at Stamford Bridge. The charge relates to a brawl that erupted during stoppage time of Chelsea’s 2-1 victory against Leicester, after a challenge by Ricardo Pereira on Ben Chilwell. The fight all began when Antonio Rudiger reacted to Leicester’s Pereira’s late challenge on Chelsea’s Chilwell. Players and staff from Chelsea and Leicester squared up to each other after the challenge and the clubs now face possible sanctions. “Chelsea FC and Leicester City FC have both been charged with a breach of FA Rule E20.1 following their Premier League fixture on Tuesday, May 18, 2021. “It is alleged that both clubs failed to ensure their players and/or club officials conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and/or refrained from provocative behaviour during the 93rd minute. “Chelsea FC and Leicester City FC both have until Tuesday, May 25, 2021 to provide their respective responses,” an FA statement read.
