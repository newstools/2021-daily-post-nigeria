Commercial motorcyclists on Friday went berserk in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital as they attacked motorists along Kotopo area of Obantoko. DAILY POST learnt that the okada riders protested over the manner in which one of them was knocked down by a vehicle. The victim was said to have died at the spot of the incident, a development that angered his colleagues, who started vandalising vehicles on sight. Many vehicles had their windscreens shattered by the irate bike riders. Reacting, the Ogun state police command condemned the actions of the motorcyclists. The command’s image maker, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said okada riders are in the habit of violently attacking any motorist who involved in an accident with their member, and in most cases preventing accident victim from being taken to hospital for medical attention and at times, causing the death of such victim. Oyeyemi, while confirming that the motorcyclist was knocked down by a vehicle, expressed disappointment that “instead of his colleagues to allow him to be taken to hospital for treatment, they became so violent and in the process, the victim died without being allowed to be attended to.” The command, therefore, warned that such unruly behaviour will no longer be tolerated, adding that anybody or group that is involved in such an act will henceforth be arrested and prosecuted.
