A tanker carrying a petroleum product caught fire on the Otedola bridge in Lagos on Friday. The Fire Service, the Police, LASTMA, LASEMA and FRSC are at the scene to control the situation and manage traffic. The Otedola bridge has become infamous for accidents involving heavy duty vehicles and others, with attendant deaths and damages. Just this week, the Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps in Lagos, Olusegun Ogungbemide insisted there are no demons in the area. Ogungbemide blamed reckless drivers and expired trucks for recurrent crashes. In December 2020, at least 11 people sustained injuries when a tanker, loaded with diesel, exploded on the bridge. The tanker rolled back and collided with another truck carrying goods as well as a salon car. There’s a tanker head on fire currently on Otedola Bridge. Men of the Lagos State Fire Department are on ground to put it out before it gets to the main tank. Use alternative routes in the meantime. pic.twitter.com/PotGpFYzlu — ette kamba (@Tyek000n) May 28, 2021
