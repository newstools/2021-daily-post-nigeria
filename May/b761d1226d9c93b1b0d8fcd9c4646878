Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, would prefer the club to make a transfer move for Inter Milan’s Romelu Lukaku instead of Dortmund’s Erling Haaland. Lukaku and Haaland have been heavily linked with a move to Chelsea this summer transfer. The Sport Bild reported that Lukaku is on Tuchel’s shortlist of strikers he wants the Chelsea board to sign this summer as Tammy Abraham is out of favour and Timo Werner missing a string of glorious chances for the Blues this season. Tuchel actually wants Lukaku, having ‘fallen in love with the Belgium international. The German believes Lukaku is the ‘polished’ striker that could slide into his team next season. Lukaku, a former Chelsea striker, has also played for Everton and Manchester United in the past. Meanwhile, Lukaku recently revealed his feelings for Chelsea in a Twitter Q&A. He said, “Nothing but love. They [Chelsea] gave me an opportunity to come to the Premier League as a kid.” “You can’t have everything in life and I am cool with that. I’m glad that experience got me to where I am today.”
