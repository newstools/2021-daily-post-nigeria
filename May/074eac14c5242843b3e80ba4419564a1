The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has debunked the allegations that the group is plotting an attack in Lagos State. Earlier today, DAILY POST reported that the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, claimed that the state Police Command is investigating IPOB, Oodua Republic and other groups over a plot to attack soft targets in the state. According to Odumosu, 24 of such groups have been identified and they are being closely monitored. He assured that the security services in the state have all of them on their radar. In reaction, Kanu took to his Twitter page, to state the “lie” was a plot to fuel division. “The public is hereby notified that the allegations that IPOB is plotting to attack Lagos is a LIE,” Kanu wrote. He added: “Lagos State CP, Hakeem Odumosu who made the allegation is a former CSO to Tinubu & their intention is to fuel division between Yorubas & Biafrans. It won’t work. This is not 1967!”
