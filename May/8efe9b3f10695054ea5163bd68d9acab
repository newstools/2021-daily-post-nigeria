President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to the death of Alhaji Musa Tanko Bawa, father of Senator Sani Mohammed Musa. A statement signed by Garba Shehu, his spokesman, said Buhari sent his heartfelt condolence to the lawmaker and members of his family. Buhari, according to the statement, described as shocking the death of the thoroughbred civil servant who devoted his life of service and honesty to the development of the Northern Region, working in different parts and capacities during his career in government. “Iyan Minna was a committed civil servant, who exhibited the values of discipline, integrity and devotion wherever he found himself, he will surely be missed,” he said. Buhari recalled that his tour of duty took him to Kaduna, Maiduguri, Gombe, Sokoto and Minna, his immediate community where he distinguished himself and left his footprints. The President urged the children and other family members to take solace in the life of service and integrity which the late Tanko Bawa lived and uphold his memory by continuing the good works he left behind. He prayed that Allah would forgive his sins and reward him with Aljannah. EFCC targets corrupt assets in UAE, UK, reminds bankers of June 1 plan
