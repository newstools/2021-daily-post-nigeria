The Osun State Government has announced that it is shutting down indefinitely the Inisa Town Central Mosque in Odo-Otin Local Government Council Area. The decision to shut down the mosque follows the inability of the Muslim community of the town to peacefully install a new Imam for the mosque. This decision, which was made known in a public service announcement signed by Prince Abdullah Adeyanju Binuyo, the Deputy Chief of Staff to the Governor and made available to DAILY POST Tuesday in Osogbo also directed that any central congregation at the mosque for Eid prayers has also been banned. According to the announcement, “Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, as part of efforts to ensure security of lives and properties in that axis of the State, directed that the Central Mosque be shut indefinitely to forestall further religious or communal crisis. “Already the Mosque has recorded the death of two Imams in quick succession. “This directive will be in place until a reconciliatory process towards amicable resolution is concluded”, it concluded. The state government also advised members of the public to be guided by this directive as security operatives have been deployed to the town to enforce the closure and ban on Eid prayers.
