The Federal Government has commenced investigation into the air crash that killed the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru and other officers. Hadi Sirika, the Minister of Aviation, said the investigation would be carried out in conjunction with the military. A military plane carrying Attahiru and 10 other officers had crashed on Friday in Kaduna. The Army Chief and his entourage were on an official trip to Kaduna when the aircraft was crashed at the Kaduna International Airport. All deceased passengers were later flown back to Abuja and buried at the military cemetery. However, Serika commiserated with President Muhammadu Buhari and the nation at large. In a tweet, the Minister wrote: “With heavy heart we in Civil Aviation commiserate with the Nation & the C-in-C on the NAF air crash. “Investigation has commenced today in accordance with our recent MOU with the military. We pray Allah grant mercy to their souls & may the outcome prevent future occurrence.” Meanwhile, some Nigerians have called on constituted authorities to probe the cause of the mishap that killed Attahiru and the other officers onboard.
