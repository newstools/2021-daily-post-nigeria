Rangers have ended the 2020/2021 session unbeaten in the Scottish top flight. They hammered Aberdeen 4-0 on Saturday afternoon, to finish the season without a defeat. An own goal from Lewis, followed by two goals from Roofe before a Defoe strike gives them a 4-0 win over Aberdeen today. Out of 38 games, they recorded 32 wins and six draws. Steven Gerrard’s men also hit 102 points and set a new record for most clean sheets kept in the Scottish top flight with 26. Today’s win also means they finish the campaign with a 100 per cent record at Ibrox. The rangers were already confirmed champions last month.
