Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has ruled Harry Maguire out of his team’s last three Premier League fixtures. However, Solskjaer is hoping his captain will recover in time for the Europa League final against Villarreal. Maguire hobbled off during the 3-1 win over Aston Villa last weekend and was spotted wearing a protective boot and on crutches in the stands, as the Red Devils lost to Leicester City on Tuesday night. United have three league games left, with Liverpool at Old Trafford on Thursday followed by Fulham at home on Tuesday and the final game of the campaign away to Wolves. Solskjaer said: “The good news is it wasn’t broken, there was no fracture, but a ligament injury is serious. If I’m very positive, maybe stretching it but I’m hoping he might be ready for it (the Europa League final). “I don’t think he’ll play in the league again but we’ll do everything we can to get him ready for the final. “You always try to look after players long-term. If he’s fit he’ll play for us, if he’s not he won’t. We’re hopeful he’s ready and if he’s ready for us he’ll be ready for the Euros.” EPL: Man Utd suffer major injury ahead of Leicester City, Liverpool games
