Chelsea striker, Timo Werner, has claimed that this is his unluckiest season as a footballer. Werner arrived at Stamford Bridge last summer in a £47.5m deal from RB Leipzig. Although he started well for the Blues, he lost form and has scored only 12 times for the Blues. During the 2-1 win over Leicester City on Tuesday night, the German striker saw two goals chalked off and was denied a penalty. Werner however won the spot kick that Jorginho converted to make it 2-0 in the second half. “The first half was the picture of the whole season for me. “I think it’s the unluckiest season I have ever had and will have maybe. Offside, a clear penalty and then I want to make a header, I get a little push and I head it against my arm. “But when you are so unlucky but you still reach the Champions League final and maybe reach the Champions League next season, everything is good,” Werner told Sky Sports.
