Former Manchester City star, Micah Richards has predicted that Chelsea will drop out of the Premier League top four despite being third in the table. The former City defender tipped Liverpool and Leicester to clinch the final two Champions League places. His prediction follows Liverpool’s 3-0 win against Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday, which saw the Reds go above Leicester into fourth on goal difference. Liverpool’s win ensured that the race for next season’s Champions League places will go down to the wire. Thomas Tuchel’s Blues head into their last game against Aston Villa at Villa Park on Sunday in third place on 67 points, while Liverpool welcome Crystal Palace at Anfield trailing the west Londoners by a point. Brendan Rodgers’ Leicester, meanwhile, are also on 66 points but have a goal difference of 20, compared to Liverpool’s 24. Leicester play Tottenham in front of their supporters at the King Power Stadium on the final day knowing they must win and hope the teams above them drop points. And Richards thinks Chelsea will slip, backing Leicester and Liverpool to finish in the top four. “I’m going to say Chelsea draw at Villa and Leicester beat Spurs,” he told Sky Sports. “I think Liverpool will get the job done. “If there’s one turn that’s what I can see happening. Just because Chelsea have now got their eye on the Champions League final.” Roberto Firmino, Nat Phillips and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were the scorers for Jurgen Klopp’s side as they wrapped up over Burnley.
