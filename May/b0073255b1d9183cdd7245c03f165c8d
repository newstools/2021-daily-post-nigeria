Manchester United came back from behind to beat Aston Villa 3-1 on Sunday. Their victory in the Midlands means Manchester City must wait to be crowned Premier League champions. City needs three points to be confirmed title winners or for United to drop three points. However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâ€™s team made it 31 points from losing positions, the most of any Premier League side. Bertrand Traore gave the hosts the lead with a superb solo effort in the 24th minute. The Red Devils turned it around in the second half, with goals from Bruno Fernandes, Mason Greenwood and Edinson Cavani. If United lose to either Leicester (Tues) or Liverpool (Thurs) or drop points in both games, City will be crowned champions. Even if United goes on winning, City can still win the title by taking matters into their own hands by beating Newcastle on Friday night.
