Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, has said Nigeria will continue to suffer if there is no restructuring before 2023. The group stated this in a communique issued on Friday, at the end of a meeting held in Ogun State. “We in Afenifere believe very strongly that failure to practise federalism and increasing Unitarisation of the country were largely responsible for the travails Nigeria is suffering today and will continue to suffer, unless Nigeria is restructured,” it read in part. Afenifere also expressed support for Southern Governors’ ban on open grazing in the region. The group claimed the decision is long overdue, due to the “atrocities” that open grazing has brought with it. “Afenifere felt that although the declaration by the governors ought to have come long before now, given the atrocities that have arisen from open grazing, it is better late than never,” the communique added.
