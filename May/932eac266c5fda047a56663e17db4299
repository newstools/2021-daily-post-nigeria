Brentford will play in the Premier League for the first time, after defeating Swansea in the Championship Play-off on Saturday. Thomas Frank’s side won 2-0 at Wembley. Ivan Toney opened scoring from the penalty spot before Emiliano Marcondes finished off a swift counter-attack. The victory seals Brentford’s place in the English top-flight for the first time since 1947. It is also redemption for Frank after they lost last season’s play-off final to Fulham. Brentford joins Norwich City and Watford as the three promoted teams ahead of the 2021/2022 season.
