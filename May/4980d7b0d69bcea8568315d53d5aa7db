Former Chelsea star, Joe Cole, has predicted the club that will win this season’s UEFA Champions League, UCL, between Manchester City and Thomas Tuchel’s side. Chelsea will, on May 29, tackle Man City in the Champions League final at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey. The Blues had eliminated Real Madrid from the Champions League semi-final stages a few days ago, while Pep Guardiola’s men knocked Paris Saint-Germain out of the competition. Providing his prediction, Cole told the All To Play For podcast by Coral bookmakers and Joe Media, “I thought watching the way Chelsea played against Real Madrid in their second leg at Stamford Bridge, they are all wrong for Manchester City. “They will cause them serious problems in the [Champions League] final. The whole team looks so together, everybody knowing exactly what is expected of them in their role, it was incredibly impressive. “When Pep [Guardiola] comes up against a back three, he usually plays a false nine and tries to pin back the opposition’s full-backs. “However, I think that Chelsea will be happy with that and they will back Kante to break up play and then Pulisic, Werner and Havertz can really hurt them. “I think Chelsea are all wrong for City and I think they will do it, I think they will win the Champions League.” Cole added, “I played in the all-English final against Manchester United in 2008 and it was the most horrible game. “It should have been the pinnacle of my club career, but I hated it. We were playing against our mates, and you never want to lose to your mates. Losing that night was the worst night of my career. “I look at the current Chelsea side and the English boys that I know, Mason Mount, Reece James and Callum Hudson-Odoi, and there is a fearlessness to them that we didn’t have in 2008. They can get the job done.”
