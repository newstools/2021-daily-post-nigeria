The Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola has been called upon to immediately make public statements of accounts of all local governments since February 2021. This call was made in a signed statement by Nurudeen Kofoworola Babaji, the Minority Leader of the Osun State House of Assembly and made available to DAILY POST in Osogbo. He said the reason for the demand is because it is important to know how much the councils have expended on personnel costs and how much is left in their respective accounts. The minority leader also called on the federal government to prevail on the state government to stop the milking of funds belonging to the local government, adding that the actions of Governor Oyetola has paralysed the closest government to the people by assuming sole control of their accounts. In his words, “It is not news to the people of Osun State that all 30 local government councils and the Area Office in the State have been without any recognised headship since February 6, 2021 when the tenure of the elected local government representatives expired. “This has therefore, affected greatly, governance at this level as ‘strangers’ are leading the councils and an end has practically been put to governance in the third tier of government. “The people of the state are finding it so hard to understand why it is taking eternity for the current state government under Gboyega Oyetola to constitute Caretaker Committee or even more appropriate, organise council polls as witnessed recently in neighboring Oyo State.” DAILY POST had reported that the Osun State Governor had via a memo froze all the accounts of the Councils on February 5, 2021.
