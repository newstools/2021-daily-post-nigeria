Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has promoted youngster Levi Colwill to the first-team squad until the end of the season because of Andreas Christensen’s injury, Goal reports. Christensen sustained a tendon problem during Chelsea’s 2-1 win against Manchester City earlier this month. The centre-back has not been able to train since then. However, Tuchel has now drafted Colwill in as cover for Christensen. Colwill has impressed for Chelsea’s development side this summer. Another player promoted is Billy Gilmour, but the Scottish youngster had an unhappy night as Chelsea lost 1-0 against Arsenal on Wednesday night. Gilmour was substituted at half-time by Tuchel, who sent on Callum Hudson-Odoi in his place and deployed Mason Mount in a deeper role.
