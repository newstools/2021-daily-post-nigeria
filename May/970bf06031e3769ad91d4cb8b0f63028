Former Liverpool star, Mark Lawrenson, has predicted today’s FA Cup final clash between Chelsea and Leicester City. Chelsea will on Saturday evening tackle Leicester City in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium. Thomas Tuchel’s men head to the game following a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on Wednesday at Stamford Bridge, while Leicester defeated Manchester United 2-1 on Tuesday at Old Trafford. Providing his prediction, Lawrenson expects Chelsea to beat the Foxes and win their ninth FA Cup. “I think they [Chelsea] will have too much for Leicester – the Foxes got a good win at Old Trafford on Tuesday, but that was against a weakened Manchester United side,” he told BBC. “It will be close, but, from what I have seen of Brendan Rodgers’ side in the past few weeks, I am not sure they have got enough about them to break down this Chelsea side.” “Having around 20,000 fans back inside Wembley will help, though, especially for whichever team falls behind and needs to be lifted to come back. I am still sticking with Chelsea to win it, though. They will create more chances, and they just have to take them.” The kick-off time for Chelsea vs Leicester City is 5.15 pm.
