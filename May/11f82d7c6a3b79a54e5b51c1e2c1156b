Civil rights activist, Shehu Sani, has advised the Kaduna State Government not to belabour itself declaring the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, President, Ayuba Waba, wanted. He said the seven-day warning strike, which began on Monday was legitimate and has its place in the Nigeria Constitution, which Governor Nasir El-Rufai swore to uphold. Sani’s comment followed the wanted declaration on Tuesday Waba by Governor El-Rufai. He condemned the invasion of Tuesday’s gathering of protesting workers by thugs which he believed were sponsored by the state government. In a statement, which he signed and sent to DAILY POST in Abuja, the ex-Senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District recalled how the ruling All Progressives Congress when an opposition protested at various times against the government of the day. He said: “The declaration of the NLC President wanted by the Kaduna State Government is needless. Strikes and protests are constitutional and fundamental rights of the Nigerian Workers. “The use of thugs to disrupt the workers peaceful protest in Kaduna today stands unreservedly condemned. It’s immoral and unconscionable to use thugs against trade union leaders. “The ruling party has enjoyed the freedom and rights to protest when they were an opposition, they should be tolerant of dissent and criticism. “Consistent and systemic use of violence against peaceful protests and criticism contributes to the rise of armed insurrection in the country. “Since the NLC action is a warning strike, there is window for dialogue to resolve the issue of the mass sacking of the Kaduna workers. “A strong and proactive labour union is needed to protect and safeguard democracy,” he concluded.
