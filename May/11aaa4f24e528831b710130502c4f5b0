Arsenal hero, Paul Merson, has told Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, not to play Timo Werner for the Blues’ Champions League final against Manchester City on May 29. Werner scored Chelsea’s opening goal in their 2-0 semi-final second-leg win against Real Madrid on Wednesday. But Merson wants Tuchel to instead feature Christian Pulisic against Man City because the American international is a better finisher and can cause Pep Guardiola’s men more problems. “Timo Werner scored a big goal for Chelsea against Real Madrid. But he shouldn’t play in the Champions League final,” Merson told Starsport. “Christian Pulisic should start against Manchester City – because he is a better finisher. “I’d be shocked if Pulisic doesn’t play. He can beat two or three players, and he’s better in front of goal than Werner. “I would play him against City this weekend and see how it goes. You won’t get ten shots a game against City, so you have to play your best finishers.”
