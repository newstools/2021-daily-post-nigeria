The leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has revealed three state governors on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, planning to decamp to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Primate Ayodele revealed that the Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Muhammed Matawalle, Governor of Enugu State, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, and their Abia State counterpart, Okezie Ikpeazu are planning to defect from PDP to APC. In a statement on Tuesday, the clergyman noted that Matawalle has made up his mind already, while Ugwuanyi and Ikpeazu are still contemplating defecting from PDP to APC. He warned that if the PDP’s reconciliation committee fails to work things out, they will eventually decamp to the APC. ‘’The Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Muhammed Matawalle has made up his mind to leave the PDP. He is 99 percent out, If the party does not manage its situation well, the Governor of Enugu, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, and the Governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu will follow suit. “They are currently contemplating and planning a strategy to leave the party, they are 40% out.’’ This is coming after the popular prophet made a prophecy days back that he foresees that PDP will lose more governors soon after the Governor of Cross River State, Ben Ayade decamped last week. Primate Ayodele made it known that six top members that include governors, senators and honourable will leave the party if the party leaders do not work things out.
