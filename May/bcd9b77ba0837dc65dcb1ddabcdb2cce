South Korea’s Ambassador to Nigeria, Kim Young-Chae has said the insecurity in Nigeria is an “internal issue” that Nigerians must discuss. Chae, speaking in Abuja, said Nigeria needs international cooperation mainly with its neighbouring countries to enhance its internal security and restore peace. He noted that if another country engages Nigeria, it would then be considered an international issue. The Ambassador said: “Security is a very sensitive issue. I know everyone is concerned about the insecurity in Nigeria but it’s Nigeria’s internal issue that should be discussed among Nigerians. “If another country engages Nigeria, that is another issue entirely which would be considered an international issue. “To solve the insecurity problem, Nigeria needs international cooperation mainly with its neighbouring countries to enhance its internal security. Nigeria must cooperate with Chad, Niger and other neighbouring countries to ensure cooperation.” The Ambassador further called for professionalism in the army, emphasising that the army is the centre that holds the society together. He said if the army is corrupt, then the possibility that a country will be corrupt is high. “In South Korea, we have a very strong defence which is rated number 6 in the world. Our military is very dedicated and there is little or no corruption in the system. “The military is the centre that holds any country together. If the military is corrupt, there is a high possibility that the whole country will be corrupt,” he said.
