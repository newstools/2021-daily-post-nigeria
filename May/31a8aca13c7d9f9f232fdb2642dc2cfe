The Premier League on Wednesday, confirmed that Manchester United’s home fixture with Liverpool, will now be played on Thursday, May 13. The game was called off last week, following fans’ protests inside Old Trafford. The new date means Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men will now play three matches in five days. The dates for the penultimate round of 2020/2021 Premier League games were also confirmed. United are away to Aston Villa on Sunday, May 9 and will now play Leicester City on Tuesday, May 11 at 6pm (previously Wednesday, May, 12) and Liverpool on Thursday, May 13 at 8.15pm, with both games at Old Trafford. To accommodate that rescheduling, Southampton vs Crystal Palace remains on Tuesday, May 11 but will kick-off at 8.15pm, Aston Villa vs Everton will still be played on Thursday May 13, but will now kick-off at 6pm. Manchester United vs Fulham has however been moved to Tuesday. The Premier League season will conclude on Sunday May 23.
