Manchester United captain, Harry Maguire, did not take part in their final training session before Wednesday’s Europa League final. Maguire joined the rest of the squad in flying to Gdansk yesterday. Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had initially been positive about the defender playing some part against Villarreal. However, Maguire headed to the dugout rather than the pitch, as his team-mates started training today. Anthony Martial and Phil Jones also didn’t travel with the squad due to injury. Solskjaer is facing some big selection decisions, including whether to start David de Gea or Dean Henderson in goal.
