No fewer than six persons have lost their lives in Ondo State following a clash between suspected cultists and members of the Oodua Peopleâ€™s Congress, OPC. The clash occurred in Owo, headquarters of Owo Local Government Area of the state. During the fracas which crippled activities in the town, two buildings were set ablaze at the Idasen and Ijebu axis of the town. Following the sporadic gunshots that rented the air during the mayhem, residents of the community scampered for safety for fear of being caught in the shootout between the cultists and members of the OPC. Our source said the crisis started in the community following attempts by some cultists to avenge the death of their members allegedly killed by the OPC group. The source added that about six persons were killed from both sides as guns and dangerous weapons were freely used. With tension still pervading the community where the crisis occurred, there are indications that cultists were mobilising in their numbers to attack OPC members in their homes. When contacted, the Chairman of the local government, Mr Olabade Adegbegi said normalcy had returned to the town and warned trouble makers to desist as the government would deal decisively with those fomenting crisis. However, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Tee-Leo Ikoro who confirmed the incident said only two people were killed during the fracas. While disclosing that properties were destroyed, Ikoro said men of the Nigerian Police, Army and Civil Defense Corps had been drafted to the town in a bid to return law and order. The police spokesperson added that the Commissioner of Police, Bolaji Salami had ordered an investigation into the development as well as the arrest of all those connected to the mayhem.
