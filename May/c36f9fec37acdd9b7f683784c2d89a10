Nigeria intelligence community have linked the assassination of former political adviser to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Ahmed Gulak, to the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The proscribed secessionist group, led by Nnamdi Kanu, now has a militant wing, Eastern Security Network (ESN). Security agencies have repeatedly linked the ESN to the killing of security personnel and destruction of government facilities in South-East and South-South States. After Gulak’s murder, an intelligence officer told PRNigeria that IPOB has been indicted. The officer disclosed they intercepted communication and saw videos where Kanu threatened anyone who fails to observe his sit-at-home order from May 29 to May 31 will die. “Why should Nigeria and the media continue to dignify IPOB by claiming that its continuous atrocities against the security services and Nigerians are executed by unknown gunmen when we have arrested their members confessing their involvements?” the officer said. Kanu, in a recent broadcast, declared the sit-at-home will commence 6p.m. on Saturday till 6p.m. on Monday. The IPOB leader warned that the order is compulsory and must be obeyed South-East people. “From 6p.m. on the 29th, there will be no movement, this is not sit-at-home but no movement. If you are found outside from 6p.m. you are dead”, he said. Gulak, an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, was killed in Owerri, Imo State capital on Saturday night. A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Adamawa and personal friend of Gulak, Dr. Umar Arɗo, confirmed the incident on Sunday. Assassination attempt on Gov.
