Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has kicked against the stance of President Muhammadu Buhari on the ban on open grazing in Nigeria. Masari in an interview with newsmen in the state on Tuesday, described the practice which causes herdsmen to move from place to place as “un-Islamic.” The governor rather advocated for the provision of the needed infrastructure that is causing the herders to keep junketeering about. He said, ‘’The herders’ movement is essentially in search of two things: water and fodder. If we can provide these two items why should they move? ‘’This roaming about, is un-Islamic and is not the best. It is part of the problem we are having today. I don’t support that we should continue with the open grazing.’’ He said. Recall that on 11 May 2021, the 17 Southern Governor’s met in Asaba, Delta State, and unanimously prohibited open grazing in Southern Nigeria. In the same vein, APC Southwest leaders, including the APC national leader, Bola Ahmed Tinibu, equally took sides with the governors on this burning issue. However, President Muhammad Buhari has been receiving knocks from Nigerians for kicking against the stance of the southern Nigeria leaders to ban open grazing in the region. The president, while reacting to the development, dismissed the governors’ declaration as having questionable ‘Constitutional legality’. North is not afraid of restructuring – Gov Masari
