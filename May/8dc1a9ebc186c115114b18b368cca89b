Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has revealed his plans after his lost 1-0 to Chelsea in the Champions League final. According to him, he will go away to see his family, after not seeing them for a long time. It has been a long season for Guardiola, who won the Carabao Cup and Premier League, but failed to deliver Europe’s biggest trophy. Guardiola said: “We arrived in the final of the Champions League, for us it was really good, we won the Premier League again and we competed incredibly well throughout the whole season. “Now, I want to go home with my family, for a long time I didn’t see them, take a break for one or two weeks and after, we start thinking about the club and what is best for the club in the next years and that is what we are trying to do.” Champions League: You won’t beat me again – Guardiola warns Tuchel
