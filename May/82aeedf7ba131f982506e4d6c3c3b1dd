Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has said he is “gutted” after they fell short in the defence of their LaLiga title. Karim Benzema and Luka Modric scored as Los Blancos fought from a goal down to beat Villarreal 2-1. But Atletico Madrid’s own comeback win against Real Valladolid was more than enough to snatch the title from their city rivals. It means that Madrid end the campaign trophyless for the first time in over a decade. “My mood is gutted. We didn’t win La Liga. If you ask me that, that’s the answer. “We have to congratulate Atletico, who deserve [to be champions], because whoever is at the top deserves it. “But the most important thing is what the [Real Madrid] players have done.I have to thank our fans because they have always supported the team from the outside. I think everyone can be proud of the players, because they have given everything,” Zidane told his post-match press conference.
