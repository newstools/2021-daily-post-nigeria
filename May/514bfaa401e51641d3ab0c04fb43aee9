The ban of open grazing by Southern governors has continued to generate reactions in Nigeria. This time around, popular activist, Aisha Yesufu took to her Twitter page commending the Southern governors for taking such decisions and standing on it. According to her, this will prove to the government that this country does not belong to one tribe but that every tribe/region has a right to make decisions. Recall that the Southern governors after a meeting, banned open grazing in the southern states of Nigeria. Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers state also made it clear that he will implement the ban on open grazing as resolved by Southern governors and vowed there is no going back on the decision. Aisha in a video on her Twitter page said: “ Dear Southern Governors, Una do well! For every North there is a South and no region has monopoly of being self centered and intolerant! “We all can be crazy and everyone has a bed in a psychiatric hospital. Na who wan occupy am dey go there! “I’m so proud of southern governors, let them keep making such decisions and having meetings and sending communiques. “They think it’s only Northern governors that have a day in this country . There’s so much insolence and disrespect in this country. “I see some people coming out to say the southern governors don’t have the right to make such decisions but yet hail northern governors for making decisions for their states. “You can’t be the one bringing the least to the table and any small thing you convene a meeting. By the time Southern governors start making decisions continuously like the Northern governors have been doing then we will know restructuring has informally started. They think violence is only from one side.” Buhari Govt already down – Aisha Yesufu reacts to Garba Shehu’s comment
