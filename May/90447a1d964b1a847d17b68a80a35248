Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers, has described their 1-0 win over Chelsea in the FA Cup final as a “classic” game and admitted he knew they would “suffer”. The Foxes beat the Champions League finalists 1-0, thanks to a stunning goal from Youri Tielemans in the second half. “I thought it was a really good game, a classic FA Cup final game. We were playing against the Champions League finalists so we knew it would be tough, we’d have to suffer. But I thought we were well worthy of the win. We pressed the game really well, took them to the side of the field we wanted to, and when we had the ball we showed courage with it. “I always felt we were a real threat in the game and when we got to 1-0… an amazing goal by Youri. And I’ve got to mention Kasper Schmeichel, that was also a really special save by a top-class goalkeeper. The players defended magnificently to keep a clean sheet,” Rodgers said afterwards.
