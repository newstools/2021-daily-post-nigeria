Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel has said his team “feels good” about facing Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City in the Champions League final and will beat them again. The Blues edged out City 1-0 in the FA Cup semi-final last month. They will face their Premier League rivals again in Istanbul on May 29, for the biggest prize in European club competition. While Tuchel insists their FA Cup victory over City doesn’t give them an upper hand, it does make them confident of a repeat performance. “No [it doesn’t give us] the upper hand, but it gives us a good feeling, it gives us confidence. We played the semi on the edge. They are the benchmark and we wanted to close the gap to Man City. We will need the same level of performance again. It gave us belief, because it is the highest level you can face. “We will arrive with self confidence and the positive energy in Istanbul, and we will arrive in Istanbul to win, not to be one of the participants. We arrive with a clear focus to win,” he said.
