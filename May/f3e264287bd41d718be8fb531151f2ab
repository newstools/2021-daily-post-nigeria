Following the gruesome murder of a former political aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, Ahmed Ali Gulak, in Imo State on Saturday evening, lawyers in Bauchi State, under the aegis of the Young Lawyers Forum (YLF), on Monday, urged the Federal Government to deploy sophisticated security strategies in the chaotic South-Eastern part of Nigeria and other areas facing security challenges. Reacting to Gulak’s murder in a statement signed by its chairman, Barrister Abbas Mu’azu and made available to journalists in Bauchi, the Forum expressed concern over the stance by the Northern Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) that Imo State governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, should produce Gulak’s killers within two weeks or reprisal attack would be carried out on Igbos in the North. While stating that although the killing of Gulak was painful, Barrister Mu’azu added that northerners should not retaliate as it could lead to anarchy in the country. The chairman stated that it was necessary to look at recent events leading to Gulak’s murder, saying that the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had issued a stay-at-home directive to the people of South-East before the sad murder. He then urged the South-East governors to not only condemn the activities of IPOB but also deploy the best known security strategies against its members. “We call on the Federal Government to deploy the most sophisticated security strategies in all parts of the country battling one form of security challenge or the other. “We equally call on the eastern governors to come out and join Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State in condemning the activities of the dreaded group (IPOB) and deploy the best known security strategies against its members,” Mu’azu stated.
