The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF, on Saturday, said the air mishap that killed the Chief of Army Staff, COAS, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru should be probed by relevant authorities. Speaking with DAILY POST, National President of AYCF, Yerima Shettima said findings of the probe should be made public for all Nigerians. Shettima made the call in reaction to insinuations that the aircraft carrying Attahiru may have been sabotaged. Attahiru and some other officers were killed in an aircraft mishap in Kaduna International airport, Friday. The COAS and his entourage were on an official assignment when the accident happened. Following his crash, some Nigerians said there was more to the death of the Army Chief who was appointed just six months ago. Reacting to the conspiracy, Shettima said: “One can not rule out the possibility of such but thank God that the Chief of Defence Staff has ordered a special investigation into the matter and we look forward to their findings, I don’t want to be pre-emptive of if something happened or not so let’s wait for the outcome of this findings. “I just hope this finding will be different from others because it’s easier for Nigerian leaders to ask for probe and it’s another thing to know the outcome of that investigation. Sometimes, you don’t get to hear anything about it. “Attahiru deserves honour, respect and the only way we can honour the death of this man who from all indication appeared to be more serious, proactive and determined to bring an end to insecurity is to ensure findings are made and everything is made clear to people on the cause of that accident. “I stated this because there are a lot of opinion about it but I don’t want to preempt anything; so let’s us wait first before going to the next level of action.” Arewa youths state position on Buhari not handing over to Osinbajo
