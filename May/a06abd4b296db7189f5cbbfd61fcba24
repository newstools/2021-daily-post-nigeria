The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has extended the deadline for the ongoing 2021 UTME/DE registration exercise by two weeks. The exam body took the decision after a meeting with stakeholders following reports of widespread delay in the registration process among candidates for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination. JAMB Registrar, Ishaq Oloyede, who announced the extension said the exam will now start on the 19th of June 2021 and end on the 3rd of July. Prof Oloyede also announced that the registration exercise will now end on May 29. This comes after the JAMB Board earlier announced itâ€™s contemplating an extension to the registration period and change of date for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination.
