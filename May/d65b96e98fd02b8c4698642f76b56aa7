Manchester United playmaker, Bruno Fernandes, has surpassed Frank Lampard by scoring against Liverpool on Thursday night. Fernandes gave the hosts an early lead, with his shot flying past Becker Alisson via a deflection off Nat Phillips. It took the Portugal international’s tally to 28 goals in 56 appearances across all competitions in the 2020/2021 campaign. This has seen the 26-year-old set a new record in English football. Fernandes has now scored more goals in a single season than any midfielder in Premier League history, beating the record previously set by Lampard at Chelsea in 2009/2010. He also now has 44 goal involvements in 50 top-flight appearances for United (26 goals, 18 assists), which puts him third in the club record books behind Eric Cantona (46) and Robin van Persie (45).
