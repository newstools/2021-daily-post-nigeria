Manchester United legend, Roy Keane has slammed midfielder Fred after his performance in the club’s 4-2 home defeat to Liverpool on Thursday. Keane also questioned why manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer continues to persevere with the Brazilian despite his ‘lazy’ attitude. The Brazilian endured a torrid evening as Manchester United fell to a 4-2 defeat at home to their arch-rivals. He struggled to keep possession of the ball and it was one of his wayward passes that resulted in Liverpool’s third goal early on in the second-half. Solskjaer replaced him shortly after the goal and former United captain Keane was not happy with his ‘lazy’ and ‘sloppy’ performance. “I know Ole perseveres with Fred but I can’t see it,” Keane told Sky Sports. “How they think Fred is going to get United back to winning titles I don’t know. I know he [Solskjaer] dragged him off but even so it was sloppy, it was lazy. It is school boy stuff. “[Harry] Maguire is a loss but these are school boy errors. Fred is under no pressure there and gives it away. Shaw is an experienced international player. “We are building the goalkeeper [Dean Henderson] up to say is he going to be the future no1 for United and they come up short. “Maguire is a loss but they are school boy errors, it has nothing to do with losing Maguire. “I think the fact they took Fred off was a bigger help.” Kane vs Haaland: Roy Keane tells Man United better striker to sign this summer
