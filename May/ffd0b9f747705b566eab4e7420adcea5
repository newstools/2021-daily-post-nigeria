Femi Fani-Kayode, a former minister of aviation has kicked against the recent statement of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, warning Southern governors against ban on open grazing in the region. Malami on Wednesday, describing the position of the Southern Governors as “indeed dangerous”, said they had no right to prohibit the liberty and freedom of movement of any Nigerian. According to him, the Southern governors declaration was as good as northern Governors coming out to ban spare parts trading in the North. Reacting, Fani-Kayode queried the Attorney general for comparing Fulani herdsmen to spare part dealers in the north. Stating the difference, Fani-Kayode mentioned that Fulani herdsmen are ‘bloodthirsty Terrorists’, while spare parts dealers are peace loving men who offer vital service not destruction. The former minister on his Twitter page wrote: “How the Attorney General can compare killer Fulani herdsmen to law-abiding spare part dealers beats me. “The former are bloodthirsty terrorists who have nothing to offer but death and destruction whilst the latter are peace-loving men and women who are providing a vital service.” Property worth millions of Naira destroyed as fire razes spare parts market in Ibadan
