A Christian group, Aba Elders Prayer Forum (AEPF), has decried the heavy militarization of Aba and Igbo land in general as well as its attendant collateral damages, calling on the youth to channel their agitations appropriately rather than attracting the attention of the military, which according to him, will destroy lives and property. The group which frowned at the number of Police checkpoints and Army formations between Aba and Umuahia said it was outrageous compared to the number of roadblocks when journeying from Kaduna to Abuja, warning that it may get worse in the South-East if the youth continue to invite the Army to Igbo land by ignoring the voice of the elders. The Elders Forum in a statement by its Chairman, Reverend Ndu Akuchie in Aba, urged Igbo youths to always seek the eldersâ€™ counsel before embarking on any action to avert damages to the nation and upon themselves. The Christain body reminded youths that the theatre of war suffers the greatest damage in war situations, positing that continuous neglect of elders advice on the agitations in the southeast, will further bring atrocities to a region that have already seen enough violence. The Aba Elders Prayer Forum decried the level of injustice in governance in Nigeria, pointing out that injustice should not be tolerated by anyone. The group maintained that God abhors injustice as his foundation anchors on justice, equity among others, admonishing leaders at all levels to provide quality leadership to quell agitations.
