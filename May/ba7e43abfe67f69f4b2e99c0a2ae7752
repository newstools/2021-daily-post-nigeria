Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said he wants to bolster his squad with “two or three” additions in the summer transfer window. Tuchel wants to improve his playing staff after winning the Champions League in his first six months in charge. Blues owner, Roman Abramovich bankrolled a huge spending spree in 2020, bringing in the likes of Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech, Kai Havertz and Edouard Mendy. Tuchel is hoping to chase down a number of targets, telling reporters on his recruitment plans: “Two or three could be very, very good. “It’s a constant thing to never deny change. “That you always bring new energy, new guys who question the old beliefs, who challenge everybody in the training and in matches, so I think it’s a good thing.” Chelsea: I’ll give my best – Kai Havertz makes fresh promise on new role
