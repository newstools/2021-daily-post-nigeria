But Prince Ado-Ibrahim who condemned their alleged disrespect to the dead soldiers in a post on his Instagram account called out the political leaders for not attending the burial of the military officers but chose to attend a wedding and merry. His post read, “Optics count in Politics and leadership. We see Misplaced priorities of those that were chosen as leaders at a time of war and a pandemic. “They prefer a show of power and pleasure over patriotism and prayer on this day. “The nation is watching. The people will have the last laugh. While the Nation is in shock at yesterday’s horrible deaths of our brave military men and while we are praying for our fallen heroes, some allowed themselves to be pictured as they were celebrating, he wrote. “Where did we go wrong. We need to Reset Nigeria. God bless Nigeria,” he wrote. Attahiru: Omokri reacts as Buhari, Osinbajo fail to attend burial of COAS, other military officers
