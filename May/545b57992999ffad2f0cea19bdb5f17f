In January 2021, the President, 76, was declared winner ahead of main challenger, Bobi Wine. The 76-year-old has been in power since 1986. He won presidential election with 59 percent of the vote; Wine polled 35 percent. Wine, real name Robert Kyagulanyi, has been mostly under arrest. The music star-turned-legislator accuses the authorities of abusing his right of freedom. After the election, the Uganda government blocked United States Ambassador Natalie Brown from visiting Wine.
