Juventus striker, Cristiano Ronaldo has posted a cryptic update on his future, suggesting he could be leaving the club. The Portuguese also informed his critics that he does not chase individual records but works hard each day to maintain a standard. Ronaldo finished top scorer of the Italian topflight this season, becoming the first player to do so in three major leagues. Despite Ronaldo’s goals, Juventus struggled this season and just scraped into the top four. “The life and career of any top player are made of ups and downs. Year after year, we face fantastic teams, with extraordinary players and ambitious goals, so we always have to give our best to keep ourselves at excellence levels. “I’ve already said that I don’t chase records, records chase me. For those who don’t understand what I mean by this, it’s very simple: football is a collective game, but it is through individual overcoming that we help our teams achieve their goals. “It is always looking for more and more on the field, working more and more off the field, that records eventually emerge and collective titles become inevitable, some being the natural consequence of the other.” He finished by saying: “Thanks to everyone who took part in this journey! We stand together!” There have been rumours linking the former Real Madrid superstar with a return to Manchester United, where he won his first ballon d’Or. Paris Saint-Germain are also said to be interested in the 36-year-old with Brazilian forward, Neymar, recently saying he wants to play alongside the Portugal captain.
