Chelsea are facing the prospect of points deduction, after they were charged with failing to control their players, the UK Mirror reports. Towards the end of their 2-1 win over Leicester City at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night, players of both teams clashed on the pitch. It is the seventh time in seven years the Blues are being punished. Leicester have also been charged for their part in the brawl, which saw players and coaching staff clash on the touchline, following Ricardo Pereira’s challenge on Ben Chilwell. Chelsea’s record is so bad that they were warned in July 2016 that they faced a points deduction, after appealing against a £375,000 fine levied against them for their part in a mass bust-up during a game with Tottenham two months earlier. Since then, they have been charged two more times for failing to control their players. However, the Blues escaped with fines and warnings about their future conduct. A former FA employee, with knowledge of the disciplinary process, said: “It seems there’s an issue within the club.” Chelsea and Leicester City have until Tuesday to respond to the charge. A possible deduction could have major implications for Chelsea, ahead of their final-day clash at Aston Villa, as they chase a Champions League spot.
