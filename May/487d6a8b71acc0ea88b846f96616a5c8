Iniubong Umoren, the job seeker murdered in Akwa Ibom State, was buried on Friday. Ini was reportedly killed and buried by the job advertiser who replied to her Twitter post, in April, about job opportunities.  The family now wants closure. Ini’s elder brother Ukeme Umoren made the demand when a delegation from Governor Udom Emmanuel paid a condolence visit to Ndot village in Oruk Anam Local Government Area. Ukeme told the delegation led by Emmanuel Ekuwem, Secretary to the State Government (SSG), that justice is the only thing that can placate the grieving family. He recalled how they lost their parents at a tender age and struggled to acquire university education. Ukeme confirmed that Ini was waiting for her call-up letter for the mandatory National Youth Service before her gruesome murder.  “She went to look for a job to keep herself going, pending the call-up letter, but the dream is shattered, we have lost our sister. “All we want is justice for our sister. Whoever is involved in this atrocity should be brought to book. “The young man (suspect) could not have done this alone. There are people behind the scene that sent him on these errands”, he said.  Ukeme told the Akwa Ibom government to do all within its power to bring those involved in the killing to book. Ini was the last child in the family. Her case is being monitored by Nigerian youths, many of whom, at different times, went to unfamiliar places in search of jobs.
