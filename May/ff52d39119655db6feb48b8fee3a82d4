President Muhammadu Buhari has met with security chiefs and top government officials at the Presidential Villa. In attendance at the meeting were General Leo Irabor, Chief of Defence Staff, Lt General Ibrahim Attahiru, Chief of Army Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo, Chief of Naval Staff; Air Marshal Isiaka Amao, Chief of Air Staff. The Acting Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, Director General of the Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi, also attended. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Secretary to the Government, Boss Mustapha, National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, Chief of Staff to the President, Ibrahim Gambari and Ministers, were also present at the meeting. The parley deliberated on insecurity in the country and steps being taken to curtail the situation. Nigeria has been dealing with violent security issues including kidnap, killings, terrorism and arson targeting personnel and facilities. Today’s meeting was held hours after the presidency confirmed the security breach at the State House. Garba Shehu, a spokesman, admitted there was an attempt to burgle Gambari’s residence, located across from the villa. The aide said the “foolish” act which occurred at 3:00am on Monday was unsuccessful. The development has, however, sparked outrage among Nigerians, who are wondering how the seat of power, the most guarded environment in the country, was infiltrated.
