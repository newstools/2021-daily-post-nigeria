The Zamfara State Police Command has said it has repositioned and strengthened the existing crime fighting strategies to end banditry in the state. The Commissioner of Police, Hussaini Rabiu, said he held an interactive meeting with all Police Tactical Commanders at the Police Command Headquarters, Gusau, the state capital. “The essence of the meeting was to enable the Commissioner of Police to have an overview of the operational strength and capacity of Police Tactical units deployed to various locations across the State. So, appropriate adjustments could be designed to enhance their performance” he said. “I have charged the Tactical Commanders to be alive to their responsibilities by ensuring constant supervision of their troops, so that members of the public can feel the impact of their deployment. He further called on them to be good ambassadors of the Force, through hard work and commitment, and also work in synergy with other security agencies and host communities,” Rabiu said. The commissioner said he equally warned that the Command under his watch will have zero tolerance for human rights violation, corrupt practices and other unprofessional conduct. He promised that the leadership of the command in collaboration with the state government will do everything possible to improve their welfare. “Any member of the Force who fails to adhere with the constitutional provision and other professional ethics of the Force will be decisively dealt with”, he added. The Command called on the general public to be law abiding and warn their wards against involving in any act of criminality, as the police will not fold its arms and allow unscrupulous elements to undermine the peace and security of the state. “Any useful information should be channelled to the office of the Commissioner of Police, or Area Commanders and DPOs across the State for prompt action” EFCC, DSS, Police strengthen ties against corruption in Nigeria
