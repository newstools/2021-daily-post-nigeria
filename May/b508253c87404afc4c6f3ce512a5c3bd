The All Progressive Congress (APC) in Ekiti State has congratulated the Muslim faithful in the state for the successful conclusion of Ramadan, one of the pillars of the religion. The party, in a statement released on Thursday by its Public Relations Officer, Hon Ade Ajayi, noted with satisfaction the prevailing peace in the state during the fasting period, which it attributed to total submission and adherence to Islamic tenets by its adherents. It pointed out that it is obvious that Muslims in the state used the period to pray against insecurity and other vices in the society. “Now that Ramadan is over, it behoves on us all to continue to be law-abiding and observe all safety measures to guard against any form of breakdown of law and peace. “We should also continue to pray fervently for the country to bounce back economically while insecurity will be a thing of the past,” the statement read. “Also, this period calls for more cooperation with the present administration in the state to continue to enjoy religious harmony and peaceful coexistence with one another.” The party assured residents that the Governor Kayode Fayemi-led administration would not shy away from its responsibilities, as well as put in place more measures to curtail the spate of insecurity in the state. It reminded Muslims to continue to adhere strictly to COVID-19 protocols in view of its resurgence in the country.
