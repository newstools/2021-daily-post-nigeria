Former Liverpool and Newcastle United manager, Rafa Benitez, has made it clear that coaching a topflight club in English is his priority, after leaving Chinese Super League side Dalian Pro. This is amid speculation that he will replace Jose Mourinho at Tottenham Hotspur. Benitez left Dalian Pro in January, citing COVID-19 as a factor in his decision. He was on a bumper contract worth a reported £12million per year at the Chinese club. “I moved to China because there were no top sides here, so I needed to keep competing and doing my job. “I’m watching every Premier League game and sometimes Championship games so that I’m always ready. The priority is England, the Premier League, my family is here… I like the style of football here. I’ll try to be ready here,” Benitez, whose home is in Liverpool, told Sky Sports.
