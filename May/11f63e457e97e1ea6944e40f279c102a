The Anti Vandal Squad of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Kwara, on Saturday, nabbed six suspected cult members in Ilorin. The Public Relations Officer, Babawale Afolabi in a statement said the corps made the arrest in collaboration with the state security outfit, Operation Harmony. Two rival cult groups, ‘Abata’ and ‘Aye’ had clashed at the Dada area of Okelele, Ilorin. ”It was a serious battle, but only six of them were apprehended”, the PRO noted. The conflict started during the Ramadan fast; two members of Aye were injured. NSCDC found that the Abata group decided to strike back today and met very close to a river in that area. Axes, cutlasses and knives and other dangerous weapons were recovered from the suspects. The statement added that the case will be transferred to the Police.
