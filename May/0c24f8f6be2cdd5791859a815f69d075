The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) says it stands by its earlier assertion that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is behind the burning of offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The PDP reiterated its position that the APC has been promoting acts of violence including arson in other to build an emergency situation and frustrate the smooth conduct of the 2023 general elections. Kola Ologbondiyan, National Publicity Secretary of the PDP in a statement on Tuesday, said having realized that it has no place in the 2023 election, APC leaders are seeking to set Nigeria ablaze and truncate democracy. The PDP told Nigerians to note the failure of the APC and its leaders to forcefully condemn the clear assault on the frontline institution of democracy. The spokesman added that the APC administration has failed to take decisive steps to protect INEC facilities from assailants. “Our party wants the APC to know that May 29, 2023 date is sacrosanct for it to leave office, free our nation from its stranglehold and fizzle out from our political firmament.” Ologbondiyan declared history will not be kind to APC and its leaders given the magnitude of atrocities they have committed against Nigerians in a space of six years. “The APC has destroyed our nation, opened our dear fatherland to bandits and terrorists, turned our nation into an expansive killing field and a large funeral parlour. ‘APC has wrecked our economy, opened our national vaults to its leaders to pillage over N15trillion and reduced our once thriving country to a beggar nation while mortgaging our future with humongous foreign debts.” The party called on the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba to immediately invite and question APC leaders over the attacks on INEC offices.
