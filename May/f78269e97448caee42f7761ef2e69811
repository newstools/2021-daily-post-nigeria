Nigerian Pastor, TB Joshua has sent a message of condolence to Pastor Enoch Adeboye and the Redeemed Christian Church Of God (RCCG) over the sudden death of Pastor Dare Adeboye. As DAILY POST reported, Dare, the third son of ‘Daddy G.O’, died in his sleep on Wednesday night at his home in Eket, Akwa Ibom State. Adeboye had sometime last year during his 42nd birthday described the deceased as a miracle child. According to Joshua, the sad event would not have happened if God did not permit it, adding that He needed no human’s approval to his will. “God does not need our permit; God’s time is the best,” the cleric said in a live broadcast on Emmanuel TV. “It is not how long we live that matters but how well we live,” he added He called on his congregants to pray for God to comfort and strengthen the family and the RCCG. “Let us observe a moment of silence in remembrance of Pastor Dare Adeboye,” Joshua concluded. RCCG had earlier announced that burial activities for Dare will commence on Sunday 9th May 2021. TB Joshua and Adeboye are among Nigeria’s most well known and influential pastors.
