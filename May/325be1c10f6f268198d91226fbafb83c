The Ogun State police command has commenced action on the recent gas explosions in Abeokuta, the state capital. The command said it worked with other security and government agencies to set up a technical investigative team. The job of the team, Oyeyemi said, was to unravel the causes of the explosions, which it said killed six and injured eight other persons. According to the command’s spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, two gas plants suspected to have supplied the gas and the cylinders have been sealed up. Oyeyemi told DAILY POST that samples of the gas from the plants were also taken for analysis by the Standard Organization of Nigeria(SON). The police warned welders and technicians to stop using oxygen gas simultaneously with cooking gas while welding. “Pending the outcome of the investigation, and in order to prevent further disaster, welders throughout the state are advised to stop using oxygen gas simultaneously with liquefied petroleum gas-LPG (cooking gas), while carrying out their welding jobs,” Oyeyemi stated. The command directed DPOs and Area Commanders to pass the information to welders, their associations and maintenance technicians in their respective jurisdictions, asking them to monitor compliance.
