Former Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Erica has revealed why she’s currently not in a relationship with anyone. Erica during an Instagram live session on Tuesday was asked if her fame had affected her love life in anyway. In her response, she revealed that men get intimidated lately because of her success. According to her, “No one approaches me anymore or even asks me out again.” “A lot of people feel intimidated, so I don’t get toasters anymore,” she said. She further revealed that she misses all her toasters, adding that they shouldn’t worry as she’s still the same girl and nothing has changed about her. “All my toasters I miss y’all. Please come back, nothing has changed,” she added. Recall that Erica earlier announced that she will be having her own reality Tv show. According to her, the show will be about her daily activities with family, friends and how she journeys through life with her acting career. Erica announces plan to start reality show
