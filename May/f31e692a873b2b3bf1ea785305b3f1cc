Manchester United striker, Edinson Cavani, has admitted the possibility of signing for Boca Juniors this summer “was real”. However, the 34-year-old insists speculation suggesting he was looking for a way out of Old Trafford was “half true, half lies”. Cavani has now singed a one-year extension with the Red Devils, shelving plan of returning to South America. The Uruguay international has netted 15 times in 36 appearances for United and will continue to star for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. On reports claiming that he was destined to head for Argentina at the end of the season, Cavani told 2 de Punta: “The possibility I was going to sign for them [Boca] was real, but I was always clear. “What has been said and printed is half true, half lies. Sometimes it’s like that – but the chance was real.” EPL: I want to leave something behind at Man Utd – Cavani
