The Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, has suspended the five-day warning strike in Kaduna State. The National President of NLC, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, stated this at an emergency meeting in Kaduna on Wednesday evening. According to him, the move was to honour the invitation of the Federal Government on Thursday. DAILY POST reports that the five-day warning strike was organized to protest against the administration of Governor Nasir El-Rufai over the mass sack of workers. However, the strike action and protest by the NLC has plunged the state into an unusual crisis as the state government and the Labour Union engaged in a face-off. The protest turned violent on Tuesday when thugs believed to be supporters of the state government hijacked the activities of the NLC.
