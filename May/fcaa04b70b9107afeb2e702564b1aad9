Chelsea left-back, Ben Chilwell, has identified teammate, Reece James, as the ‘brilliant’ player following the Blues’ 2-1 win over Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday. Marcos Alonso’s late goal gave Thomas Tuchel’s side all three points against Man City at Etihad. Hakim Ziyech had cancelled Raheem Sterling’s opener for Pep Guardiola’s men against Chelsea. But Chilwell, who was rested on Saturday, still took time to recognise the influential display of James. He wrote on Twitter: “Thought this guy was brilliant tonight Reece James!” The victory against Man City means Chelsea are now in the third position on the Premier League table with 64 points from 35 matches. Chelsea’s next match is against Arsenal on Wednesday. EPL: Ben Chilwell reveals Tuchel’s advice to Chelsea players on winning FA Cup, Champions League
