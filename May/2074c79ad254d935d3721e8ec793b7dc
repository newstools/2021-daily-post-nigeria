The Oyo State Independent Electoral Commission (OYSIEC) has suspended the ongoing local government election in Ido local Government Area. Our correspondent reports that the local government election which is currently ongoing in all the 33 local government areas in the state has been fixed for today (Saturday). DAILY POST, however, learnt that the election has been suspended in Ido local government area. Ido is one of the 11 local government areas in Ibadan, the state capital. It is one of the local government areas in Oyo South District. Our correspondent gathered that the election for the Chairmanship and Councilorship in all the wards in the local government area have been suspended. The suspension is necessary in view of the ommission of the logo of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) in the election. OYSIEC Chairman, Barrister Isiaka Olagunju confirmed the suspension of the election in the local government area. He said that the commission suspended the election due to the ommission of ZLP logo in the ballot papers. He added that the election will take place pending further directive. Olagunju who addressed journalists at the headquarters of the commission in Ibadan, said, “This was a serious error on our part. We have decided to suspend the election. “It will not be right when somebody is contending the election and his name is not there and we go ahead. “On this note, I want to announce that the election has been suspended in the local government area and whatever we decide in few hours, I will let you know.” Oyo LG election: SPN protests, kicks against exclusion of party from INEC list
