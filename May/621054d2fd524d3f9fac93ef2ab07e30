Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has admitted his players have been practising penalty kicks, ahead of Saturday’s Champions League final against Manchester City. Tuchel also mentioned the marathon penalty shoot-out between Manchester United and Villarreal last Wednesday in the Europa League final as inspiration. According to the German, he has “never seen anything like” it, with all 20 takers finding the net. Villarreal beat United 11-10, with goalkeeper, Geronimo Rulli firing home the winning spot-kick. When asked if Chelsea keepers Edouard Mendy or Kepa Arrizabalaga would be ready to step up to the spot if called upon, Tuchel replied: “Well I hope so. “We always practise penalties when we face a match where it’s possible it could go to penalties. “Can we simulate the pressure, the fatigue, the occasion, how it will feel tomorrow? No, we cannot. “But still we believe we can take care about some patterns, and about a certain rhythm and certain habits during penalties. Which we did.” How Diego Maradona practised ‘hand of God’ goal against England – Teammate, Valdano opens up
