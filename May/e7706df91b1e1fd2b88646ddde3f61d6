The Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, has charged parents and telecommunication Consumers on protection of children against fraudsters and other criminality on the cyberspace. The Director Consumer Affairs Bureau, NCC, Efosa Idehen gave this charge in Abuja on Thursday at the maiden edition of the Telcom consumer market conversation, at the Garki International Market, Abuja. Efosa said though ICT plays a key role in socio-economic development, care must be taken to ensure that children pick the right information on the Internet. The Director also warned against the use and sale of pre-registered SIM Cards, saying that anyone caught doing so will be made to face the law. According to him, “Those who trade in and use pre-registered SIM cards pose serious threat to our individual and collective safety because such criminal elements hid their real identities while using such SIM cards to perpetrate nefarious activities such as kidnapping and financial crimes in the society. “The Commission urges consumers to report infractions of the SIM registration laws and guidelines to law enforcement agencies because it is a noble civic responsibility to do so and a worthy support to NCC’s efforts in eradicating such dangerous activities in our society,” he concluded. The NCC plays a vital role in National Security and works very closely with the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), Security Agencies, the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, MNO’s and other relevant bodies in ensuring security. The Commission also, among other things, intervened in nipping the cases of call masking and call retilling in the bud.
