The Medical and Health Workers’ Union of Nigeria (MHWUN) has condemned the attack on workers by hoodlums in Kaduna. A protest on Wednesday against the mass sack by the Nasir El-Rufai-led government was interrupted. Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige confirmed that arrests were made and investigation ongoing. The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and its affiliates had commenced a five-day strike over sack of 4,000 workers. The industrial action was called off after the intervention of the federal government. Biobelemoye-Joy Josiah, MHWUN National President in a statement alleged that El-Rufai unleashed thugs against unions. He said El-Rufai’s attitude against workers “whose only offence is that they chose to serve their fatherland diligently with all man-made inconveniences is most unfortunate. ”We are angered that even in the face of this deprivation, we are being provoked and humiliated.” Josiah noted that peaceful picketing was guaranteed under section 43 of Trade Union ACT CAP T14 LFN 2004. The MHWUN leader reminded state governments that the law was affirmed at the Supreme Court. “The illegal actions by the governor which is being challenged by the NLC include the retirement of officers who are 50 years of age and above”, he said.
