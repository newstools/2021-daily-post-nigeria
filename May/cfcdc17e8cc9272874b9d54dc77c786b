Barcelona feels used by Neymar after the forward renewed his contract with Paris Saint-Germain until the summer of 2025. This is according to Mundo Deportivo. Neymar left the Nou Camp in 2017 but was rumoured to be keen on a return to Spain. However, the 29-year-old has ultimately decided to stay with the Ligue 1 side. Barca feels Neymar used them as a bargaining chip to get the deal he desired from PSG. The Catalans believed they could strike a deal for the Brazil international and an emissary was even dispatched to Paris one month ago to speak with Neymar about his future. Neymar reportedly expressed his desire to return to Barcelona, because he did not feel there was a winning project in place at the Parc des Princes. He spent four seasons with Barca after joining from Brazilian side Santos in 2013 and was an integral part of the side that won two LaLiga titles, one Champions League and a Club World Cup.
