The Ogun State Judicial Panel of Investigation on Police Brutality, Human Rights Violations and Extra Judicial Killings said it had treated 58 petitions within its six months period. The panel sitting at the Magistrate Court 1, Isabo, Abeokuta, disclosed that it ended its sittings at the end of April. The Panel Chairman, Justice Solomon Olugbemi (rtd), in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Monday by the panel media person, Femi Osipitan, said “the panel received a total of 106 petitions.” Out of the 106 petitions, “58 were treated and the remaining 48 were either withdrawn, rejected or abandoned wholly or half-way by the petitioners,” it was learnt. Justice Olugbemi informed that some petitions were rejected because they were not in line with the terms of reference given to the panel by the state government. The Chairman assured all petitioners and respondents of justice without fear or favour. According to him, the panel’s report is ready for submission to government, adding that after submission, it is left for government to either implement the report or not. It would be recalled that the Panel was inaugurated on October 19, 2020 by Governor Dapo Abiodun and was given a six-month period to receive and investigate petitions from members of the public, whose human rights have been violated by security personnel within the state and also to make appropriate recommendations to government.
