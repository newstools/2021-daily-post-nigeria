Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has hinted that he might sign a new striker this summer, despite Edinson Cavani extending his stay for one more season. Solskjaer was asked about his plans for the transfer window, after it emerged Tottenham centre-forward Harry Kane wants to leave the North London club. Although Cavani has signed a one-year extension, Solskjaer admits there could be room for another striker in his squad. “Of course I can’t [rule out signing a striker]. “Yeah, Edi signed but how many good strikers have we had at this club? “I can’t say we’re not signing a striker, of course not. Because we’re building towards a better squad, we’re top three two years on the bounce but not where we want to be. “Hopefully we end up with a stronger squad when we start next season and be more consistent to challenge the one in front of us,” said Solskjaer following the 1-1 draw with Fulham on Tuesday.
