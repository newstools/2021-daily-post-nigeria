Former Real Madrid striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Chelsea to beat Zinedine Zidane’s side when both teams clash in Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final second-leg tie at Stamford Bridge. Owen expects Chelsea to qualify for this season’s Champions League final ahead of Real Madrid and face Manchester City. Chelsea had played a 1-1 draw with Real Madrid in the first-leg last week in Spain. Providing his prediction, Owen told BetVictor, “Onto Wednesday night’s match where Chelsea have a huge opportunity as they take on Real Madrid at Stamford Bridge. “This is the type of game where Thomas Tuchel thrives. With an away goal in the bag, he is sure to have his side well drilled with the aim of giving nothing away. If Chelsea are happy to sit in, I think there is every chance they could nick one on the break against a Madrid defence that’s looked shaky in recent weeks. “With that in mind, I’m siding with the Blues’ to go through and make it a second all English UEFA Champions League final in three years.” The kick-off time for Chelsea vs Real Madrid is 8 pm.
