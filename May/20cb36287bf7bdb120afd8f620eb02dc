The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has assured Nigerians that the country is in safe hands, in spite of the current security challenges. Mohammed gave the assurance while receiving the Oluyin of Iyin-Ekiti, Oba Adeola Adeniyi Ajakaiye in his office in Abuja on Thursday. He urged “Nigerians not to succumb to the apocalyptic or doomsday predictions about the country because such predictions won’t come to pass.” In a statement forwarded to DAILY POST by his Media Aide, Segun Adeyemi, the Minister appealed to leaders at all levels to give the people a message of hope instead of making comments that can only aggravate tension. Mohammed stressed the critical role of traditional rulers in the maintenance of peace and security, saying “they cannot and must not be ignored, as the nation seeks to restore peace and security across the country.” Responding to a request by the traditional ruler to help put the tourist sites in the town on the national and global map, the Minister pledged his readiness to leverage the media and technology to showcase and popularize the historic ‘Esa Cave’ as well as the ‘Okuta Abanijorin’ (the rock that accompanies you on your trip), both foremost tourism sites in Iyin-Ekiti, in the Irepodun/Ifelodun local government area of Ekiti State. ”Putting the tourist sites on the national and global map will attract tourists, which will in turn boost the economy of not just Iyin town but indeed the entire Ekiti State,” he said.
