The Rivers State Police Commissioner, Friday Eboka has advised residents to ignore the sit at home order declared by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, (IPOB). The leadership of IPOB had announced a series of activities to be held from the Saturday 29th of May to the 31st of May 2021, coupled with a sit at home order in honour of the Biafran people killed during the Nigerian civil war. The group said there would be consequences for anyone who flouts the sit at home order. But the Rivers State Police Commissioner through a statement by the command’s spokesman, Nnamdi Omoni told residents to disregard the directive, describing it as an affront on the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Omoni, in the statement, said “The attention of the Rivers State Police Command has been drawn to “A SIT- AT- HOME ORDER” issued by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) directing people not to go out to carry out their lawful activities from 29th to 31st, May 2021″. “The Command views this as unlawful and has therefore decided to allay the palpable fears occasioned by the phantom Order”. The Commissioner of Police reassured the residents of the State, that adequate security measures have been put in place to ensure lawful activities proceed unhindered in a conducive atmosphere. The police command noted that the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria recognizes “only the Executive President and Executive Governors as the only Authorities that can issue such Orders”.
