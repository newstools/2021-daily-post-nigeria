Enorsco Petroleum Filling Station located on Agbani-Akpugo Road, Enugu State was in the early hours of Friday razed by fire. The state’s Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Daniel Ndukwe, who confirmed the incident to newsmen in a statement, said that a combined team of police, Enugu State Fire Service and law-abiding citizens successfully put out the fire without any casualty. “The fire, suspected to have been caused by a leakage in the fuel tank of the filling station’s power generating set, gutted a tanker truck discharging its Dual Purpose Kerosene content into an underground tank. “The fire also gutted an iron-housing-container and an unspecified number of empty Gee-Pee tanks displayed within the premises of the filling station, before it was promptly put out by the combined team,’’ he said. Ndukwe said that the state’s Commissioner of Police, Mr Mohammed Aliyu, had ordered a full-scale investigation to further ascertain the actual cause of the incident and damages incurred,” NAN reports.
