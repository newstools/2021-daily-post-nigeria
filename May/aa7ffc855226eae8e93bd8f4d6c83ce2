Dino Melaye, former Kogi West Senator, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to declare he is medically, physically and politically incapacitated to govern the country amid the state of security challenges in the country. Melaye, who made this known on Friday during a programme (Focus) on AIT, also called on the National Assembly to impeach Buhari. According to him, when Buhari is impeached, Nigerians can now organize the security architecture of this country. He said, “The solution to this problem is simple, either the National Assembly become born again and impeach the President or the President agree that he is Medically, Physically, and Politically incapacitated and then hand in the towel. “Then we can now begin to rejig this country, we can now begin to work on the security architecture of this country. “We can now begin to say, ok let us even hold a national conference or something to create a way for us to get out from this insecurity problem.” Recall that the nose-diving security situation in Nigeria is increasingly putting President Buhari under pressure as prominent Nigerians, among whom are governors, former political office holders, clerics and Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, have started to speak out in condemnation of his alleged inaction. The past three weeks have particularly been traumatic for the country, with killings, abductions and attacks on communities and security agencies, especially as the killing of police officers continues unabated. Within the period, bandits operating in Kaduna State invaded a private institution in the State, Greenfield University in Chikun Local Government Area, abducted more than 20 students and killed a staff member during the attack. In a gruesome move, the bandits, who asked for N800 million ransom, have killed five of the students to show that they meant business.
