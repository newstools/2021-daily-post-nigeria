Two men were on Tuesday arrested by men of the Ogun state police command while on their way to a robbery operation. The suspects, 20 year- old Rasheed Ayinde and Matthew Oladipupo who is 33, were arrested around 9:30pm at the Onipanu area of the state. The Ogun State police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, informed DAILY POST that the suspects were on a motorcycle when they were apprehended during a routine patrol of the area by his men. “On sighting the policemen, they attempted to make a u-turn but they were stopped by the team who suspected their movements. “A search was there and then conducted on them and one locally made pistol and one live cartridge, as well as assorted charms, were recovered from them,” Oyeyemi said. On interrogation, the suspects confessed to being on their way to carry out a robbery operation. Oyeyemi said the duo claimed to be residents of Abeokuta, but operate in Onipanu and Atan Ota area.
Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun has ordered the transfer of the suspects to state CIID.
