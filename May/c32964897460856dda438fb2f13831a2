The All Progressives Congress (APC) has denied the allegation by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) regarding the burning of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) offices ahead of the 2023 general elections. The party insists it is continuously doing everything necessary for the country’s progress and defence of its democracy. The Secretary, John Akpan Udoedehe, in a statement said lies against the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government proved the PDP is behind the destruction of public institutions. The scribe declared it was all in a desperate bid to destabilise the Federal Government. The APC said it refrained from commenting on the “sponsored attacks” on INEC facilities in order not to pre-empt investigations. The ruling party urged security agencies to act fast and decisively against enemies of democracy and haters of a legitimately elected government. “The PDP thinks Nigerians have forgotten its long and documented penchant of eroding and destroying democratic institutions,” he said. “Was it not the same PDP that attempted to discredit INEC and the 2019 election with a bogus tale of a server that never existed and employed hackers to disrupt the communication network of the electoral body?” The APC said it could not be at home and burn its house, adding that a winner cannot destroy the process that brought it to success. Udoedehe noted that Nigerians spoke clearly through their votes for the APC and mandated it to rescue the country from PDP’s “16-year misadventure”. The scribe advised the opposition to address itself to the reality that it stands rejected by the electorates. Ranching: Anyone against Southern Govs’ resolve has hidden agenda – Ortom
