Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger has reacted to the club’s 1-0 loss to Leicester City during the FA Cup final. Rudiger expressed disappointment that Chelsea lost the FA Cup final to Leicester. Leicester City emerged victorious following Youri Tielemans’ stunning long-range strike and surviving a late VAR drama when a Ben Chilwell effort was ruled out for offside. Reacting, the Blues defender said it would have been better for the club to exit the competition at the knock out stage than kissing the final. In a post on his verified Facebook page, the German player vowed that Chelsea would fight back in their next matches. He wrote: “Losing a cup final feels more disappointing than being knocked out in an early round to be honest but this game won’t ruin the self confidence we’ve gained during the last months. “Only one way: Chin up and fight back in our next crucial matches ahead #Hustle #AlwaysBelieve Chelsea Football Club.” Chelsea will still face Leicester City on Tuesday.
