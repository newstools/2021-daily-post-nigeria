Members of the People Democratic Party (PDP) in Cross River State have continued to jubilate over the defection of Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State to All Progress Congress (APC). They claimed a major obstacle in the way of proper functioning of the party in the state has removed himself. “Stakeholders can now meet and organize the party the way political parties are organized” they stated. Regretting the action of Gov Ayade, Ntufam Mba Ukweni (SAN) told DAILY POST on Friday, “We should go for Thanksgiving for his exit. He would have thoroughly messed up the 2023 electoral process of the party. We can now chart a proper cause for the Party. “I say big congratulations to all well-meaning members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in Cross River State. A major obstacle in the way of proper functioning of the party in the state has removed himself. “We can now chart a proper cause for the Party. If APC members believe that having the Governor of Cross River State, Ben Ayade, has added value to their party, then, they have made a mistake. He will certainly not fund the party and will not allow it to function properly. “He does not believe in things being done properly. He encourages only those things that favour him personally and nothing more or less. I pity APC because whatever is left of the Party will be crushed finally. “He is not joining APC for the interest of the state but for his own interest. We are all here and by the grace of God, we will see it. I warned the Party, PDP not to give him a ticket for a second term and Cross Riverians not to give him a second term having failed in the first term. He was not speaking for Cross River State but for himself” he stated. Defection: Ayade says more Govs will dump PDP soon, lists those to join him in APC
