Leaders of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Oredo Ward 2, in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State have approved the relocation of its party secretariat, citing administrative convenience. This may not be unconnected with the current uncertainty surrounding the party in the state where various LGA executives have been engulfed in hullabaloo, protest for and against. This was made known in a 3-point communiqué issued by the party leaders in Ward 2, in the local government and read by one of the leaders, Mr. Victor Enoghama in Benin City, the state capital. They announced that a Committee will be set up to search for a befitting Ward 2 secretariat within four weeks after a voice affirmation by leaders of the party at the enlarged meeting which was held at the former secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on 59, Airport road in Benin City. Part of the Communique reads: “We the Leaders and members of PDP Ward two in Oredo Local Government do hereby support the position of the Leader of the party, His Excellency Godwin Obaseki on the proper integration and harmonization of all party members at all levels of the party administration and structure. This will promote peace and unity in the party”. The leaders also passed a vote of confidence on Governor the state Godwin Obaseki as the leader of the party in Edo State and commended him for his good work, infrastructural and human capital development.
