Dino Melaye, former Kogi West Senator, has accused the state Governor, Yahaya Bello, of short changing councilors in the state. Melaye alleged that Melaye was paying councilors N140, 000 instead of N330,000 monthly. The former lawmaker made the allegation in a tweet, on Tuesday. He pointed out that the councilors can not cry out because they were all appointed the governor. In a tweet, Melaye said: “Salary for councilor statutory N250k per month (sitting allowance N80k per month N10k per sitting 8 sitting in a month). N330k per month “But the present Councilors in Yahaya Bello government earned N140k per month, no sitting allowance. They can’t fight it since they were all appointed.” This is coming at a time the President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan backed the call for local governments’ autonomy in the country. Lawan said such autonomy would help the third tier of government to effectively contribute towards the development of Nigeria. He stressed that over the years, local governments have suffered and crumbled due to lack of administrations to effectively discharge their constitutional roles.
