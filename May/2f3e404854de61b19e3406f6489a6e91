Former Arsenal midfielder, Aaron Ramsey, is set to return to the Premier League. However, according to TuttoJuve, Ramsey might be leaving Juventus for Liverpool. The Reds are exploring the option of bringing the Welshman to Anfield ahead of the 2021/2022 season. Juventus are keen to part with Ramsey this summer. The deposed Italian champions could accept an offer as low as £10 million in order to get a deal done. Ramsey, 30, has been hampered by injuries this campaign and has started just 12 of the club’s 27 Serie A matches so far.
