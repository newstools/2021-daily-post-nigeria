The planter of Christ Apostolic Church, Prophet Sam Olu Alo, has commiserated with the Family of Pastor and Mrs. Enoch Adejare and Funmilayo Adeboye as well as the entire church of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), on the passing of their son, Pastor Dare Adeboye who died in his sleep on May 5, 2021. While urging the Adeboyes and the RCCG family to repose their confidence in the Lord and be comforted in Him and His abundant mercy, Prophet Alo said only the Almighty who is the author of destinies has designed what He deems fit for everyone. He said: “The Lord Almighty reminds us in Psalm 9:9 that He is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble. We pray that the Lord Almighty shall continue to remain our Baba and Mama Adeboye’s refuge, their stronghold in times of trials such as this. The Lord Almighty also assures us in Psalm 18:2 that He is our rock, our fortress and our deliverer, our God is our rock, in whom we take refuge.” Reflecting on the life and the pastoral endeavours of late Pastor Dare Adeboye, Prophet Alo described him as a great soldier of the Lord Almighty and a greater son of Zion whose zeal and love for working in the Lord’s vineyard is unparalleled. Our greatest joy in the Christendom is that late Dare Adeboye has finished strong and is now resting eternally in the Lord’s bosom in paradise. We also pray that the family he left behind receives divine comfort and lasting fortitude to bear the irreplaceable loss. Buhari reacts to death of Pastor Adeboye’s son, Dare
