The Benue State Government has expressed anger over the remarks of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba on the attack on Governor Samuel Ortom’s convoy. The governor’s spokesman, Terver Akase said the IGP seemed to have contradicted an earlier position of the Force. Baba was quoted as saying that “investigations so far are contrary to the claims made by Governor Ortom”. In a statement, Akase noted that the state government wants to believe that the Police chief was misquoted. “This is because the investigative team the office of the IGP deployed to Benue after the assassination attempt on the Governor confirmed the identities of the attackers as armed Fulani herdsmen. “It is therefore shocking that the IGP has come out with a contrary statement to that of his investigative team”, he said. Akase recalled that less than 24 hours after the attempt on Ortom, the Fulani Nationality Movement (FUNAM) claimed responsibility. The aide wondered why the Police IG was “still searching for the killers elsewhere without inviting members of the group for questioning”. The state government urged the Police to go after the perpetrators and make them face the full weight of the law. Bring an end to banditry, insecurity in Nigeria – Northern Govs tell IGP
