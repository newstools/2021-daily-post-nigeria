Gunmen have reportedly invaded a Sharia Court in Bauren Zakat village in Safana Local Government Area of Katsina State and kidnapped a judge identified as Alhaji Husaini Sama’ila. DAILY POST gathered that the incident occurred at about 3pm on Tuesday. It was, however, unclear why the judge was in court amid the industrial action embarked upon by the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN). Recall that JUSUN embarked on an indefinite strike on April 6 demanding the financial autonomy of the judiciary. When contacted by DAILY POST correspondent on phone, the Kastina State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Gambo Isah, confirmed the incident. He, however, expressed shock on the assignment that took the judge to the court citing the strike action by JUSUN. The PPRO said the court had been relocated from the area to Safana due to security issues, stating that he must have been there for a personal issue.
