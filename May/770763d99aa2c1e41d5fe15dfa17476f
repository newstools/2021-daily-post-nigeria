Former Arsenal star, Ian Wright, has urged Manchester City striker, Sergio Aguero, to join Chelsea when he eventually leaves Etihad this summer. Aguero will leave Man City once his contract expires this summer, having spent over a decade at the Premier League leaders. But Wright believes the Argentine international would benefit from having Mason Mount, Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic and Callum Hudson-Odoi around him at Chelsea. “Can I throw something out there? He should go to Chelsea,” Wright said on the podcast. “When you look at Edinson Cavani [at Manchester United] and the pace of the guys behind him, you look at Luis Suarez at Atleti, the pace and everything they’ve got around him. “Can you imagine Aguero up top for Chelsea with Mason Mount, Kai Havertz, all those guys, [Callum] Hudson-Odoi, [Christian] Pulisic around him, that’s 25 goals. “Me, if I’m Chelsea and I can get him for free, I’m going in. “I have fabricated this all in my head that he’s vexed with Pep [Guardiola] and it’s the kind of thing where he’ll say, ‘Yes, I am going to go to Chelsea’.”
