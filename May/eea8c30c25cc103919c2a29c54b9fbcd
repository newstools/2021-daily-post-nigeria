At least, 22 underaged girls of Akwa Ibom State of origin were on Friday rescued from a prostitution home in Ogun State, DAILY POST reports. The girls were said to have been lured from Akwa Ibom to Ogun State with phony offers of employment. Some of them said they were brought to the Gateway State to work as sales girls, but they were later locked in different rooms to work as prostitutes. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the arrest to DAILY POST on Saturday. Oyeyemi said the rescue operation was coordinated by the Area commander of Ota, ACP Muhideen Obe, having gathered credible intelligence. Obe had been informed that minors were being recruited from other states and used as commercial sex workers at one KOLAB hotel in Itele Ota. The police team, according to Oyeyemi, stormed the said hotel at about 8pm, “where the 22 teenagers, whose ages are between 10 and 14 years were rescued.” “On interrogation, the girls narrated how they were lured from their respective villages in Akwa Ibom State to come to Ogun State, with the promise to employ them as sales girls in restaurants and supermarkets, only for them to get to Lagos and got transferred to a brothel in Ogun State as commercial sex workers.” The girls, according to the police spokesperson, narrated that “they were deprived of using phone or any communication devices, thereby making it impossible for them to reach out to their parents or relations.” DAILY POST learnt that the manager of the hotel, one 33-year-old Isaac Ogbaji and 10 other male suspects were arrested during the operation. Meanwhile, the Ogun Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, has ordered that the family support unit of the Ota Area command rake over the investigation of the case. The unit is to identify the recruiting cartel and bring same to justice as soon as possible.
