Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said his players hate him for his constant rotation. For their away clash against Newcastle United on Friday night, Guardiola made a few changes to his starting XI. The Spaniard went for a front three of Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus and Ferran Torres. Torres netted a sublime hat-trick as City won 4-3 and Guardiola has defended his decision to always rotate, as they eye a stunning Treble with the Champions League final against Chelsea on May 29. “The season is long. We cannot play the season with just 11 players. The best striker we can buy, we cannot play all the minutes because of injuries, a lot of games. ‘You have to have 15, 16, 17 top players and after that the academy, lots of interesting players who can help. “That’s why the players hate me because they want to play every single day, but sometimes it is not possible because when you have all these alternatives, sometimes it is difficult to let the same players play,” he said.
