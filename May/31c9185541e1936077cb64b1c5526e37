Chelsea coach, Thomas Tuchel, has revealed the only way striker, Timo Werner, will get better at the club. Tuchel said Werner can take his performances up a level at Stamford Bridge with the help of Chelsea’s supporters. Werner joined Chelsea from Leipzig for £53million last summer. The German international has endured a frustrating first campaign at Chelsea, scoring just six goals in the Premier League and failing to show his true class in a season played without spectators. But Tuchel believes Werner will relish playing in front of a crowd at Chelsea, adding that the support of the Blues’ fans can help him and other players overcome difficult moments Speaking during his pre-match press conference on Friday ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League final game of the season against Aston Villa on Sunday, Tuchel told reporters: “I spoke about it with the board in our very first talks that I had the feeling it was a young team and looking at the characteristics from outside – not just with Timo – that the board shouldn’t forget the influence of not having the supporters helping them overcome difficult moments in matches. ” [Timo] He’s still young and can still improve. This is what we demand every week. When he has some time to rest, sometimes on holiday for mental rest, I’m sure he can take the next steps next year. “He’ll know the environment, what he’s up against, how to adapt. We try to push him now because we need that. “Many goalscorers in Europe take penalties for their team and it is usual that their high numbers have penalties. If we had penalties in his number everyone might be happy with his numbers.” Champions League: Timo Werner sets two records as Chelsea eliminates Real Madrid
