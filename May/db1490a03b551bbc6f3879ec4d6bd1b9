Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has claimed he will not speak “one word” to his players about Paris Saint-Germain. City go into Tuesday’s second leg of their semi-final with PSG holding a 2-1 lead. Speaking at a news conference on Monday, Guardiola insisted he won’t give detailed team talks to his team on how to stop Kylian Mbappe before kick-off. “Just focus on what we have to do, I didn’t speak one word about them. “They can change shape, their manager [Mauricio Pochettino] is so clever,” Guardiola said. Mbappe has not been able to train ahead of the game, but had made the trip from Paris to Manchester on Monday. The France forward missed the 2-1 victory over Lens in Ligue 1 on Saturday because of a calf injury.
