Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has granted freedom to 123 prisoners across the state to mark the Eid-El Fitr celebration. The governor witnessed the release of the inmates from Goron Dutse Prison on Thursday. Ganduje explained that the beneficiaries were selected based on the gravity of offences and good behavior. The Kano helmsman said the gesture was to complement the federal government efforts to decongest correctional centres in Nigeria. Ganduje advised the ex-inmates to turn a new leaf and pray for peace in the country. The governor gave each of the freed inmates N5,000 as transport fare to their destinations. Comptroller â€Žof Prisons in Kano, Suleiman Suleiman, warned those released to stay off crime.
