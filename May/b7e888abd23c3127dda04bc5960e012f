Chelsea have won this season’s Champions League after defeating Manchester City 1-0 in Saturday’s final. Kai Havertz scored the winner in the first half, latching onto Mason Mount’s through ball to round Ederson and tap home. This is the second time the Blues are winning the trophy, after they lifted it in 2012, when they beat Bayern Munich on penalties. It is, however, the first time Thomas Tuchel is winning it, after he lost last year’s final to Bayern. For Pep Guardiola who won it twice with Barcelona, the wait continues.
