President Muhammadu Buhari has been accused of being indifferent to the sufferings of Nigerians and unwilling to provide leadership in addressing killings across the country. Speaking at the one-day National Day of Mourning in Minna, the Niger State capital, the State Coordinator, Mr. Mathew Oladele said there is a growing toll of massacre, industrial scale abduction and lawless abuse of Nigerians all over the country. According to him, “This week alone over 130 people were massacred in two separate incidents in Benue and Plateau states, without drawing a response from the president. The incessant killing of security Officers across the country and the clear absence of political will or leadership from the president to bring this deadly trend to an end. “The surge in atrocities against women, children, learner’s, teachers, and the most vulnerable schools and instructions of learning have been targeted to elimination and the Government appears unable and unwilling to take urgent action in protecting these demographics.” He decried the deployment of the military in the country to handle internal security operations, thereby retrenching the constitutional role of the Nigeria Police Force. “The rise in fatalities from military operations shows that the military is over-stretched, poorly trained for this role and without proper rules of engagement for it. This cannot continue,” Oladele said. The state Coordinator further explained that the National Day of Mourning is a day set aside to remember all those who have lost their lives to violence and also show solidarity with their families and communities. While commending the efforts of Niger State Governor, Alh. Abubakar Sani Bello in addressing security challenges in the state, urged him to get across to families, especially those of security personnel who lost their lives as a result of violence in the state.
