The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Thursday, warned political parties, including the APC and PDP, to stay away from engaging in premature campaigns ahead of the 2022 governorship election or risk being sanctioned. Dr Adeniran Tella, Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, gave the warning in Ado-Ekiti at a stakeholders’ meeting with political leaders, religious groups, youths and women. The meeting was convened to address issues bothering on expanding voters’ access to polling units, as it affected the state. “The commission is challenging you to play this game by the rules,” Tella said. “The Electoral Act, 2010, Section 9991, as amended, frowns at organising election campaigns ahead of the stipulated time. “For the avoidance of doubt, that section of the law states that the period of campaigns in public by any political party shall commence 90 days before the voting day and end 24 hours before the day.” According to Tella, the continuous voter registration exercise will commence in Ekiti on June 28. Tella said that only those who had attained the age of eighteen were expected to participate in the registration.
