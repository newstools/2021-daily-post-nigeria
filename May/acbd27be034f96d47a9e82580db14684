Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has vowed that the efforts by the Nigerian Army to stop the agitation for Biafra Nation would remain unfruitful. According to him, the siege would not force the IPOB members to back down on the pursuit for actualization of Biafra. DAILY POST reports that the Nigerian Army and other security agencies have several times clashed with the IPOB members in South-East and South-South leading to death of scores. The Eastern Security Network, ESN, which was established by Nnamdi Kanu to curb the farmer and herdsmen crisis in the region have been accused of launching attacks on security operatives in the two regions. Recall that about seven suspected members of a militia group linked to IPOB were killed three weeks ago during a joint operation by the Nigeria Police Force, the Nigerian Army and Department of State Services. Among those killed was one suspected Commander Ikonso, identified as the Vice President-designate of IPOB. However, Nnamdi Kanu on his official Twitter handle on Sunday, warned that the siege must stop. According to him, “Let this be clear: This unwarranted siege of Biafraland must stop. Or we stop it. The siege won’t take us back down from restoring #Biafra. “It will rather strengthen our resolve & recruit more faithful to the cause. The more you siege, the closer Biafra beckons”.
