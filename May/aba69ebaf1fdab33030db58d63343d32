Governor Wike during a meeting with traditional rulers, political and opinion leaders of Ekpeye on Tuesday warned that his administration will not be dragged into any separation agenda. He warned those agitating to stay clear of his state, adding that he would leave no stone unturned in protecting Rivers State. “We will do everything we can to protect the interest of our State. “We are friendly people in this state and allow anyone to come here and do business. But nobody should go beyond doing business to hoist unnecessary flags here,” Wike warned. Responding to a post on Wike’s position on the matter , Onochie on her Twitter page, wrote: “Correct! Not an inch of the South-South will be annexed. “We are Nigerians. Nothing more.”
