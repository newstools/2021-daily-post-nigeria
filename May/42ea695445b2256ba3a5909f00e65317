Cristiano Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes has dismissed the player’s mother’s claim that the Juventus star will rejoin Sporting CP this summer. Ronaldo started his football career at Sporting before moving to Manchester United in 2003 where he developed into a big star and later left Old Trafford for Real Madrid. Ronaldo, 36, scored his 100th Juventus goal on Wednesday, but there are growing speculations that the Portugal captain could leave this summer after a difficult season with the Italian giants, who are at risk of not playing in the Champions League next season. Following Sporting claiming of their first Portuguese title since 2002, Ronaldo’s mother Dolores Aveiro declared she will try to convince the 5-time Ballon d’Or winner to return to his boyhood club. “I’ll talk to him [Cristiano] to bring him back’ Aveiro said. ‘Next year he will play in Alvalade [Sporting’s stadium],” she said. However, Mendes says a return Sporting is not on the cards for the superstar. “Cristiano is very proud of Sporting winning the championship, as he has demonstrated publicly, but at the moment, his career plans do not go through Portugal,” Mendes told Portuguese newspaper Record.
