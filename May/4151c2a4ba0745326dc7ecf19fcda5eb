Manchester United have decided to keep Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as their manager, despite a painful defeat to Villarreal in the Europa League final. The UK Telegraph reports that the executive vice-chairman of the club, Ed Woodward, will offer the Norwegian a new three-year deal. Solskjaer replaced Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford in December 2018 on a temporary basis. In March 2019, he was appointed on a full-time basis on a three-year contract, following a run of good results. With the 48-year-old having one year left on the current contract, United have decided to extend his stay, despite his failure to win any silverware during his time. Solskjaer’s men had the chance to break that duck but lost to Villarreal 11-10 on penalties in Gdansk. Europa League final: Villarreal made it hard for us – Man Utd coach, Solskjaer
