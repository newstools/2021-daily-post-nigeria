Real Madrid has confirmed that defender, Ferland Mendy, has been diagnosed with tibial periostitis ahead of the team’s away LaLiga clash with Granada on Thursday. Real Madrid made this known in a statement on their official website on Tuesday. The Los Blancos head to the game following a 2-2 with Sevilla last Sunday. Zinedine Zidane’s side is currently in the second position on the LaLiga table with 75 points from 35 games. The statement read, “After the tests carried out today on our player Ferland Mendy by the Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with tibial periostitis. Pending evolution.” This is coming less than three days after Real Madrid confirmed that their captain, Sergio Ramos, was diagnosed with tendinosis of the semimembranous muscle of his left leg.
