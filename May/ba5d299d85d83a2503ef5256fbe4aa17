The Zamfara State Government has confirmed the release of Alh. Bala Afuro Gusau, the father of a popular businessman in the state, Hon. Sanusi Bala Sarkin Dawaki Maituta. A statement from the state’s Commissioner for Information, Ibrahim Dosara, said Bala, who was abducted a month ago by his kidnappers, was released on Saturday. The commissioner explained that the victim was freed unharmed. He, however, revealed the state government did not pay ransom to facilitate his release even though the abductors initially demanded the sum of N50 million. “We are happy to announce that Alh. Bala Afuro Gusau who has been in captivity for over a month now, has been released. “We were able to secure his release and no ransom was paid even his abductors demanded a ransom,” he said. Recall that the State Police Command earlier secured the release of 11 kidnapped persons in the state. In a statement issued on April 11, the police spokesman in the state, Muhammad Shehu, noted that the 11 victims were released unconditionally after a group took them to a forest near Gobirawan Chali in Maru Local Government Area. He said the release of the kidnapped victims was part of the ongoing peace process enunciated by Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara.
