Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher, has backed the Reds to win the UEFA Champions League trophy next season. Recall that Chelsea won the Champions League this season. The Blues defeated Manchester City 1-0 in the final on May 29 in Porto. Kai Havertz scored the only goal of the match. But Carragher now believes that Liverpool, who were knocked out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid, will lift their seventh European Cup next year. “I fancy Liverpool next year [to win the Champions League],” Carragher told CBS Sports. “I have that feeling [they will win it].” Meanwhile, Liverpool finished in the third position on the Premier League table this season, behind Manchester City and Manchester United.
