Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has allayed the fears of Makurdi residents and environs over the aerial surveillance carried out by the military in parts of the state capital on Sunday. DAILY POST reports that the aerial surveillance created tension in Makurdi on Sunday as many feared criminal attack. However, Ortom while speaking at Petros Assembly International during a thanksgiving service and child dedication by the state commissioner for youth and sports, Pastor Ojotu Ojema, said the surveillance was targeted at flushing out criminal elements and bandits from their hideouts. He urged residents of Makurdi and neighbouring communities to cooperate with security agents, assuring that there was no cause for alarm. Governor Ortom who noted that he remains committed to ensuring justice, equity and fairness for all, thanked Benue people for their support to his administration. He acknowledged the commitment of Pastor Ojotu Ojema to his duties and passion for God, stressing that his becoming Commissioner was purely on merit. Pastor Ojotu Ojema recalled his past as someone who grew up in Obagaji where he attended primary and secondary schools and later moved to Makurdi and did a Diploma programme, sold fuel and became an Okada man but today by Godâ€™s providence through Governor Samuel Ortom, he is serving as Commissioner. The Commissioner said he had learnt a lot working with the Governor, noting that for the many things God had done for him and his family, he decided to return to Him in thanksgiving. Earlier, General Overseer Petros Assembly International, Archbishop Cephas Okwori charged leaders to emulate Jesus Christ in their service to the people, stressing that leadership does not imply superiority but service to the people.
