The World Igbo Peoples Assembly (WIPAS), a sociopolitical group, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to treat all Nigerians equally. The Igbo group also asked the President to engage agitators like a father to avoid the break up of the country in his hand and regime. WIPAS, in a statement by its Board of Trustees Chairman, Mazi Chuks Ibegbu, on Sunday, in Umuahia, said Buhari’s style of leadership and obvious nepotism was the root cause of insecurity in Nigeria. The group advised the President to change his ways and warned against the violent break up of Nigeria as the consequences will be devastating for West Africa due to the human tragedy and movement it will cause. The Igbo socio-political body asked Nigerians to sit down and agree whether to remain one or go their separate ways peacefully. WIPAS warned against the growing corruption and looting of Nigeria’s commonwealth by the political class. The group further attributed the insecurity in the country to the corrupt practices of most of the elected political office holders and security heads, accusing them of compromise in the war against criminalities. The Assembly called on patriotic citizens of the country to use the forthcoming 2023 general elections to vote out incompetent office holders, adding that they have failed systemically and subjected the entire nation to abject poverty, Starvation and insecurity.
