The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said it is not accountable to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). It said this in reaction to an invitation by the anti-graft agency after a member of the party, Kasim Afegbua, petitioned the EFCC. Sen. Walid Jubrin, Chairman, PDP Board of Trustees (BoT), said this while speaking with newsmen at the end of the board’s meeting in Abuja. He said the party is only accountable to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). “INEC is the regulatory organ for all political parties and the PDP is inclusive. “The PDP account has been audited by a reputable chattered firm and the report is with INEC and the body has not raised any objection,” he said. Jubrin insisted it is constitutionally wrong for EFCC to intervene in an issue that is purely that of political parties. Jubrin also reacted to the defection of Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State to the All Progressives Congress (APC). “This is annoying. Ayade is someone who has benefited for five years from PDP and he is talking of going to another party”, he said. Jubrin announced that the PDP would organise a mega rally in Calabar, the state capital, to show it was still in control of the state.
