Ali Ndume, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Army, has faulted the Southern Governors for banning open grazing in the southern states of Nigeria. Ndume, speaking during an interview on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Thursday, said he expected the governors to come out with an immediate solution instead of issuing a blanket statement. He noted that their action couldn’t be as effective as meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari to address the issues of concern. “I’m not concerned about what they (the governors) said … I was thinking that they would come out with an immediate solution, mid-term solution, and long-term solution to open grazing. “We’ve serious security challenges in this country that are different in all the geopolitical zones, and I was expecting that the governors will come together and address these issues, come up with the solutions that they have mentioned and discuss with the President in a closed-session as we call it in the Senate, not to come out to the media and issue a blanket statement,” Ndume said. Meanwhile, the Southern Governors Forum had on Tuesday urged the Federal Government to urgently convoke a national dialogue to address the widespread agitations in the nation. The 15 members in attendance also called for restructuring of the country, leading to the evolution of state police.
