Shehu Sani, former Kaduna lawmaker, has kicked against the bill seeking to scrap National Youth Service Corps, NYSC. A bill seeking to scrap the scheme, sponsored by Awaji Abiante, a lawmaker from Rivers State on Wednesday, passed through second reading at the green chamber. The lawmaker seeks to use the bill to amend section 315 (1)(a) of the 1999 constitution. Abiante, giving various reasons the NYSC should be scrapped, said the scheme has failed to address the essence of its establishment. There have also been agitations from Nigerians seeking to scrap NYSC due to insecurity across the country. However, Sani on his Twitter page said the scheme is needed now more than ever for Nigerians to know other regions aside from their birth place. According to him, NYSC should not be scrapped but expanded to give military training. His tweet read: “The NYSC should not be scrapped.Its needed now more than ever before.Many Nigerians have never known anywhere other than their hometown and University town if not for NYSC. “Its mandate should be expanded to give participants full military training in the face of insecurity.” NYSC refutes report of directing corps members not to wear uniform
