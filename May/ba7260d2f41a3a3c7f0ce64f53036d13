The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Edo State has said it is constrained to react to the undemocratic, unconstitutional, unacceptable and regrettable behaviour of some of its members yesterday. The party said being an organized and democratic entity, governed by a constitution and all its are expected to get a copy and acquaint themselves of the content. The Edo State PDP publicity secretary, Chris Osa Nehikhare said the party views very seriously the issues of suspensions of its members and elected officials. He said the method of removing party leaders, officials and members was clearly spelt out in the constitution. “The events that purportedly occurred in Egor Local government on Tuesday, 18 May 2021 whereby a group of people, without the backing of the constitution and therefore unknown to the party constitution, reportedly broke in and took over the Secretariat, and suspended or removed the Egor Local Government party Chairman and the party Secretary, is null and void. Chief Manfred Ekundayo Idehen and Mr. Moses Godwin Osarunmwense remain the Chairman and Secretary respectively. Edo PDP is a peaceful, united and vibrant political party where dialogue is our watchword. We encourage political engagements and contestations which must be guided by the tenets of our constitution. We, however, frowned at political indiscipline that brings disrepute to our brand. He noted that as a party in government members must live and operate by example. And be seen to follow due process, abide by the rule of law and always be conscious of the message they share in the public domain especially the voting population at all times.
