The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has commenced direct distribution of relief materials to 24, 925 households of displaced persons affected by banditry in Niger State. The 14 beneficiary Local Government Areas include Rafi, Shiroro, Bosso, Munya, Paikoro, Mariga, Kontagora, Magama, Mashegu, Wushishi, Rijau, Borgu, Lapai and Lavun. The Director-General, AVM Muhammadu Muhammed (rtd.) flagged off the intervention in Kuta, the headquarters of Shiroro LGA. Muhammed was represented by the Head of Minna Operations Office, Hajiya Zainab Ahmad Saidu. The DG sympathised with the affected persons and said the relief materials were approved by President Muhammadu Buhari. The items were delivered to complement the efforts of the Niger State Government and other donors. The donation comprised 5,412 bags (10kg) of rice, 5,412 bags (10kg) of beans, 500 kegs of vegetable oil, 500 cartons of seasoning cubes and 500 bags of iodized salt. These would be shared to affected persons in the IDP camps and host communities by NEMA in collaboration with officials of the State Emergency Management Agency. Bandits have, since 2020, targeted several communities, killing and kidnapping at will. In February, the criminals abducted staff members and students of Government Science College, Kagara. The captives were released about 10 days later after an unspecified ransom was reportedly paid. NEMA warns about imminent flooding in Rivers communities
