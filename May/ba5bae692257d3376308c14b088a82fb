Barcelona will prioritise a move for Erling Haaland over re-signing Lionel Messi this summer, the UK Sun reports. The Spanish giants are in a tight financial situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Barca may not be able to afford the transfer Borussia Dortmund will demand for Haaland and a new contract for Messi. Should they be forced to choose one, Barca are leaning towards Haaland. Haaland is 13 years younger than Messi and is currently the hottest property in European football. The Norway striker is also wanted by Real Madrid, Manchester City and Chelsea.
