Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand has noted that Liverpool ace, Mohamed Salah is not getting the respect he deserves in the Premier League. Salah has been a constant source of goals for Liverpool for about three seasons now. He is battling Tottenham striker, Harry Kane for the Golden Boot this season, with both attackers on 22 goals with just two games left. And United legend Ferdinand is of the opinion that the lack of credit Salah has received is “out of order”. “He’s vying for top goalscorer again in this league and he’s not in people’s team of the season, I do not get it,” Ferdinand told Vibe With FIVE. “He ain’t getting the respect he deserves. Mohamed Salah is a top, top, top, top player who is churning out numbers year in, year out. “It’s become the norm to see him at the top of the charts now. It’s out of order!” The Egyptian attacker is expected to lead the Liverpool frontline when Jurgen Klopp’s side tackle Burnley and Crystal Palace in their last two games of the season, with the hope of reaching top four still very bright.
