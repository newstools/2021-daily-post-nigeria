Valentine Ozigbo, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship hopeful is optimistic about the bright chance of the party in the November election. Noting that other parties stand no chance in the contest, Ozigbo advised the party to zone the ticket to the Southern senatorial district. Ozigbo, 50, from Amesi in Aguata Local Government, told reporters that such decision would further boost the electoral fortunes of the PDP. “All I know is that the next governor of this state will be from the South. Anyone that is not from the zone that is in the race may be doing so for another reason”, he said. Ozigbo noted that some people are contesting election to make money or for other reasons that are best known to them. “If someone outside the 12 of us from the zone wins the PDP primary election, what it simply means is that PDP is not in the race.” The business leader expressed confidence that the party would apply wisdom and confirmed the relationship between all aspirants was cordial. He observed that the PDP is more responsible, more democratic and had provided a level playing field in the race. “The losers will support one another provided the person is from the South. No formal declaration on zoning yet but we believe the right thing will be done.” On the security situation in the South-East, Ozigbo said all hands must be on deck to fix challenge. “Things must not escalate, poor leadership creating problems. Leaders must take full responsibility. Governance is not rocket science. It’s about engaging the right hands. “I have the best chance anyone can imagine. I’m not a newcomer to the PDP. In 2018, I formally registered in my ward. “Anambra people will be my regulator. I have better experience than other aspirants. We will be accountable”, Ozigbo promised.
