The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Kaduna State University Chapter, has directed its members to join the ongoing warning strike by public sector workers in Kaduna State. Dr Peter Adamu, ASUU Chairperson, gave the order in a circular to members of the union, on Monday. Adamu urged members to remember that ASUU is an affiliate of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and ASUU principal officers were part of the NLC National Executive Council that took the decision on the strike action. “Also, members that violate the strike action must note that the union will not be there for them when the wrath of the governor falls on them,” he said. He added that ASUU must unite for a just cause because injury to one is injury to all. Recall that the NLC National President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, had said the five-day strike action would run its full course unless the state government attended to the workers grievances.
