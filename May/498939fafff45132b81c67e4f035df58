Following the foiled attack on the facilities in the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Sunday night, which affected only vehicles, an advocacy group for promotion of peace and good governance in Enugu State, Enugu Youth Coalition for Good Governance, has fingered desperate politicians in the state who have dominant interest in the state’s governorship position in 2023, and are unhappy with the existing peace and security in Enugu, to be behind the unfortunate incident. Reacting to the development, the Enugu youth coalition, through a statement signed by its coordinator and secretary, Hon. Ikechukwu Ibeh and Engr. Jude Onyema respectively, disclosed that these political elements had approached their members with fictitious and trumped up allegations, requesting them to deploy their social media platforms to cast aspersions against the people-oriented and peace loving administration of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, in order to achieve their selfish political interest. The youth advocacy group added that their members outrightly rejected the offer presented to them by the politicians because of their conviction that the plot was immoral, mischievous and baseless as none of the allegations raised against the government was true. The group stated that “this foiled attack on INEC office in Enugu, is one of the heinous plots of these wicked politicians, hovering from one part of the state to another, to fiercely create an unpopular, strange and false impression that the most peaceful and secure state in Nigeria (Enugu) is in crisis”. While condemning the foiled attack on INEC, the group charged the security agencies to fish out those behind the heinous act and bring them to book, stressing that “Enugu State is safe, secure and progressive, and no amount of blackmail or needless distraction from those who have abandoned their constitutional responsibilities to pursue selfish political ambition ahead of 2023, will change this obvious fact”. “We therefore advise the public to be wary of the antics of these mischievous elements. We wish to also advise these desperate politicians, whose ulterior motive is targeted at 2023 general elections, to have a rethink and channel their energy and resources to useful engagements that would add value to the development of Enugu State”, the statement said.
