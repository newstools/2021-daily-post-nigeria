Governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), have insisted that there would be no zoning ahead of the 2023 general elections and anyone is free to contest for any position. They made this known in a statement signed by their chairman and Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, on Friday. “APC belongs to all Nigerians. Everyone, from every part of the country, is free to aspire for any position in the party in line with provisions of our party’s constitution and the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended. “The guiding philosophy as enshrined in the provisions of our manifesto is economic, social, and political development of Nigeria,” the governors declared. They added: “Our party, APC, is open, transparent, and will continue to guarantee fair contestation in politics, in line with the overarching commitment of President Muhammadu Buhari and all our founding leaders.” 2023: Zoning won’t decide Enugu governor – APC chairman, Nwoye cautions campaigners
