The Ohanaeze Ndigbo has urged the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to rescind its decision on the fresh security measures it rolled out to curtail insecurity in the Southeast and South-South part of the country. DAILY POST reports that the government had announced plans for fresh measures after a security council meeting at the Aso Villa, Abuja. But the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization believes such would fuel disintegration. In a statement by the Secretary-General of the organization, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, Ohanaeze called for a national dialogue. He said President Buhari should rescind the decision for new military
“offensive in the old Eastern Nigeria, as it’s a trap by enemies of the President to push Nigeria into disintegration.” The Igbo group said, “They’re twisting the hands of President Buhari not to engage southeast leaders, especially the youths through dialogue and empowerment programmes. “Militarization of Southeast and South South will reopen the wounds of 1967/70, which Igbos had forgotten. Turning Southeast into the epicentre of violence and theatre of warfare is an ill wind that will blow nobody any good. “We are using this medium to extend President Buhari a helping hand by seeking for dialogue than shoot at sight order. “We call for change of plans and tactics in handling Southeast security situations. The Presidency should dialogue now with Southeast youths through the leaders and Governors to avert the disintegration of Nigeria.”
