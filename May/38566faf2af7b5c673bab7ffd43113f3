Governor Malam Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has sacked all nurses below level 14 under the State government. This is coming amid the ongoing strike and protest in the State by the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, with the aim of making the Governor rescind the recent mass sack of workers. DAILY POST had reported the rally organized by the NLC as part of the ongoing five-day warning strike in Kaduna which was later hijacked by thugs suspected to be working for the state government. The dismissal was contained in a statement issued by the governor’s Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Muyiwa Adekeye. Recall that the Governor had reportedly accused some health workers of working with the NLC to shut down some hospitals. The statement reads, “Apart from referring the nurses involved to the Ministry of Justice to initiate prosecution, the government also announced the dismissal of all nurses below Grade Level 14 for the illegal strike.” “The Ministry of Health has been directed to advertise vacancies for the immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed. “The government has directed all its Ministries, Departments and Agencies to submit their attendance registers to the Head of Service while Kaduna State University should submit same to the Secretary to the State Government and the Commissioner of Education.” KDSG will not tolerate criminal acts disguised as industrial action
