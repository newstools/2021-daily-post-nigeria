A Premier League side will win the 2020/2021 Champions League. The real question then becomes will it be Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea or Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City? For Tuchel, he failed at this very point last year. The German led Paris Saint-Germain to the final, where they lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich. The Ligue 1 side dominated Bayern Munich, but Hansi Flick’s men proved to be super efficient in the game. This is Tuchel’s quick chance at redemption. He replaced Frank Lampard in January and has taken a short time to instill his methods into the Blues’ squad. If he defeats City for the third time this season, Tuchel will become the third successive German coach to win the Champions League, after Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp and Flick. On the other side, there is Pep Guardiola. The Spaniard that’s a slave to tactics and systems. His pride is at stake. A lot of critics have insisted that Guardiola cannot win Europe’s top club competition without Lionel Messi. They have been proven for so long, with the 50-year-old failing to lift the trophy during his spell at Bayern. Also, Guardiola would really loath to lose for the third straight time to Tuchel within six months. The Premier League champions finished the domestic season with a resounding 5-0 win over Everton, while Chelsea lost 2-1 at Aston Villa, narrowly qualifying for next season’s Champions League. One would expect Guardiola to pull this off. He has never lost a final and a win in Porto will be the culmination of ‘Project City’. He was hired for exactly this purpose.
