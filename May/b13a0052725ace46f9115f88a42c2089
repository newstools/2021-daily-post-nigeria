Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, was an unused substitute as his team beat Bologna 4-1 to qualify for the Champions League. Andrea Pirlo’s men scraped into fourth place on the final day of the Serie A season without their star player. Sky Sport Italia claimed Ronaldo was “too tired” to play in the match. However, his teammates got the job done, with Napoli drawing 1-1 at home to Hellas Verona. Federico Chiesa and Adrien Rabiot struck, adding to an Alvaro Morata brace as Juve went 4-0 up. Ronaldo stayed on the bench throughout the match alongside the likes of Aaran Ramsey and Gianluigi Buffon, despite Pirlo being able to use five substitutes, with the veteran remaining on the sidelines.
