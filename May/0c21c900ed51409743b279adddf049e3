Popular Nollywood movie producer, Tchidi Chikere, and his wife Nuella Njubigbo have reportedly ended their marriage of 6 years. There have been reports making the rounds on the internet that the couple who walked down the aisle in 2014 were having marital crisis. It was also observed that they’ve unfollowed each other on Instagram. Following the development, the duo in a video posted via their Instagram accounts debunked claims of their marriage crashing. However weeks after they debunked the claim in a video they shared, Nuella has now removed Tchidi’s surname “Chikere” from her Instagram bio. Her Instagram bio which also read “mother and wife” before now, has now been changed to “Award winning filmmaker, mum, CEO”. Also, Chikere took to his Instagram account to share a cryptic post amid rumors that their marriage had crashed. “Pain will leave you once it’s done teaching you. His grace has brought me this far, He is still with me,” he wrote. See pictures below… Alleged defilement: Iyabo Ojo vows to rearrest Baba Ijesha if released
