The bandits’ attack which took place at a mosque in Jibiya Katsina State in the early hours of Monday could have been averted if the criminals did not play a fast one on the residents. The bandits who were reported to have stormed the mosque located at the outskirt of Jibiya town were said to be numbered over 100. A credible source from the community told DAILY POST that residents of the community already had intelligence on the looming attack but were outsmarted by the bandits. Our source said the residents were informed the attack would take place at midnight causing the youths and vigilante men of the community to lay ambush waiting for the bandits to arrive. Unfortunately, the notorious bandits gained access into the community through an entirely different route without the vigilantes and the youth suspecting. “We were expecting them from the eastern entry point through Daddara, Kukar Babangida or Magama but this time they proceeded beyond the town and camped at Jibawa. “From Jibawa they went round to the western entry point near Yunusa Dantauri Hospital and attacked a mosque on the outskirt of the town,” a source said. Katsina residents in this month of Ramadan like never before have suffered countless attacks at the hands of the dare-devil bandits. Bandits attack Katisna Mosque, abduct 40 worshippers
