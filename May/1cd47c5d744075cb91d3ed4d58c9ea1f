Arsenal owner, Stan Kroenke, is planning to back manager Mikel Arteta seriously in the summer market. The American billionaire will not sack the under-fire Spaniard despite the Gunners’ disastrous season. Instead, Kroenke will sanction a free-spending summer transfer window, according to the UK Sun. Arsenal crashed out of the Europa League at the semi-final stage to Villarreal. Arteta’s men are now unlikely to qualify for any European football next season, as they currently sit in ninth place in the Premier League. Fans have begun calling for the coach’s head, but Kroenke doesn’t agree, and is convinced that the former midfielder is the right man to lead the club forward. It is claimed that at least two or three big-name players will arrive at the Emirates this summer, as Kroenke looks to improve Arteta’s squad ahead of the 2021/2022 season.
