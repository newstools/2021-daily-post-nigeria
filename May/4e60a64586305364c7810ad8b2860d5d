Some Yoruba nation agitators have stormed Idiroko in Ogun State and forcefully opened its land border. DAILY POST reports that Idiroko is a border town between Nigeria and the Republic of Benin. The land border has remained closed since 2019 when the Federal Government directed that all importations be done through the seaports. But, the Yoruba nation supporters invaded the border community on Saturday and forced open all the gates at the international frontier. A video on social media showed a gun being snatched from an Immigration officer. A man in a yellow T-shirt was also seen shooting the gun into the air to the admiration of others at the scene. Different voices were heard in the video calling on the soldiers and other security agents to come out and shoot. A young man, who was accused of trying to record the incident with his mobile phone was attacked and beaten to stupor. When contacted, the spokesman of the Nigeria Customs Service Ogun 1 Area Command, Hammed Oloyede, said the situation was under control. ”There was no attack on our patrol bases or checkpoints. Those guys are just doing their own. They tried to attack one patrol point but it was repelled. The situation is under control. There is no problem.” Meanwhile, the spokesman to Sunday Adeyemo Igboho in a video commended the actions of the agitators, saying the Federal Government shut down Yoruba States borders while those in the north were open.
