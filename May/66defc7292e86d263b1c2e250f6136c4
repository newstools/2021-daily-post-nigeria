Fighters of the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) are sustaining their assault against the Abubakar Shekau-led Boko Haram. Shekau, leader of the Jama’tu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad (JAS) faction, was eliminated last week in Sambisa forest. Nigeria’s intelligence service confirmed he blew himself as ISWAP attempted to take him. The ISIS affiliate, has killed and arrested some Boko Haram commanders and members. The sect captured Shekau’s commanders like faction including Mustapha Krimima Jaysh, Ba’akaka, Malkin Tijjani, Hirasama and Mallam Ballu who refused to surrender. According to PRNigeria, gun trucks of terrorists were sighted at Marte, East of Tumour, Tumbumma and Tumbuktu Triangle in Sambisa, after the battle of supremacy between ISWAP and Boko Haram at Garin Malam. Series of meetings are being held in Sabeel Huda camp in the heart of Sambisa forest between ISWAP commanders and other surrendered senior Boko Haram members. The fate of the arrested opposing fighters would be decided by Albarnawy’s disciplinary Committee, headed by one Muhammad Malumma, ISWAP’s Chief Judge. The leadership has vowed to eliminate all terrorists belonging to the Shekau group, if they fail to bow. An intelligence operative said an intercepted communication between ISWAP leaders indicated that a committee led by Abu-Mosad Albarnawy, a self-proclaimed appointee of Amirul Mu’uminoon, (ISIS Caliphate Leader) had dissolved all Shekau’s structures. The ongoing war is being coordinated by the Wali of ISWAP, Muhammad Dawud, aka Abu Hafsat, and four other ISWAP Fiye (Service Chiefs), and Khalids, (Commanding Officers) from Lake Chad, Tumbuktu and Marte. The ISWAP Service Chiefs and its Commanding Officers are all under the supervision of Abu-Mosad Albarnawy. Shekau: Borno residents, others doubt claims Boko Haram leader was killed, demand proofs
