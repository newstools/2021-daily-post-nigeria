Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has handed a list of three players to the club to sign. Scholes wants Man United to make a move for Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish, Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho and Paris Saint-Germain’s Marquinhos this summer transfer window. According to him, Grealish, Sancho and Marquinhos are exactly the types of players Man United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer needs at Old Trafford to compete for the Premier League title next season. “I think we need someone who is a creative midfield player. Grealish or Sancho, one of them would be ideal,” Scholes told the Webby & O’Neill show. “It would be great to have a left-footed centre back, but I don’t think it’s needed, I don’t think we are desperate for that. “I would like to see a centre-half come in next to Maguire. I think Lindelof is doing alright, I just think alright isn’t good enough to win a league. “Marquinhos from PSG, I think he’ll be a brilliant centre-half next to Maguire, but again you are talking about a lot of money.” EPL: Scholes berates Solskjaer’s joy after team’s 0-0 draw with Leeds
