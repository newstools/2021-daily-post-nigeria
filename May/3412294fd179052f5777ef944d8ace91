President of the Italian football federation (FIGC), Gabriele Gravina, has said Juventus face being kicked out of Serie A if they don’t withdraw from the European Super League. AC Milan and Inter Milan have backed out of the breakaway competition, leaving Juventus as the only Italian club persisting with the plans. “The rules are clear. If Juventus is still part of the Super League when it enters next season, it can’t participate in Serie A. “I would be sorry for the fans but rules are rules and they apply to everyone. I hope this holdout ends soon,” Gravina told Naples radio station Kiss Kiss. Juventus won Serie A for the ninth straight year last season, but have since relinquished the title to Inter.
