The Catholic Bishop of Minna Diocese, Most Revd. Martin Uzoukwu, has enjoined politicians and media practitioners in Nigeria to stand on the path of truth to salvage the country. Uzoukwu, who made the call on Sunday as part of activities to mark the 55th World Communication Day at the St. Michael Catholic Cathedral Church, Minna, stated that whatever they do, they will be accountable to God. The cleric speaking on this year’s theme “Come and see” at a Media lunch/interactive session with Journalists in Niger state stated that the country is passing through difficult times and it’s only by standing for the truth that it can survive. “We encourage our politicians to always speak the truth. What the country is going through now will soon come to an end. Nigerians must speak the truth because it is only the truth that can salvage the situation we have found ourselves in this country”. “I want the media to adhere to the tenets of the profession by standing on the side of truth. You must shelve the bad and ugly side even though the truth is bitter. Say the right thing and speak to your conscience,” according to him. Earlier, the Diocesan Communications Director, Revd. Fr. Jude Offor said the media has what it takes to save the country insisting that whatever it says can either make or mar the society. Offor then called on the media to use all forms of medium to reach people particularly the less-privileged and physically challenged persons just as they are and where they live in the Society.
