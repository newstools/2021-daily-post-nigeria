The Paramount ruler of Ayama Ekede Town in Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers State, His Royal Highness, Bibama Ekpi-Ri-Kpo has remained in captivity five days after his abduction by unknown gunmen. The 92-year-old Traditional Ruler was said to have been kidnapped on Monday from his palace. DAILY POST gathered that the kidnappers were yet to establish contact with the family of the monarch at the time of filing this report. The development appears to be unsettling the family who have expressed fears over the health of their father who they said is living with a medical condition. Prince Jonathan Ekpirikpo, the son of the paramount ruler in an interview said “we are still looking for how to get information on his whereabouts. As at the time they kidnapped the man, he wasn’t feeling fine. Our appeal is that they should leave the man or they should inform us of his whereabouts, he is an elderly man”. “We have made an entry at the police division in Andoni and they told us they will transfer the case to Port Harcourt.” In a separate incident, three suspected members of rival cult groups were killed during a clash in Ajakajak community in Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers State. A source disclosed that the shooting started when members of a rival cult group invaded the community and engaged in a shoot out, another group whose members were resident in the community.
