Senator representing Lagos Central and former First Lady of Lagos State, Remi Tinubu has said she fights her own battle and does not report anyone to her husband, Bola Tinubu. Speaking during an interview on TVC, Remi said she fights her own battles when she knows she is right without telling her husband. Remi claimed she keeps some battles away from her husband because he will sometimes tell her she is wrong or try to convince her not to do certain things. “That I have a position doesn’t mean l have to lose myself to that position, because the position will go and then, who do I go back to? “Most of the time when people see me talk strongly they think it’s because I am Asiwaju’s wife but Asiwaju is somebody that I don’t go home to report anyone to because he would tell me, that I am wrong. “I don’t know why but when you have a husband who tells you, ‘you are wrong when you are right, in your own view, I don’t think you will keep going to him for anything. “So, I do my own fight when I have to, especially in what I believe in,” she said.
