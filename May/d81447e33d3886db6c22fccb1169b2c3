Former National Publicity Secretary of the defunct New People’s Democratic Party (nPDP), Chief Chukwuemeka Eze, has said maladministration by Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State is responsible for the mass defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Eze said this while reacting to the defection of Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State from the PDP to the All Progressive Congress (APC). He posited that Ayade has always displayed the carriage and common traits of a good progressive and expressed confidence that his entrance will place his people on a better pedestal and add weight to the cause of a better Nigeria in 2023. He lauded the Cross River Governor for making the bold step to align with the progressives and described APC as a party of infrastructure and projects. The APC chieftain, in a statement made available to DAILY POST, said the determination of Rivers people to sever the state from the bonds of the PDP scavengers, after two terms of maladministration which has left citizens to wallow in poverty and deep want, appears to be gathering momentum more than ever. He expressed delight that the elites and people of goodwill across party lines were beginning to appreciate the need to honor the power sharing formula canvassed by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, which acknowledged and gave maximum regard to the multi-ethnic nature of Rivers State, and as well accommodates all interests and opinions in the collective interest of the citizens. The former nPDP National spokesman commended the defectors and further stated that Governor Wike and the PDP will always be remembered for the rains of abuses and array of unfulfilled promises it continually made to the people. Some former Commissioners, ex-Special Assistants, State Party Executive Committee Members, past Council Chairmen, erstwhile LGA party leaders were recently received into the All Progressives Congress last Sunday, in what many have described as a mega defection rally at the APC State Secretariat in Port Harcourt, the state capital.
