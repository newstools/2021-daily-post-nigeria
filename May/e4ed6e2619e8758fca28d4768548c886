The Police Command in Abia has confirmed that hoodlums numbering at least 100, attacked Bende Station in Abia, leaving two operatives with gunshot wounds. DAILY POST reported that the hoodlums set the station on fire at about 11pm on Wednesday. A source who spoke to newsmen said they heard sounds of gunshot around 10.45pm and when they rushed outside, saw the station on fire. “At that point, it dawned on us that the station was under attack so everybody began to scamper for safety,” the source said. Confirming the incident, the Spokesman of the state command, SP Godfrey Ogbonna, said two officers were shot in the leg by the attackers. Ogbonna said the attackers also burnt down the generator house and a multi-purpose building, belonging to Bende Local Government. He said the hoodlums later released criminal suspects, who were detained at the station. “They also burnt two vehicles, including the Divisional Police Officer’s Highlander Jeep and three motorcycles, parked at the station. “We do not know yet how they all gathered to execute the attack at the station. “Maybe they parked their vehicles away from their target and walked through footpaths to the place,” he said. He said the command had embarked on full investigations into the incident and other recent gunmen attacks in different parts of the state. Unknown gunmen attack Ebonyi community, kill 4, raze houses
