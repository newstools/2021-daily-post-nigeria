The press centre of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Taraba State council, was on Tuesday filled to capacity as members of the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) embarked on a prayer session for the country. Also observed to support NAWOJ to seek God’s intervention in the present security situation in the country are members of the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS), Federation of Muslim Women, among others. Led by the state chairperson of NAWOJ, Hilda Adebayo, the female journalists and their counterparts from other organizations said the only way out of the present security dungeon is “prayers”. The women complained that women were mostly at the receiving end of the crisis while school children can no longer go to school for fear of being kidnapped by hoodlums whom they said have continued to have a field day. Not comfortable with the situation that has begun to hamper farming activities across the nooks and crannies of the country, the women said they are holding unto God to nip the predicament from the bud. Stressing that women were determined to herald the presence of God to the problems bedevilling the country, Hilda Adebayo said the “only way forward for our country is prayer” hence the need for women irrespective of their religion, tribe and political differences, to come together to pray for the stability of our great nation” Hilda who said she has a dream that Nigeria despite the ongoing vices would turn out to be a great country urged women across the country not to relent in their efforts to God’s intervention. Women from the other sister associations also vowed not to be discouraged in their quests to engage relevant stakeholders while chasing after peace and coexistence of the nation.
