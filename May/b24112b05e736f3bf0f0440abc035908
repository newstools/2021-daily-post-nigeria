Manchester United is preparing to make a £40 million offer for Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane this summer, the UK Mirror reports. United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has told the club’s senior officials that he wants Varane next season to partner captain Harry Maguire. Varane has spent the last decade at Madrid, but is understood to have told them he wants a new challenge. The 28-year-old has one year left on his current contract and United are confident they can take advantage of that. United have tried to sign the Frenchman a few times in the past, but are hopeful they can be a third time lucky this summer. Solskjaer has admitted United need two or three world-class signings this summer to challenge for the title, with a central defender a priority. Transfer: Raphael Varane’s preferred move revealed
