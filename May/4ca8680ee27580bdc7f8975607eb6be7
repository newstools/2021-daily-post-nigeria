President Muhammadu Buhari has said happenings in Libya have implications for Nigeria and other countries in the Lake Chad Basin. He said this when he hosted Mohammed Younis Menfi, Chairman, Presidential Council of Libya, on Wednesday. Buhari noted that the Republics of Chad and Niger have extensive borders with Libya. “Whatever affects them affects us. The stability or instability of Libya will directly affect us”, he said. Buhari said Nigeria’s security is his top priority, noting that “unless a country or institution is secured, there’s no way you can efficiently manage it.” He thanked Menfi for personally attending the Summit of Lake Chad Basin Commission held in Abuja on Tuesday. Menfi, in his remarks, stated that Libya was fast evolving with an active government. “We are expelling the mercenaries, and unifying the instructions”, the chairman said. Menfi disclosed democratic elections would be held in due course, and assured of continued relationship between his country and Nigeria. “We aspire for joint cooperation, and reactivation of previous agreements,” he added.
