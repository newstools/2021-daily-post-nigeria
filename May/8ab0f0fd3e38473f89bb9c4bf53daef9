Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has admitted he has a major injury concern over captain Harry Maguire, following their 3-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday. Maguire, who had played every minute for United in the Premier League this season, was forced off during the second half at Villa Park. The England defender injured his ankle and tried to play following a first aid treatment before he eventually walked off. The incident has given Solskjaer plenty of concern ahead of the team’s upcoming fixture pile-up, which culminates in the Europa League final against Villarreal. Asked about the damage after the game, a worried Solskjaer admitted: “Might be a few weeks, might be a few days.”
