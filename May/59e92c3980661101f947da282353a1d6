Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has frowned at the inadequate budgetary provision for security agencies in Nigeria. The Governor said most budgetary allocations are made for things that do not matter, accusing the Federal Government of not taking security issues seriously. Governor Wike made the observation on Wednesday when he received the acting Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Port Harcourt, the state capital. “I laugh when I see the way the police are not being equipped. When I see the budget I asked, are we really serious as a country? “We budget on things that do not matter, I was a minister so I know and it is terrible. It means we are not taking security very seriously,” he said. “Security is not only the buying of guns, training is very important, intelligence is key. You can even spend more in gathering intelligence than even buying ammunition”. The Governor further stressed the need to support security agencies in the countries to enable them perform optimally. He also disclosed that his administration has concluded plans to handover some security equipment, including gunboats and vehicles, that will aid the job of the Rivers State Police Command easier.
