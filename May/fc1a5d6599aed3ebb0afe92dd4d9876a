Juventus goalkeeper, Gianluigi Buffon, has finally confirmed that he would leave the club at the end of the season. Buffon, 43, made the announcement to beIN Sports. According to him, Juventus lacked continuity this season. The Italian shot-stopper returned to Turin in July 2019 after one year with Paris Saint-Germain, but his contract expires in June and he feels it’s time to part ways with the Bianconeri. “I’ve decided to leave Juventus at the end of the season, I’m not extending the contract,” Buffon said. “We lacked continuity,” he added. “In the end, in the games, we played against the top five, six teams, we often won. We drew sometimes and lost some. “But it has always been even games. Instead, we lost stupid points against the lesser teams. This means you are a team that has yet to grow in character.” Buffon kept three clean sheets in seven Serie A games this season for Juventus. He also helped Andrea Pirlo’s side to the Coppa Italia final, which seems set to be his last match with the club on May 19. Juventus fight for a place in the Champions League next season, as they sit fifth in the Serie A table, one point behind Napoli at fourth.
