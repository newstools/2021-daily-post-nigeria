He said the ongoing constitution review was a plot to stop agitation for Yoruba nation would not work. “The Yoruba are tired of this failed federation and we have graduated from restructuring to seeking self determination. “Those clamouring for restructuring have their eyes in 2023 elections and their agenda is at variance with the present demand. “For us as a race, it is a new dawn and we are determined to go all the way to get what we want legitimately and without creating unnecessary tension. “As a Yoruba son or daughter, it does not matter whether you are a Muslim, Christian or traditionalist, it behooves on you to work with others for the progress of our race”, Adams added.
