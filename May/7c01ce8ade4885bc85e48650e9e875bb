Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has insisted he has to ‘eliminate’ Andreas Christensen from his first-team squad when Mateo Kovacic finally returns from injury. Tuchel disclosed this during his pre-match press conference on Monday ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash with Leicester City on Tuesday night at Stamford Bridge. Recall that Kovacic limped out of Chelsea’s final training session before their Champions League quarter-final second leg tie against FC Porto last month. The Croatian international has also missed Chelsea’s last ten matches with a muscle injury as a result. “Kova [Mateo Kovacic] wasn’t in the squad [against Leicester City], and when he comes back, maybe I have to eliminate Andreas Christensen because of the number of players,” Tuchel said. Chelsea head to the Leicester City game after a 1-0 FA Cup final defeat against the Foxes on Saturday. The Blues currently sit in the fourth position on the Premier League table with 64 points from 36 games. Man City vs Chelsea: Tuchel gives injury updates ahead of FA Cup semi-final
