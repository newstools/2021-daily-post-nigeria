The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested Amos Olugbenga Olaniyan for allegedly defrauding people of more than N128,000,000 in a fraudulent investment scheme. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren in a statement said Olaniyan was nabbed following series of complaints. The petitioners alleged that Olaniyan, through his company, DHIL Nigeria Limited, popularly known as Crime Alert Security Network Investment, offered a monthly 30% returns on investment. The citizens said they were persuaded after listening to the suspect’s weekly radio programme.  After committing funds, they neither received the promised interest nor got a refund of their capital since 2020. In the course of investigations, the EFCC discovered that the suspect operated a classic Ponzi scheme and had defrauded hundreds of people. “Petitions are still pouring into the Commission daily from his alleged victims”, Uwujaren disclosed. It was discovered that DHIL Nigeria Limited was not registered with the Central Bank of Nigeria as a financial institution. Five exotic cars, three landed properties and other incriminating documents were recovered from Olaniyan. The suspect will be charged to court at the completion of investigations.
