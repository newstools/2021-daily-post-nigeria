The President of the United States of America, Joe Biden has commended the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Biden made this known in a statement released by the White House in Washington, while reacting to Israel and Hamas agreement on a ceasefire proposal by Egypt which is to take effect early Friday in Gaza. The President, however, emphasised that the U.S. will continue to support Israel militarily. “The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks by Hamas and other Gaza-based terrorist groups that have taken the lives of innocent civilians. “These hostilities have resulted in tragic deaths of so many civilians, including children, and I send my sincere condolences to all the families, Israeli and Palestinian, who have lost loved ones,” he said. The U.S. leader further thanked the Egyptians for their role in brokering the agreement. He also assured that the U.S. would work with the UN and other international organizations to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. “I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and to enjoy equal measures of freedom and democracy,’’ he added.
