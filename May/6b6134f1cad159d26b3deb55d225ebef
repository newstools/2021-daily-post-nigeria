The Biafra Nations League, BNL, has alleged that most attacks in the Eastern Region especially in Akwa Ibom, Rivers States are politically-motivated. The group said that some cultists who are being sponsored by politicians are hiding under ‘unknown gunmen’ to perpetrate evil. BNL said this while refuting reports linking unknown gunmen with Biafra agitation. In a statement on Wednesday by its Deputy National Leader and Head of Operations, BBs Media Ebuta A.Takon, the group said it has come up with the conclusion that some of the attacks especially in Rivers State, Akwa Ibom and some South East towns are carried out by sponsored cultists who are being used by aggrieved Politicians. The group dissociated its members from the recent attack on Police facility in Etim Ekpo in Akwa Ibom, adding that they are not part of the activities of unknown gunmen. Takon warned Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike against creating confusion in the State by accusing Biafra secessionist groups of infiltrating the State and killing police officers. BNL accused the Governor of making inciting comments and reminded him that Rivers State has been a violent state since its creation. “People in that state can kill themselves over politics, everyone knows that Rivers State is the center of political violence in South south and number 2 in Nigeria after Kano. “Wike knows that but he is only using blame game tactics like he did over the crisis in Oyigbo during a nationwide EndSars protest in other to exempt his State from Biafra agitation. BNL, however, said it will not condemn the attacks on police officers “because of the crimes, atrocities and evil that the Nigeria Police have committed in the past.” The group said they would have condemned the violent activities of the unknown gunmen if they had killed innocent individuals who are not officers of the Nigerian security.
