The trend of having tattoos of celebrities on bodies by fans seems to have not faded away. Recall that in the past few months fans of Bobrisky, Naira Marley amongst others drew tattoos of their favourite celebrities in show of their love for them. A fan recently took to social media displaying a tattoo of Tiwa Savage on her chest which drew her attention. Reacting, Tiwa via her Instagram handle wrote: “Yo you burst my brain with this permanent love oh. “I cannot get all the names of those that tattooed my name so I will just get a Savage soldier tattoo. I’m actually obsessed with my fans.”  Nigerians don’t support local celebrities – Don Jazzy laments
