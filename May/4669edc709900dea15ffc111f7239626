Stakeholders in Ogun State are no longer pleased with the perceived silence of Governor Dapo Abiodun over the recent gas explosions in Abeokuta, the state capital. About eight persons have died in four gas explosions in Abeokuta in the past nine days but the state government is yet to react to the sad development. A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Olumide Aderinokun in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Thursday by expressed worry over the recent gas explosions, asking the governor to wake up and save the people. Aderinokun lamented that Thursday’s incident at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library is the fourth gas-related explosion in Abeokuta in the past one week. The Akinruyiwa of Owu Kingdom called on Gov Abiodun to ‘wake up’ and carry out his constitutional duties and ensure people’s lives are protected. He also charged the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) to do more in ensuring only quality and international-standard cylinders get to the markets. “This is another unfortunate incident, the second this week. A government that is not sleeping should have been alerted that people are disturbed and some are dying due to the explosions. “No matter what the problem is, the government should play its role in ensuring standard gas cylinders are in circulation. It should ensure that the gas in the market is not adulterated. “This is troubling. We have lost eight of our people and the government is yet to talk or constitute a panel to investigate the explosions and proffer solutions. This is not how to govern a state. “The Standard of Organisation of Nigeria also needs to do more now because it is obvious some fake gas cylinders and adulterated gas are in the market. The PDP House of Representatives candidate commiserated with the families of the deceased persons, urging Ogun people and technicians to be careful.
