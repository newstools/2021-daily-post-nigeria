Dr. Miriam Ezekwe, the Southeast zonal coordinator for the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) has said the outbreak of COVID-19 adversely affected responses to the treatment of HIV/AIDs patients in Nigeria. The health expert said that the bulk of the resources mapped out for the treatment of HIV/AIDs patients in the country had been channelled towards combating the spread of COVID. She disclosed this in Owerri, Imo State capital while interacting with newsmen on Thursday. She said, “If not for the quick response of the federal government during the outbreak of AIDs, many more Nigerians would have died of it. Unfortunately, the attention of the FG has been shifted to COVID-19, which is believed to be the most killer disease. “Let me tell you, HIV/AIDS is killing more people in Nigeria than COVID-19 but many people do not know this. “Coronavirus is an airborne disease, but HIV/AIDs is a Sexually Transmitted Disease and you know what that means. “In Southeast, the number of HIV/AIDs patients are increasing by the day. Anambra State is the worst hit with a ratio of 2.4percent, Abia is 2.1, Enugu State is third with a ratio of 2.0 while Ebonyi State is 1.0.”
She appealed to the federal government to see the need to treat the two killer diseases with utmost priority because, according to her, HIV/AIDs is deadlier than COVID-19. COVID-19: Bauchi residents scared away from tuberculosis test – BACATMA chairman
