The security alert level in the nation’s capital, Abuja, has been raised to forestall the reported planned attacks by bandits. The Joint Security Team has directed security cover for different parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The team, chaired by FCT Police Commissioner, Bala Ciroma, comprises intelligence and paramilitary agencies. On Wednesday, a social media post said “about 800 Fulani men rode on horses approaching the Bwari Area Council FCT, Abuja.” The mission of the suspected bandits is unknown but residents said they are scared and urged the authorities to act speedily. Meanwhile, the management of Veritas University in Bwari has denied rumours that the school was shut to avert an invasion. A staff member told PRNigeria that the private university had been closed before the news about the sighting of the bandits. The source said staff and students proceeded on vacation after the last academic session of the university ended on Monday.
