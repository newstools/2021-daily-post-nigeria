Deji Adeyanju, an Abuja-based rights activist, has reacted to the death of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen Ibrahim Attahiru. Adeyanju questioned the death of Attahiru 24 hours after dreaded Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau was reported dead. On Thursday, reports emerged that Shekau was fatally injured, after attempting to kill himself to avoid being captured by rival Islamic State-allied fighters. There are also reports that he died by blowing up himself with a suicide vest. However, the Nigerian Army said that it was probing the reports indicating that Shekau was “badly injured” or “dead”. Similarly, Attahiru was reportedly killed in a plane crash in Kaduna. The COAS was said to have been killed alongside 10 others while on his way for an official assignment in Kaduna. Reacting to both incidents, the convener of Concerned Nigerian advocacy group wondered what was going on. In a tweet, Adeyanju wrote: “They said Shekau was killed yesterday. Today, the Chief of Army Staff died in a plane crash. Dear extremists in Govt, what is going on?” Imo prison attack: Criminals will use IPOB’s name to terrorize Nigerians – Deji Adeyanju
