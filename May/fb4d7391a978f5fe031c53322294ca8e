A 47-year-old woman, Olanshile Nasirudeen has allegedly stabbed her husband to death for impregnating another woman, DAILY POST reports. The suspect, our correspondent gathered, was the fourth wife of the 51-year-old deceased husband. The duo were co-butchers at an abattoir in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State. The woman was arrested following a distress call received by the DPO of Obalende divisional headquarters, Ijebu-Ode. The Ogun State Police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi told DAILY POST that Olanshile saw the woman recently impregnated by her husband at the abattoir, and started questioning the woman on why she had an affair with her husband. This, Oyeyemi said, led to a hot argument between her and the deceased. In the course of the melee, Oyeyemi said, “the suspect picked a knife, stabbed the deceased at the back joint of his left leg, thereby, cutting one of his veins.” He said “the man was quickly rushed to a nearby hospital for first aid, and later transferred to Ijebu-Ode General Hospital where he eventually gave up the ghost due to excessive bleeding.” The suspect, who ran away after stabbing her husband, was later arrested as the DPO of Obalende division, SP Murphy Salami, and his men trailed her to a hideout at Mobalufon area of Ijebu-Ode. “On interrogation, the suspect, who happened to be the fourth wife of the deceased, claimed that it was her husband who first slapped her simply because she asked his new wife her mission at her market stand. “The corpse of the deceased has been released to the family for burial in accordance with Islamic rites after the autopsy had been conducted on it,” Oyeyemi stated, adding that the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun has ordered the transfer of the suspect to the homicide section of the state CIID.
