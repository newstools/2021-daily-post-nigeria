The Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, on Tuesday, said some Nigerians were promoting an undemocratic removal of President Muhammadu Buhari. This was contained in his address to the media on the tension and insecurity in the country. Admitting the challenge, he described it as inaccurate, the belief that the federal government is overwhelmed and doesn’t have a clue as to how to tackle the situation. “Some have even gone as far as suggesting a truncation of the democratic order, a clearly treasonable stance,” Mohammed noted. He said the Buhari administration can deal with terrorism, kidnaping, banditry, farmer-herder conflict, and has the wherewithal to confront the crisis headlong for restore order and peace. According to Mohammed, one of the most difficult things to do, for a democratically-elected government, is to use the instruments of coercion against its own people. He said though the military have superior firepower over Boko Haram and ISWAP, the terrorists most often than not operate among the populace, either in villages or towns. The minister explained that the same applies to the kidnappers who seize school children. Mohammed said though the location of the captors is not unknown to the security forces, they must exercise caution to avoid harming the captives.
