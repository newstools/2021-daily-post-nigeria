Mr. Gimba Kumo, a former son-in-law to President Muhammadu Buhari, has claimed he was never invited by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) for the alleged misappropriation of $65m, before he was declared wanted. Kumo is alleged to have embezzled the money while he was Managing Director of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria. The ICPC declare him wanted alongside Tarry Rufus and Bola Ogunsola However, in a letter addressed to the Chairman of the ICPC, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, which is dated May 18, 2021, Kumo described the development as unfortunate, adding that no attempt was made at inviting him before he was declared wanted. The letter signed by his lawyer, Chief O.U Orji, and Uwem Umoawan, read in part, “We were reliably informed by our client that he was never served with any official invitation in line with Section 29, 30, 31, and 32 of the ICPC Act, 2000. “Since he left the FMBN, his private office and home addresses are well known to the public as both the DSS and the EFCC have also effected service/invitation to him personally which he honoured without any hesitation on the same issues as he does not have anything to hide.” Reactions as Buhari disowns son-in-law declared wanted by ICPC
