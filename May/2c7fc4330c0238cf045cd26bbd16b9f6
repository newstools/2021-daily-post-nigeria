The Northern Youths Council of Nigeria, NYCN, has expressed joy over the news of the timely response of Police Operatives in the interception, arrest and elimination of the IPOB/ESN terrorists that allegedly masterminded the gruesome assassination of Barr Ahmed Ali Gulak. Late Ahmed Gulak was a chieftain of the APC and one-time Political Adviser to former President Goodluck Jonathan. The statement signed by its President, Comrade Abubakar Isah, said, “The proactive approach of the joint security operation has in no small measure calmed the already frayed nerves in the Northern region, especially among the youths and renewed people’s confidence in the ability of the Police to stamp out criminal elements in the country if they are supported and willing to do so. The statement said, “While we withdraw our early threat on Governor Hope Ozodinma whom we issued an ultimatum for immediate arrest and prosecution of the culprits, we wish to reassure our loving Igbo brothers and sisters living in the Northern part of Nigeria of security and wellbeing as they share in our solidarity for a united, secured and prosperous nation.” The youth called on the Police and other security agencies to deploy similar energy in tackling other act of criminality across the nation including kidnapping, banditry and terrorism among others. “The way and manner they responded to the concern of the elites, they should also demonstrate same on plight peace-loving downtrodden masses.” While sending out heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and associates of Barr Gulak, the Northern Youth Council of Nigeria called for calm and warned against any form of reprisal as the security agencies are on top of the situation.
