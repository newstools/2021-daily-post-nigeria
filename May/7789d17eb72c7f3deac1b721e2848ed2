The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has arrested a 30-year-old alleged serial rapist in Sokoto State. Mr Umar Musa-Bala, the state Commandant of the NSCDC in Sokoto, told newsmen on Monday that the alleged suspect, Hamza Yusuf, defiled three minors. “We received a distress call that a serial rapist was arrested and was about to be lynched in the Mabera area of the state. ”We swiftly swung into action and rescued him from a mob who wanted to kill him and brought him to our office. ”We were able to identify three of his victims who are all below the age of 10 and medical investigation proved the defilement beyond a reasonable doubt,” Musa-Bala said Bala, however, added that the suspect would be released on bail because of the ongoing strike by the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria. ”He must produce a surety that is well recognized in society. Who will bring him to us on request,” he said In another development, Umar said the corps would deploy 700 personnel for the Eid–Al–Fitr, to monitor strategic areas, especially the flashy areas. He called on the citizens to report any suspicious movement in their areas to security agencies closer to them. Man admits raping 10-year-old in Kwara, victim’s family wants no-case
