A socio-cultural group, Ntighauzo Amairi Progressives, has lauded Governor Okezie Ikpeazu’s infrastructural stride, describing it as unprecedented in the history of Abia State. In a statement signed by its President, Adindu Johnson, the group explained that some projects such as Agalaba Ring Road, are legacies that will outlive decades after the governor’s reign. The Abia group said it is appreciative of the governor’s benevolence which has immensely benefited sons and daughters of the community. While the group prays for the governor’s intervention on the road linking Ukpakiri-Abayi- Ntighauzo and other neighbouring communities, it prayed that the governor considers sons and daughters of the community for key appointments in his government. It will be recalled that the road is a feeder road that links some Abia communities with some Akwa Ibom communities. Ntighauzo Amairi Progressives also thanked the governor for his support and cordial relationship with one of their sons, a member representing Obingwa East State Constituency and the leader of Abia House of Assembly, Hon. Solomon Akpulonu. Ntighauzo Amairi Progressives earnestly prayed for God’s continued guidance and protection to the governor and his family. 2023: Your destiny is in your hands – Akpabio tells Akwa Ibom people
