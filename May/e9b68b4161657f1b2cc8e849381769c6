The Jigawa State governor Alhaji Muhammed Badaru Abubakar has said the State has enough to pay its workers’ salaries despite NNPC threat of
zero remittance to the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) for the month of April 2021. The Governor gave the assurance while addressing workers at the May day celebration to mark the international workers’ day at the Ahmadu Bello Hall in Dutse, the capital of Jigawa. He assured civil servants in the state of his commitment to continue to pay N30,000 minimum wage salaries and pensions within the next months despite the warning that there may be zero Federal allocation in subsequent months. “I was earlier accused of keeping money and not spending because we know a time like this will surely come and the time is now. “When we come, we knew this day would come when we might not get anything from the government because of dwindling oil prices. And couple with the global pandemic the economy of the country has suffered more. “We cut government spending, and have saved right from then. Government house expenditure and that of the Deputy Governor’s office were first to be affected. This is all because of times like this. “Workers in Jigawa should remain calm as their salaries would be paid as and when due. Also for pensioners and those who are retiring all their benefits would be paid on time,” Badaru added. The Chairman of the Nigerian Labour Congress, Mr. Sunusi Alhassan commend the Governor for his efforts to ensure payment of the workers’ salaries. This is coming at the time when the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said there will be zero remittance to the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) for the month of April 2021, due to fuel subsidy payment.
