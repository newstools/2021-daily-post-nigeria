Ondo Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has reiterated that the decision of the Southern Governors to ban open grazing was irreversible. “Those having these animals should also ranch them,” Akeredolu stated. He made the remark at the 2021 Annual Conference of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) – Section on Public Interest and Development Law (SPIDEL) in Ibadan. Akeredolu stressed that governors have a duty to protect all citizens, including the herders. The Ondo helmsman regretted how the usual grazing style led to several problems and conflicts over the years. He urged the federal government to assist those that want to do ranching like the support extended to farmers on rice production. “The national livestock programme is so important and must be supported by the Federal Government to save lives.” Akeredolu said criminals using forests to perpetrate killings and kidnappings would no longer be tolerated. At the same event, Bauchi Governor Bala Mohammed advised his colleagues and the elites to handle the open grazing ban carefully. Open Grazing: Why Nigerian govt should support ranching – Okowa
