The Nigerian Army has promised to suppress the security challenges in various parts of the country. Maj.-Gen. Danjumma Ali-Keffi, General Officer Commanding 1 Division, Kaduna, spoke during the passing out of 80 regular recruit intakes. At the event held at Depot Nigeria Army Zaria on Saturday, no fewer than 6,000 soldiers graduated. Ali-Keffi, the Reviewing Officer and Special Guest of Honour said the army will not rest until the country is safe for all. He noted that since its establishment in 1924, the Depot has the mandate of transforming able-bodied civilians into soldiers to meet the manpower requirement of the Nigeria Army. “It is noteworthy that as you pass out today, the strength of Nigeria army has been enhanced by 6,400 able-bodied men and women.” The GOC added that the Depot has been able to evolve innovative ways of improving the standard of training in the Nigeria Army. Ali-Keffi noted that the Nigeria Army has been yielding a positive result, which is evident by the robust fighting spirit of the soldiers in various theatre of operations. “With the excellent display of drill exhibited on this parade ground today, I am certain that you have acquired the basic training that is required of you to be good soldiers.’’ The senior officers told the soldiers to always abide by their Oath of Allegiance and to avoid acts that are capable of tarnishing the image of the Army and Nigeria. The late Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru was to be the Reviewing Officer and Special Guest. Gunshots were fired in his honour and others who died in the Kaduna air crash last Friday evening. Unions’ strike: Details of Chris Ngige’s meeting with Buhari emerge
