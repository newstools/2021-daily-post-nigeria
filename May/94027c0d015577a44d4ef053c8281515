A resident of the area told DAILY POST that some boys discovered the remains of the baby neatly packed in a sack while scavenging at the dump at Takur Site Quarters. Spokesman of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), SC Adamu Shehu, confirmed the discovery to DAILY POST. He said the dead baby was found on Sunday 16th May, 2021, around 1:30 pm. “I personally received a phone call from my plumber who lives in Tukur Site, Dutse, that what looks like a dead and abandoned baby neatly packaged in a sack was discovered by a group of boys while scavenging at a waste disposal site,” Adamu said. He explained that immediately after the call, the NSCDC response team was mobilised to the scene. He said on arrival, it was discovered that part of the baby’s body was already consumed by fire at the dump site. The NSCDC spokesman said so far nobody has been arrested in connection with the crime.
