The relative of the Afrobeat pioneer, Fela Anikulapo Kuti has condemned the use of the music legend’s name/image on clothes bearing ‘Jagaban’. Jagaban is one of the nicknames of a prominent politician and former Lagos Governor, Bola Tinubu. The traditional title was conferred on the All Progressives Congress (APC) leader by the Emir of Borgu in Niger State, Haliru Dantoro Kitoro. Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, campaign materials bearing the Tinubu or Jagaban or Asiwaju (Tinubu’s traditional title in Lagos) have appeared in circulation. In a statement, Fela’s son, Femi said he saw the tweet by the APC and confirmed Fela’s name on the T-shirts bearing ‘Jagaban’ was never authorized. Femi declared that the family owns the trademark and the use of it constitutes an infringement and disregard of their legal rights. The Afrobeat star warned the party to desist from using Fela’s image, adding that the family does not align with any political party in Nigeria or beyond. “We are carefully assessing the situation and failure to comply with this demand will leave us with no other option but to explore any legal options that are available to us”, he added.
