Uganda’s incumbent president, Yoweri Museveni, was sworn in on Wednesday, for his sixth five-year term in office. Chief Justice, Alfonse Chigamoy Owiny-Dollo administered oath of office at Kololo Independence Grounds in Kampala. “I, Yoweri Tibuhaburwa Kaguta Museveni swear in the name of the Almighty God that I shall faithfully exercise the functions of the president of Uganda”, Museveni said. The President swore to uphold the constitution, observe the laws of Uganda and promote the welfare of the people. The ceremony was attended by 11 African heads of state, government representatives, diplomats and other dignitaries. Hundreds of his ruling National Resistance Movement party supporters were present. Museveni, 76, first assumed office in 1986. The opposition and critics insist the President manipulated the wishes of the people just to remain in office.
