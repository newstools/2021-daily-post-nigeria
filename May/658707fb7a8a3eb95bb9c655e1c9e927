Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said the team’s next challenge is to play in two finals and finish in the Premier League top four this season. The German also told his players they had won nothing yet, even as they stand on the brink of a Champions League and FA Cup double. Ahead of Wednesday night’s game against Arsenal, which could see the Blues move a step closer to securing a top-four finish, Tuchel insisted his team still need to get the job done. Chelsea faces Leicester City in the FA Cup final on Saturday and Manchester City two weeks later in the Champions League final. “We haven’t won anything yet and it doesn’t help if we talk about it. “We have to play two finals and finish in the top four. This is the challenge and it’s not finished. “If the pressure mounts and mounts and increases all the time it can be a huge next step to keep the level up. This is what we do at the moment and this is what the surrounding forces us to do because all three challenges are big. “We are in the middle of the race for top four, we have two finals to come and you can only achieve it if you are on a consistently high level mentally and physically, with a good atmosphere, and this is what we try to keep now. “Nobody is allowed now to drop one per cent, because that’s what makes it special right now. But now is not finished. It is not the time for praise, not the time for reflection, it is the time to continue and finish the job,” Tuchel said.
