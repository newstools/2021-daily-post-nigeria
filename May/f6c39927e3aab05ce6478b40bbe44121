The Kaduna State government has said that power is yet to be restored in the State despite the suspension of strike by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC). Recall that the NLC which embarked on a five-day industrial action to protest the recent disengagement of civil servants by the state government, suspended the strike on Wednesday. The National President of NLC, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, said the move was to honour the invitation of the Federal Government on Thursday. However, a statement released by El-Rufai’s spokesperson Muyiwa Adekeye, said the Kaduna State government was yet to see evidence that the NLC is backing off from its campaign of economic and social sabotage. Adekeye lamented that the electric power is yet to be restored after it was shut down on Sunday. According to him, “those who disrupted the power supply should promptly reverse themselves, not expect that it will be a matter for negotiation.” “Denying our people electricity about 18 hours to the advertised commencement of their organized sabotage was akin to putting a gun on the government’s head. “The Kaduna State Government is yet to see evidence that the NLC is backing off from its campaign of economic and social sabotage against the people of the State. “Restoring electricity is vital to relieving some of the pain that needless acts of lawlessness have inflicted on our people. “Those who have disrupted it should promptly reverse themselves, not expect that it will be a matter for negotiation. “KDSG will not participate in such a negotiation whilst our people are still being denied their right to electricity.” Boko Haram: Electricity restored in Maiduguri two months after terrorists shut down lines
