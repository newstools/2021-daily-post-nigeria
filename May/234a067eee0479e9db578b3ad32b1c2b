Senator Rochas Okorocha, representing Imo West senatorial district, has said that becoming the Governor of Imo State made him poorer.

Okorocha, therefore, dared anyone to come forth with evidence that he is corrupt and mismanaged Imo State funds while in office. “I challenge anybody to prove that I acquired any property with any government fund,” Okorocha said. “I think people have forgotten that I was Rochas before becoming the governor of Imo State; I think they have forgotten completely. “If anything, becoming a governor made me even poorer than what I was in the past.
