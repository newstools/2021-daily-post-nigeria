We heard the utterances of the Kaduna State Governor that he will not pay ransom to bandits to purchase additional arms. “If they fail to bring N100 million and 10 brand-new Honda motorcycles known as Boko Haram by Tuesday, I can assure you they will use trucks to evacuate the bodies of the remaining students,” he said.
