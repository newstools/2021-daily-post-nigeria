The 196 councillor candidates of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Cross River State have handed over party flags in their possession to the new leader in the state, Governor Ben Ayade. Handing over the flags, which is the symbol of the party, the Cross River State APC Councilor Candidates Forum, led by Comrade Effiom Raymond Yellow-Duke, said the divisions in the party had caused them to remove all the flags from the factional offices in the state. “The disparaged division in the CRS APC necessitated the formation of CRS APC Councilor Candidates Forum by the 196 councillor candidates of the 18 Local Government Area in Cross River State with the sole objective to enthrone peace in the CRS APC with only one State Exco and one Party Secretariat respectively,” he said. “Based on the disparage nature which cost them the local government elections in 2020, the forum members were aggrieved especially when some of them sold their properties including cars, buildings, electronics as well as furniture and invested the money, yet they were denied tickets. “As last resort, they went on rampage to all the factions’ secretariat and removed the flag, pledged their continued loyalty and support to him and the State Caretaker Committee of the party “We hope as a forum for continued partnership with your CareTaker Committee in building and development of our great party in Cross River State and the Nation in general.” He disclosed that the way they were treated by the factions led to the forceful closure of all secretariats with the one situated at Okoi Arikpo Estate along Marian Road and the other along the same road. “Removal of the flags followed by the closure of APC offices and locking of the gates with chains, no doubt, this singular action drew applause and commendation by APC members in the state,” he said. Comrade Yellow Duke said, “We wish to thank the Almighty father for enabling the forum to attain to its sole and hallowed objective, enabling the coming into existence of one functional State Caretaker Committee in one party Secretariat, in Calabar. “Sir, it is in the light of the above, that we as a forum and vanguards to the said feat, resulting in the harmonization, unity and oneness in CRS APC, that we wish to very formally return all the party symbol (flags) to your exalted office, that were taken by the forum during the forceful closure of the factional secretariats for your continued use and hoist stage in our new Party Secretariat under your able leadership.” Police nab four suspects for unlawful possession of firearms in Kogi
