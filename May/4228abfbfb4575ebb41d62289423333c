Former Barcelona goalkeeper, Francesc Arnau is dead. He passed away on Saturday morning at the age of 46. Spanish club, Real Oviedo, confirmed his death in a tweet via their Twitter account. “Our sports director, Francesc Arnau Grabalosa, has passed away,” Real Oviedo’s tweet read. “We deeply regret her loss and accompany her family through these difficult times. Rest in peace.” Arnau had been working as Director of Sport at Real Oviedo since December 2019. He started out in Barcelona’s youth teams, working his way up to the first-team squad, where he spent three seasons from 1998 to 2001. The former shot-stopper left Barcelona in 2001 to sign for Málaga.
