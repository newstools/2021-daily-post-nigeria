In mourning the late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, the United States says Nigeria is going through difficult time. The US Mission in Nigeria issued a statement on Friday night. America joined Nigerians in mourning the loss of life from the plane crash in Kaduna. The world power called the demise of Attahiru and others as “a tremendous loss to Nigeria, and his loved ones”. “During this difficult time across Nigeria when security and peace is so needed, we offer our deepest sympathy to the family of General Attahiru and to the families of all those who perished,” it read. Nigerians are in shock over the news with different claims and theories. While some say the aircraft might have developed a fault, others alleged assassination. One of Attahiru’s last public engagements was his appearance at the House of Representatives in April. Attahiru said his predecessors are in a better position to speak on arms funds approved by the federal government. The Adhoc Committee on Arms and Ammunition Purchase, had asked him to explain the summary on contracts executed by the Nigerian Army. Chaired by Hon. Olaide Akinremi, the committee is reviewing the purchase and use of arms, ammunition, and related hardware by the military, paramilitary, and other agencies. The departed COAS told them he could not provide explanation because he did not authorize any contract. “The period for which you wanted this report, having been summarized in the Executive Summary, explains whatever details you will require,” he said. Noting that procurement “were done by specific individuals,” Attahiru advised the Green Chamber of the National Assembly to invite them to give adequate answers.
