Former Chelsea captain, John Terry has mocked Tottenham after Aston Villa’s 2-1 victory over the north Londoners on Wednesday night. Tottenham went ahead early on through Steven Bergwijn but Villa scored two goals in quick succession through Sergio Reguilon’s own goal and Ollie Watkins’ strike. It means that Spurs have lost their last home game which was played in front of their fans and their hopes of a Europa League finish all but evaporated. Now seventh place in the Premier League table, Spurs now need to beat Leicester City on Sunday and hope West Ham lose to Southampton in order to finish in the Europa League spots. Spurs supporters had mocked Aston Villa coach John Terry, singing a chant about Ledley King (‘Oh Ledley, Ledley, He’s better than John Terry’) which belittles the Chelsea legend. Terry responded by turning to the supporters and lifting an imaginary trophy, having won significantly more honours than Spurs while at Chelsea. The former Chelsea star then continued mocking Tottenham on Instagram after the match, sharing a post of his banter with the Spurs fans and adding 17 trophy emojis as well as two crying-laughing emojis. He also took another dig at Tottenham in a post of his own, referencing the fact that Chelsea used to call White Hart Lane ‘Three Point Lane’ because they had such a good record there. “Great way to bounce back tonight,” he wrote. I enjoyed that one. “Superb team performance. Different stadium, same old story. Three points…”  Ex-Chelsea captain, John Terry set to become manager of Premier League club
