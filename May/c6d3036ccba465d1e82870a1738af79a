Manchester United may be set for glory in the Europa League final on Wednesday, but the club has already pocketed millions on their way to the final. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men face Villarreal in Gdansk, a chance for the Norwegian to win his first silverware since joining the club in 2018. United began their European season in the group stage of the Champions League, where they earned €23.35million (around £16.4m). The total amount earned included the initial €15.25m (£10.7m) for taking part in the pool. The Red Devils, despite not going far in the elite competition, are likely to also pocket €20m (£14.4m) from TV revenue. However, their dominance in the Europa League has led to more financial reward as the base fee for the competition gave United €2.92m. Their last-32 victory over Real Sociedad saw them win €0.5m and their last-16 win over AC Milan added another €1.1m to the pot. Another €1.5m was claimed when United defeated Granada in the quarter-finals and a further €2.4m was won after their semi-final victory over Roma. The final will add even more money with the losing fee amounting to €4.5m and if they win they will bag €8.5m. Europa League final: Owen predicts result for Villarreal vs Man United tie
