Nigerian workers have opposed the plan by the federal government to slash their salaries. Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) President, Ayuba Wabba, noted that the plan was tantamount to a “mass suicide”. Wabba regretted that the government is contemplating to unilaterally cut the salaries of civil servants. The labour leader described the declaration by Finance Minister, Zainab Ahmed as extremely horrendous. “The question is which salary is the government planning to slash? It certainly cannot be the meager national minimum wage of N30, 000, which right now cannot even buy a bag of rice”, he noted. Wabba said workers are only alive by hair’s breadth, adding that their survival is a miracle. The NLC president advised the government to cut the humongous remuneration and allowances pocketed by political office holders. He stressed that workers generate revenue for the government, and do not constitute any unnecessary cost or burden to governance.
