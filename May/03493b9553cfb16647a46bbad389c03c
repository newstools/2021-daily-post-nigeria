Former Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has suggested he would not mind dropping back into the Championship for his next managerial role. Lampard is out of work since the Blues sacked him in January. The 42-year-old has now said he does not “have an ego” because he has managed a team in the Champions League and could make a return to the second tier. Lampard’s first managerial job was in the Championship with Derby County. He led the Rams to the play-off final in his only season there, before he returned to Chelsea as manager in 2019. “I’m not rushing into anything but if the opportunity arises and it’s the right one then I want to work again. “I love working in management more than I thought I would. “I would take a view on going into the Championship. If it was the right club, the right project, for sure. I don’t have an ego where I feel just because I’ve managed in the Champions League, that’s the be-all and end-all,” Lampard told the UK Times.
