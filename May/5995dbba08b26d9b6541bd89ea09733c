Former Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted he regrets not signing former England attacking midfielder, Paul Gascoigne during his time at Old Trafford. Gascoigne, popularly known as Gazza, enjoyed spells at Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio, Rangers, Middlesbrough, Burnley and Everton during his football career. Gazza was close to signing for Man United in the late-1980s and Ferguson believes the move would have been huge for the Premier League giants. Asked which player he regrets not signing for Man United, Ferguson told his former player Gary Neville for LADbibleTV: “Gascoigne, without question. “I think he was the best English player since Bobby Charlton. I think he was a fantastic player. ‘Unfortunately, we didn’t get him and I think, looking back now, he made a big mistake. He recognised it himself years later. “But we had Geordies in the camp. We had Bobby Charlton, Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, even Gary Pallister from Middlesbrough.” He added, “We had people there who would have taken care of him, particularly Bryan Robson, who is fantastic with players. “Instead, he goes to an island in London, and you are easily swallowed up there as a young lad. I think that was a big mistake by him. He was a marvellous player. I loved his strength. We played Newcastle up there and he had just come back from injury.” Sir Alex Ferguson ‘lambasted’ me over red card – Solskjaer
