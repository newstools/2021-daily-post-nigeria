Three clubs, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus from the original 12 breakaway European Super Leagues teams, have penned a joint communique after UEFA confirmed its plan to prepare disciplinary action against them. Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juvnetus, in a joint communique issued via their websites simultaneously on Saturday morning, complained about external ‘pressure’ and ‘threats’. UEFA had said on Friday that the nine clubs who withdraw from the plan had signed a ‘Club Commitment Declaration’ as well as a series of “reintegration” steps. The six Premier League clubs – Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal – along with Inter Milan, AC Milan and Atlético Madrid, all signed the agreement. The issued by the three club reads in part, “In relation to the statement released by UEFA on the 7th May in respect of the Super League and the position taken by nine of its founding clubs, Fútbol Club Barcelona, Juventus and Real Madrid Club de Fútbol state the following: “The founding clubs have suffered, and continue to suffer, unacceptable third-party pressures, threats, and offenses to abandon the project and therefore desist from their right and duty to provide solutions to the football ecosystem via concrete proposals and constructive dialogue. “This’s intolerable under the rule of law and Tribunals have already ruled in favour of the Super League proposal, ordering FIFA and UEFA to, either directly or through their affiliated bodies, refrain from taking any action which may hinder this initiative in any way while court proceedings are pending. “We regret to see that our friends and founding partners of the Super League project have now found themselves in such inconsistent and contradictory position when signing a number of commitments to UEFA yesterday. “
