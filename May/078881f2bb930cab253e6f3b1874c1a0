The Abia government has confirmed that the Mike Okiro Police Station located along Umuahia-Uzoakoli road, close to the Ubani market, was attacked Sunday morning. John Kalu, Information Commissioner in a statement said the gunmen moved in a bus, 2 Sienna vehicles and 3 motorcycles. Two vehicles, two motorcycles, stationeries and office equipment inside the police station were set on fire. Kalu said no human casualties or loss of weapons were recorded as the personnel and armoury were relocated three weeks ago. The government condemned the attack and warned the culprits that they would not escape the long arm of the law. Kalu noted that attacks on security agents constitutes a danger to everyone and urged citizens and leaders to jointly end “the needless and mindless acts”. “Those who feel aggrieved must find peaceful means of ventilating their grievances and agitate for redress as provided for in our constitution rather than take the laws into their hands”, the statement read. The Okezie Ikpeazu-led administration advised residents to maintain vigilance, go about their normal businesses and obey the 8.00pm. to 6.00 am curfew.
