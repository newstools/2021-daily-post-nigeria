Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has admitted that if Sergio Aguero’s penalty had made it 2-0 before half time, they wouldn’t have stood a chance of beating Manchester City on Saturday. The Blues came back from a goal down to beat Pep Guardiola’s men 2-1 at the Etihad. Raheem Sterling gave the hosts the lead, before Aguero’s weak panenka was saved easily by Eduoard Mendy. Tuchel’s men then scored through Hakim Ziyech and Marcos Alonso to grab all three points. “What a performance in the second half. If they score the penalty maybe it’s over before it really starts and then you go to half time 2-0 with no chances to come back. “I was impressed with the reaction in the second half and think we deserved to win in the second half. “When you’re 1-0 down at the Etihad you need a bit of luck, some decisions, but it goes like this we had many half chances and chances. A big congratulations to the team for the second half. “We had more control, confidence, the first goal helped us. We could play more physically and recover the balls higher. It was a physical battle and we increased our motivation,” Tuchel said. The result lifts Chelsea into third in the Premier League table, six points ahead of fifth-placed West Ham in the race for the top-four. David Moyes’ Hammers have just four games to make up the five-point gap to Leicester in fourth. Man City vs Chelsea: Guardiola reacts to Aguero’s penalty miss at Etihad
