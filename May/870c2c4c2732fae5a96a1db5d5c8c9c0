A former Nigerian Minister, Mama Taraba, real name Aisha Jummai Al-Hassan, is dead. Al-Hassan, 61, served as Women Affairs Minister under the President Muhammadu Buhari government. Her associates confirmed the politician died on Friday in Cairo, the Egyptian capital. Mama Taraba dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC) to contest the 2019 governorship election under United Democratic Party (UDP). Al-Hassan, a staunch supporter of former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, defected to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) months after the poll. In August 2020, she made revelations about her ordeal while in the APC. She ran into trouble with the ruling party after declaring her support for Atiku’s presidential ambition.
