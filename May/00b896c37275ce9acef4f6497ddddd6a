A Malian woman has given birth to nine babies at once. This happened on Tuesday and it was two more than doctors had detected inside her crowded womb. She joins a very small pantheon of mothers of nonuplets. The 25-year-old Halima Cisse’s pregnancy had fascinated Malians and attracted the attention of its leaders. Doctors in the country had in March 2021 told Cisse she needed specialist care and the country’s authorities flew her to Morocco, where she gave birth. “The newborns (five girls and four boys) and the mother are all doing well,” Mali’s health minister, Fanta Siby, said in a statement, according to NAN. Ultrasounds conducted in Morocco and Mali had indicated that the 25-year-old was expected to give birth to seven babies, meaning that the checks missed two of the siblings. All were delivered by caesarean section. Nonuplets are extremely rare. Medical complications in multiple births of this kind often mean that some of the babies do not reach full term.
