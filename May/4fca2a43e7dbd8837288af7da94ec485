Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has vehemently condemned the abduction of Abia State University students. The students were kidnapped along Okigwe-Uturu Road, between the boundary road linking Abia and Imo States yesterday. Ohanaeze in a statement signed by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, Secretary-General of the apex Igbo socio-cultural group and made available to DAILY POST on Thursday, said “the introduction of Northern styles) of abduction of students in the South East has reinforced our suspicions that Northern bandits are operating in the South East.” Continuing, Ohanaeze Ndigbo noted that “The new dimensions and twists shows that Northern bandits and herdsmen had infiltrated Southeast.” The organisation said that the rivalry between the two security outfits in the region, the Ebubeagu and Eastern Security Network, ESN, created loopholes for Igboland to be invaded by sponsored terrorists and hoodlums. “Southeast Governors should reach out to President Muhammadu Buhari for the search and rescue of these abducted students. “Presidency should prove Igbos wrong this time, by using all the available procedures FG had employed in the recent past in rescuing abducted students in the North to free abducted ABSU students.”
