Residents of the riverine community, Ayetoro, Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State have threatened to relocate to Aso Rock and the National Assembly, following the incessant sea incursion ravaging them. The residents made the threat while alleging a blind eye to their plight by the government, despite battling the sea incursion for years. The community explained that most parts of the ancient land had been submerged and had caused them unbearable pains and loss. DAILY POST had in 2020 reported how over 2,000 people were displaced and 200 houses destroyed in an ocean surge in the community. With pains and agonies evident on the faces of the residents, the destructive mark of the sea incursion could be seen in every part of the community.  The moderator of the Ilaje Advancement Forum, Daodu Juwon said if the government continue to ignore their plight, the people of Ayetoro will be left with no option than to relocate to Aso Rock, National Assembly as well as the Governor’s office, Alagbaka, Akure, the state capital. While berating the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, for ignoring the mandate areas, Juwon called on the House of Representative member from the constituency, Kolade Akinjo to stop playing dumb to the situation at hand. “We expect that he should be up and doing beyond purchasing JAMB form which is the job of a councillor. He should rise to his responsibilities and hold contractors into account.”  A resident of the community, Grace Lelawa said, everyone is now scared of being swept off by the sea, alleging that the government had abandoned the community at the mercy of the natural disaster. The traditional ruler of the town, Oba Olorunmbe Ojagbohun who described the situation as devastating appealed to the government at all levels and Nigerians to come to the aid of the community.
