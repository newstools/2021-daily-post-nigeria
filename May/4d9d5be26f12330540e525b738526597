Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has told Callum Hudson-Odoi that his best position at the Blues is the right wing-back. Tuchel also advised the England international to learn how to push himself to the absolute limit. The German disclosed this during his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash against Arsenal on Wednesday night at Stamford Bridge. Hudson-Odoi has been played in a variety of positions this season, but the 20-year-old has struggled to break into Tuchel’s first-team plans. “In the last weeks, there have been some tough decisions against Callum Hudson-Odoi because we played many times against a back five,” Tuchel said. “We relied a bit more on learned defensive guys like Azpi and Reecey and did not take the risk to play against another back five with Callum as a wing-back. “On the inside position [right wing-back], where he played against Man City, this is maybe his best position. We agree on that. “The big change and the big impact he had when we brought him on was not only one action; within one action, it was two or three accelerations and decelerations. “From his position, it’s about assisting, it’s about scoring. We don’t need to talk about it. It’s about putting things to an end.” He added, “He needs to understand how to push himself to the absolute limit, and not be happy with 80, 85, 90, 95 per cent. He simply cannot be happy with that in any single day. “He needs to learn and understand that and live up to that. Once he does this, he will make his way and leave his footprints.” EPL: Tuchel announces Pulisic’s new position ahead of Chelsea vs Crystal Palace clash
