Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has suggested three players the club should sign this summer. Neville urged the Red Devils to make a move for Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho, Tottenham’s Harry Kane and Real Madrid’s Raphael Varane in the transfer window. According to him, Sancho, Kane and Varane are exactly the types of players manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer needs at Old Trafford to compete with Manchester City for the Premier League title next season. Man City won the 2020/21 Premier League title ahead of Man United, who finished second on the log. Asked in a Twitter Q&A: ‘Where can Man Utd finish next season with the right signings?’ Neville replied: “Varane, Kane and Sancho = title.” Meanwhile, Kane, who will leave Tottenham this summer, has been linked with a move to United, while Sancho and Varane have been linked with moves to the club in the past. Man United will tackle Villarreal in the Europa League final on Wednesday. EPL: Premier League announces 23-player shortlist for Hall of Fame [Full list]
