Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has claimed that securing Premier League top-four finish with victory against Aston Villa on Sunday will ease some of the pressure on his players in their Champions League final clash against Manchester City on May 29 in Portugal. Tuchel disclosed this during his pre-match press conference on Friday. The German also urged his players to finish what they have started in the league and get the job done by securing the right result against Aston Villa at Villa Park. “For sure, Of course it takes some pressure off. But I don’t think when we arrive next week in the Champions League final that will be in any of our heads. “When you prepare the final in the last two days, we will not play this final to make it to Champions League next season. “This final we will play 100 per cent no matter what, to win the cup. This is it and the side effect is of course a crucial one but I will not turn it around, we don’t want to play this final to arrive in the top four (Champions League). “We put so much hard work and quality and got a consistent amount of results into the last months that we want to finish the job on Sunday and we know it’s going to be tough but we don’t know what expects us in detail. “Anything can happen in the 90 minutes of football and this is what everybody loves about this game that three teams have a chance to catch two places so the race is on,” Tuchel said.
