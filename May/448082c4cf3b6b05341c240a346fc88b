The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has invited the former Governor of Kwara State, Abdulfatah Ahmed, for questioning, over alleged diversion of N9billion. Channels TV reports that sources at the anti-graft agency said the former Governor is currently being grilled by a crack team of operatives at the headquarters of the EFCC in Jabi Abuja. According to the source, Ahmed arrived the EFCC headquarters around 10am on Monday to honour an invitation by the agency. “And for the past seven hours, he has been in the interrogation room, writing statements. “Though details of the case are still sketchy as of press time, I think it is connected to how funds to the tune of about N9billion were diverted from the coffers of Kwara State Government during his tenure as Governor of Kwara state between 2011 and 2019. “He is also expected to account for his time as Commissioner for Finance in the administration of Bukola Saraki, a former President of the Senate,” the source said. EFCC Head of Media and Publicity, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed the former governor responded to the commission’s invitation. Uwujaren, however, didn’t offer further details.
