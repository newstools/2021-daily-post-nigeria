The Osun State Police Command on Saturday evening foiled a kidnap and robbery attempt on motorists by suspected herdsmen along Akure/ Ilesa road. Police spokesperson in Osun State, SP Yemisi Opalola, in a statement on Sunday said the kidnappers came out of the bush and attempted robbing motorists at Iwaraja along Akure/Ilesa road, around 6 pm. Opalola said the quick intervention of the Police, JTF and other local security outfits stopped the robbery and kidnapping. While reacting to a viral video, Opalola said the man talking in the video thought the kidnappers had abducted the drivers, not knowing that they ran away to safety. “They hid themselves somewhere and later came out, the Police were with them until the last vehicle left. “The DPO of Ijebu-Jesa ensured the safety of the motorists as the owners of the vehicles later came out and carried their vehicles away.” The police spokesperson said the Commissioner of Police in the State, CP Olawale Olokode wants the kidnappers arrested by all means as an intensive manhunt has been launched in order to apprehend the perpetrators.
