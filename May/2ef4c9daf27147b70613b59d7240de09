Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has revealed that captain, Harry Maguire, feels ‘positive’ about whether he will be fit for the Red Devils’ Europa League final against Villarreal on May 26. Maguire picked up an ankle injury in Man United’s 3-1 win against Aston Villa some days ago, marking him as a doubt for the Europa League final against Villarreal. Providing an update on Maguire ahead of Man United’s Premier League clash with Fulham on Tuesday, Solskjaer said at his pre-match press conference: “Hopefully we can have good news early, but I will give it a while on Harry [Maguire]. “He’s shown his importance. I felt I became a very good player when I was injured. People realise what you can do. “Harry is our leader and he’s been a big miss at the moment. I will give him as long as he needs before he says yes or no. “He’s making progress, but we don’t want to test it out too early. Harry wants this so much, but he doesn’t want to take risks either. “When I spoke to him this morning, he was quite positive. We have to be positive and think he’s going to make it, until we have to say no. I have always been an optimist.” EPL: Solskjaer names player Man Utd missed during 4-2 defeat to Liverpool
