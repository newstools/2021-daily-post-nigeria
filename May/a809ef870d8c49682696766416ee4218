In order to put an end to incessant killings in Benue State, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has suggested that the state needs someone like Sunday Adeyemo (aka Sunday Igboho). Sunday Igboho became popular recently when he sent away Fulani herdsmen and their Seriki from Igangan, Oyo State and Eggua in Ogun State. The man, who paraded himself as a Yoruba freedom fighter, has repeatedly called on herdsmen to vacate the Southwest, while agitating for a Yoruba nation. With the reported killings in Benue State, Omokri opined that the state must get their own Sunday Igboho if they want an end to incessant loss of lives. He accused President Muhammadu Buhari of taking sides with cows whenever there is a clash in Benue, saying the state needs an Igboho that will side with them. Omokri charged those who see themselves as fighters in the state to take after Sunday Igboho by defending their communities. He said, “Except Benue gets their own Sunday Igboho, these almost daily attacks that have characterised #BenueUnderAttack will continue to happen. If Benue people clash with cows, General Buhari will ALWAYS side with cows. “Benue needs an Igboho that will side with them. “In Benue, we read about people who fight at universities and who fight their brothers. Can these people not channel their energies into protecting their communities? “Look at Igboho. He is not huge or hefty. Yet, when they hear his name, they shiver like Shenzi shivers when the name Mufasa is mentioned!” Omokri submitted on his social media handles. No fewer than 36 residents of Shikaan Mbagena Kpav community in Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State were said to have been killed on Thursday night by armed men suspected to be Fulani militias. No govt in Nigeria, Buhari helping Fulanis take over – Ortom
