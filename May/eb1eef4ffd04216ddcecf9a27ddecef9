The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has created additional 1,235 polling units in Imo State. The state INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Prof. Francis Ezeonu made this known while briefing newsmen on Wednesday, NAN reports. Ezeonu said over the years, there had been attempts by the commission to create additional polling units to cater to the interest of new settlements and areas with unmanageable voter population. He explained that in 2011, the commission opted to create voting points and voting settlements to address the issue of overcrowding during elections and new settlements not served by existing polling units. Ezeonu said the 1,235 new units created brings the total of polling units in the state to 4,758. The INEC REC said the additional polling units were in line with the expectation of the law which provided that “the Commission establish a sufficient number of polling units in each Registration Area and allot voters to such polling units.” Ezeonu said the commission would continue to improve the quality of access to electoral services provided to voters by ensuring better access to polling units for persons with disabilities. “The commission has also decided to improve the health and safety conditions at polling units during elections in order to comply with COVID-19 protocols as well as address declining voter turnout at elections due to lack of access to polling units,” he said.
