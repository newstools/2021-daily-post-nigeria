The Nigerian Government has submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) interim report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The move is part of its commitment to the Paris Agreement on global action in checking climate crisis. A statement by the Director Press, Federal Ministry of Environment, Saghir el Mohammed said the document is part of the requirements needed to qualify Nigeria to compete in the 2021 Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA). Submitting the report on behalf of the Nigerian Government, the Minister of Environment, Dr Muhammad Mahmood Abubakar who submitted the report on behalf of the federal government, said Nigeria has continued to move towards meeting its NDC. “This action underscores our determination to achieve the commitment we signed in 2015 to reduce Nigeria’s carbon emissions unconditionally by 20% and 45% conditionally with international support by 2030,” he said. The minister explained that the proposal introduced by NAMA is an opportunity provided by Germany, the Federal Ministry of Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety to mobilize funds for Climate Action around the world.
