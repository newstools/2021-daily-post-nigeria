Sgt Adesina Opeyemi Deeziah, one of the crew members of the Beachcraft 350 aircraft that crashed at the Kaduna International Airport also claiming the life of Nigeria’s Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru on Friday, died less than a month after sharing a post predicting ‘bloody May’ and asking for prayers for the country. Adesina, Attahiru, as well as nine other military officers were aboard the jet when it crashed around 6pm on Friday. The late sergeant had on April 30 shared a story “Something bad is going to happen in Nigeria in May” on his Facebook page and asked for prayers for the country. Adesina had written, “This parable is heavy. Me and you need to pray for our country Nigeria.” The attached link was a report quoting the General Overseer of the Champions Royal Assembly, Joshua Iginla, warning about heavy clouds on the country in May, June and July. “Mark all I have said in parables. My spirit boils. For the past six months, God has been revealing to me some things that are hard for me to say. We need to pray for Nigeria. “What is coming ahead in the next three months is not good, that’s May, June, and July. I can’t talk more than this. We need to pray for Nigeria,” Iginla had said. Meanwhile, Adesina died alongside others about three weeks after his five-month-old daughter’s dedication.  Nigeria Army Chief, General Ibrahim Attahiru dies in air crash
