Juventus is preparing to make a shock move for Everton striker, Moise Kean, to replace Cristiano Ronaldo, according to Tuttosport. Ronaldo’s future with the deposed Serie A champions was thrown into doubt after it became mathematically impossible for them to retain the Scudetto. The Portugal captain could choose to end his time in Turin if Juve, who are currently fifth on the league table miss out on Champions League football. The club’s top brass are already preparing for life without the five-time Ballon d’Or winner, by lining up a bid for Kean. They will look to sign two new strikers if Ronaldo departs. Juventus sold Italy international Kean to Everton two years ago for an initial fee of £25 million. Real Madrid vs Chelsea: Tuchel tasks players ahead of Champions League tie
