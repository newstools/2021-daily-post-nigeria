Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, has described controversial Islamic cleric, Sheikh Agamas Gumi as a pure evil. Fani-Kayode made the remark while insisting that Gumi was a terrorist. In a tweet, the former minister warned against trusting the Islamic scholar. He wrote: “Sheik Ahmad Gumi is the physical manifestation and living personification of unadulterated and pure evil. “He speaks peace but war is in his heart. “Behind his seemingly gentle visage and soft words lies a hungry and insatiable wolf that thirsts for blood. “He is the quintessential Janjaweed terrorist: a man with no morals and no scruples. “He reminds me of the Pied Piper of Hamlin that led the children away. Those who trust him do so at their own peril.” This is coming at a time Deji Adeyanju, convener of Concerned Nigerian advocacy group called on President Muhammadu Buhari to arrest Gumi over his interaction with bandits.
